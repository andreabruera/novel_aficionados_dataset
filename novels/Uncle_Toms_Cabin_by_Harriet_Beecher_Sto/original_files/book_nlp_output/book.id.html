<p/>Late in the afternoon of a chilly day in February, two gentlemen were sitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in the town of P--, in Kentucky.
<p/>There were no servants present, and the gentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some subject with great earnestness.
<p/>I CHAPTER I In Which the Reader Is Introduced to a Man of Humanity For convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two gentlemen .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was a short, thick-set man, with coarse, commonplace features, and that swaggering air of pretension which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way upward in the world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was much over-dressed, in a gaudy vest of many colors, a blue neckerchief, bedropped gayly with yellow spots, and arranged with a flaunting tie, quite in keeping with the general air of the man.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, large and coarse, were plentifully bedecked with rings; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a heavy gold watch-chain, with a bundle of seals of portentous size, and a great variety of colors, attached to it,--which, in the ardor of conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the habit of flourishing and jingling with evident satisfaction.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conversation was in free and easy defiance of Murray's Grammar,* and was garnished at convenient intervals with various profane expressions, which not even the desire to be graphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe.
<p/>One of the parties, however, when critically examined, did not seem, strictly speaking, to come under the species. * English Grammar -LRB-1795-RRB-, by Lindley Murray -LRB-1745-1826-RRB-, the most authoritative American grammarian of his (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) day.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Murray</b></font>) companion, Mr. Shelby, had the appearance of a gentleman; and the arrangements of the house, and the general air of the housekeeping, indicated easy, and even opulent circumstances.
<p/>As we before stated, the two were in the midst of an earnest conversation. '' That is the way I should arrange the matter,'' said Mr. Shelby.
<p/>I can't make trade that way--I positively can't, Mr. Shelby,'' said the other, holding up a glass of wine between his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) eye and the light.
<p/>, Tom is an uncommon fellow; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is certainly worth that sum anywhere,--steady, honest, capable, manages my whole farm like a clock.''
<p/>'' '' Why, the fact is, Haley <div class="bookquote">``You mean honest, as niggers go,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, helping himself to a glass of brandy.
<p/>'' No; I mean, really, Tom is a good, steady, sensible, pious fellow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got religion at a camp-meeting, four years ago; and I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) really did get it.
<p/>I've trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), since then, with everything I have,--money, house, horses,--and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) come and go round the country; and I always found him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) true and square in everything.
<p/>Some folks don't believe there is pious niggers Shelby,'' said Haley, with a candid flourish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``but I do .
<p/>last lot I took to Orleans--'t was as good as a meetin, now, really, to hear that critter pray; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was quite gentle and quiet like.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) fetched me a good sum, too, for I bought him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) cheap of a man that was `bliged to sell out; so I realized six hundred on him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>'' I had a fellow, now, in this yer Yes, I consider religion a valeyable thing in a nigger, when it's the genuine article, and no mistake.''
<p/>Why, last fall, I let him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) go to Cincinnati alone, to do business for me, and bring home five hundred dollars. '
<p/>'' Well, Tom's got the real article, if ever a fellow had,'' rejoined the other. '' Tom,' says I to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), 'I trust you, because I think you're a Christian--I know you wouldn't cheat.'
<p/>Tom comes back, sure enough; I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would. Some low fellows, they say, said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)-- Tom, why don't you make tracks for Canada?' '
<p/>Ah, master trusted me, and I couldn't,'--they told me about it. I am sorry to part with Tom, I must say.
<p/>You ought to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cover the whole balance of the debt; and you would, Haley, if you had any conscience.''
<p/>Well, I've got just as much conscience as any man in business can afford to keep,--just a little, you know, to swear by, as 't were,'' said the trader, jocularly; <div class="bookquote">``and, then, I'm ready to do anything in reason to `blige friends; but this yer, you see, is a leetle too hard on a fellow--a leetle too hard.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader yer</b></font>)</div>'' The trader sighed contemplatively, and poured out some more brandy. '' Well, then, Haley, how will you trade?'' said Mr. Shelby, after an uneasy interval of silence.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hum!--none that I could well spare; to tell the truth, it's only hard necessity makes me willing to sell at all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy gal</b></font>)</div>Well, haven't you a boy or gal that you could throw in with Tom?'' I don't like parting with any of my hands, that's a fact.
<p/>'' Here the door opened, and a small quadroon boy, between four and five years of age, entered the room. There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) appearance remarkably beautiful and engaging.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) black hair, fine as floss silk, hung in glossy curls about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) round, dimpled face, while a pair of large dark eyes, full of fire and softness, looked out from beneath the rich, long lashes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) peered curiously into the apartment.
<p/>A gay robe of scarlet and yellow plaid, carefully made and neatly fitted, set off to advantage the dark and rich style of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) beauty; and a certain comic air of assurance, blended with bashfulness, showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been not unused to being petted and noticed by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) master.
<p/>'' Hulloa, Jim Crow!'' said Mr. Shelby, whistling, and snapping a bunch of raisins towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``pick that up, now! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The child scampered, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) little strength, after the prize, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) master laughed. <div class="bookquote">``Come here, Jim Crow,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crow</b></font>).
<p/>The child came up, and the master patted the curly head, and chucked him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) under the chin. '' Now, Jim, show this gentleman how you can dance and sing.
<p/>The boy commenced one of those wild, grotesque songs common among the negroes, in a rich, clear voice, accompanying his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) singing with many comic evolutions of the hands, feet, and whole body, all in perfect time to the music.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Bravo!''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) a quarter of an orange. '' Now, Jim, walk like old Uncle Cudjoe, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) has the rheumatism,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) master.
<p/>Instantly the flexible limbs of the child assumed the appearance of deformity and distortion, as, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) back humped up, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) master's stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hobbled about the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) childish face drawn into a doleful pucker, and spitting from right to left, in imitation of an old man.
<p/>The boy drew his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chubby face down to a formidable length, and commenced toning a psalm tune through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) nose, with imperturbable gravity.
<p/>Both gentlemen laughed uproariously. '' Now, Jim,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) master, <div class="bookquote">``show us how old Elder Robbins leads the psalm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Tell you what,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Robbins</b></font>), suddenly clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Robbins</b></font>) hand on Mr. Shelby's shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``fling in that chap, and I'll settle the business--I will.
<p/>Hurrah! bravo! what a young `un!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Haley; <div class="bookquote">``that chap's a case, I'll promise. Come, now, if that ain't doing the thing up about the rightest!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><p/>At this moment, the door was pushed gently open, and a young quadroon woman, apparently about twenty-five, entered the room. There needed only a glance from the child to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to identify her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) as its mother.
<p/>The brown of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) complexion gave way on the cheek to a perceptible flush, which deepened as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw the gaze of the strange man fixed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in bold and undisguised admiration.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress was of the neatest possible fit, and set off to advantage her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finely moulded shape;--a delicately formed hand and a trim foot and ankle were items of appearance that did not escape the quick eye of the trader, well used to run up at a glance the points of a fine female article.
<p/>There was the same rich, full, dark eye, with its long lashes; the same ripples of silky black hair. '' Well, Eliza?'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) master, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) stopped and looked hesitatingly at him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>I was looking for Harry, please, sir;'' and the boy bounded toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spoils, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had gathered in the skirt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) robe.
<p/>'' '' Well, take him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) away then,'' said Mr. Shelby; and hastily she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) withdrew, carrying the child on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) arm. ''
<p/>By Jupiter,'' said the trader, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) in admiration, ``there's an article, now! You might make your fortune on that ar gal in Orleans, any day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to make my fortune on her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shelby, dryly; and, seeking to turn the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) uncorked a bottle of fresh wine, and asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) companion's opinion of it.
<p/>I've seen over a thousand, in my day, paid down for gals not a bit handsomer. '' '' Capital, sir,--first chop!'' said the trader; then turning, and slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) hand familiarly on Shelby's shoulder
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) added-- <div class="bookquote">``Come, how will you trade about the gal?--what shall I say for her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)-- what'll you take?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mr. Haley, she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) is not to be sold,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Shelby.
<p/>'' My wife would not part with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) weight in gold.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay! women always say such things, cause they ha`nt no sort of calculation.
<p/>Just show 'em how many watches, feathers, and trinkets, one's weight in gold would buy, and that alters the case, I reckon.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I tell you, Haley, this must not be spoken of ; I say no, and I mean no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Shelby, decidedly.
<p/>'' Well, you'll let me have the boy, though,'' said the trader; <div class="bookquote">``you must own I've come down pretty handsomely for him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>).
<p/>Why, I've got a friend that's going into this yer branch of the business--wants to buy up handsome boys to raise for the market.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>'' What on earth can you want with the child?'' said Shelby. '' Fancy articles entirely--sell for waiters, and so on, to rich `uns, that can pay for handsome `uns.
<p/>It sets off one of yer great places--a real handsome boy to open door, wait, and tend. They fetch a good sum; and this little devil is such a comical, musical concern, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>)'s just the article!'
<p/>I would rather not sell him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>),'' said Mr. Shelby, thoughtfully; <div class="bookquote">``the fact is, sir, I'm a humane man, and I hate to take the boy from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``O, you do?--La! yes--something of that ar natur. I understand, perfectly. It is mighty onpleasant getting on with women, sometimes, I al`ays hates these yer screechin,' screamin' times.
<p/>Now, what if you get the girl off for a day, or a week, or so; then the thing's done quietly,--all over before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes home.
<p/>They are mighty onpleasant; but, as I manages business, I generally avoids 'em, sir. Your wife might get her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) some ear-rings, or a new gown, or some such truck, to make up with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I'm afraid not.'' <div class="bookquote">``Lor bless ye, yes! These critters ain't like white folks, you know ; they gets over things, only manage right.
<p/>Now, they say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, assuming a candid and confidential air, <div class="bookquote">``that this kind o' trade is hardening to the feelings; but I never found it so.
<p/>I've seen 'em as would pull a woman's child out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) up to sell, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) screechin' like mad all the time;--very bad policy--damages the article--makes 'em quite unfit for service sometimes.
<p/>Fact is, I never could do things up the way some fellers manage the business. I knew a real handsome gal once, in Orleans, as was entirely ruined by this sort o' handling.
<p/>The fellow that was trading for her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) didn't want her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) baby; and she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) was one of your real high sort, when her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) blood was up.
<p/>It kinder makes my blood run cold to think of `t; and when they carried off the child, and locked her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) up, she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) jest went ravin' mad, and died in a week.
<p/>I tell you, she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) squeezed up her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) child in her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) arms, and talked, and went on real awful. Clear waste, sir, of a thousand dollars, just for want of management,--there's where 't is.
<p/>And the trader leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) chair, and folded his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) arm, with an air of virtuous decision, apparently considering himself a second Wilberforce.
<p/>The subject appeared to interest the gentleman deeply; for while Mr. Shelby was thoughtfully peeling an orange, Haley broke out afresh, with becoming diffidence, but as if actually driven by the force of truth to say a few words more.
<p/>It don't look well, now, for a feller to be praisin' himself; but I say it jest because it's the truth.
<p/>I believe I'm reckoned to bring in about the finest droves of niggers that is brought in,--at least, I've been told so; if I have once, I reckon I have a hundred times,--all in good case,--fat and likely, and I lose as few as any man in the business.
<p/>And I lays it all to my management, sir; and humanity, sir, I may say, is the great pillar of my management.
<p/>It's always best to do the humane thing, sir; that's been my experience. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>'' '' Mr. Shelby did not know what to say, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I've been laughed at for my notions, sir, and I've been talked to. They an't pop`lar, and they an't common; but I stuck to 'em, sir
<p/>; I've stuck to 'em, and realized well on 'em; yes, sir, they have paid their passage, I may say,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>and the trader laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) joke.
<p/>There was something so piquant and original in these elucidations of humanity, that Mr. Shelby could not help laughing in company.
<p/>Perhaps you laugh too, dear reader; but you know humanity comes out in a variety of strange forms now-a-days, and there is no end to the odd things that humane people will say and do.
<p/>Mr. Shelby's laugh encouraged the trader to proceed. '' It's strange, now, but I never could beat this into people's heads.
<p/>Now, there was Tom Loker, my old partner, down in Natchez; he (<font color='blue'><b>Loker</b></font>) was a clever fellow, Tom was, only the very devil with niggers,--on principle 't was, you see, for a better hearted feller never broke bread; 't was his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) system , sir.
<p/>Why, Tom,' I used to say, `when your gals takes on and cry, what's the use o' crackin on' em over the head, and knockin' on 'em round?
<p/>I used to talk to Tom. ' It's ridiculous,' says I, `and don't do no sort o' good. Why, I don't see no harm in their cryin',' says I; `it's natur,' says I, `and
<p/>Besides, Tom,' says I, `it jest spiles your gals; they get sickly, and down in the mouth; and sometimes they gets ugly,--particular yallow gals
<p/>if natur can't blow off one way, it will another. do,--and it's the devil and all gettin' on 'em broke in.
<p/>Depend on it, Tom, a little humanity, thrown in along, goes a heap further than all your jawin' and crackin'; and it pays better,' says I, `depend on `t.'
<p/>But Tom couldn't get the hang on `t; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spiled so many for me, that I had to break off with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was a good-hearted fellow, and as fair a business hand as is goin'.
<p/>Now,' says I, `why can't you kinder coax 'em up, and speak 'em fair? '' '' And do you find your ways of managing do the business better than Tom's?'' said Mr. Shelby.
<p/>You see, when I any ways can, I takes a leetle care about the onpleasant parts, like selling young uns and that,--get the gals out of the way--out of sight, out of mind, you know,--and when it's clean done, and can't be helped, they naturally gets used to it. '
<p/>Tan't, you know, as if it was white folks, that's brought up in the way of `spectin' to keep their children and wives, and all that.
<p/>Niggers, you know, that's fetched up properly, ha'n't no kind of `spectations of no kind; so all these things comes easier.
<p/>'' Why, yes, sir, I may say so. '' '' I'm afraid mine are not properly brought up, then,'' said Mr. Shelby.
<p/>Now, a nigger, you see, what's got to be hacked and tumbled round the world, and sold to Tom, and Dick, and the Lord knows who, `tan't no kindness to be givin' on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) notions and expectations, and bringin' on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) up too well, for the rough and tumble comes all the harder on him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) arter.
<p/>Now, I venture to say, your niggers would be quite chop-fallen in a place where some of your plantation niggers would be singing and whooping like all possessed.
<p/>Every man, you know, Mr. Shelby, naturally thinks well of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) own ways; and I think I treat niggers just about as well as it's ever worth while to treat 'em.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``S'pose not; you Kentucky folks spile your niggers. You mean well by 'em, but `tan't no real kindness, arter all. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div><p/>It's a happy thing to be satisfied,'' said Mr. Shelby, with a slight shrug, and some perceptible feelings of a disagreeable nature.
<p/>'' Well,'' said Haley, after they had both silently picked their nuts for a season, <div class="bookquote">``what do you say?''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll think the matter over, and talk with my wife,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shelby.
<p/>Meantime, Haley, if you want the matter carried on in the quiet way you speak of, you'd best not let your business in this neighborhood be known.
<p/>It will get out among my boys, and it will not be a particularly quiet business getting away any of my fellows, if they know it, I'll promise you.''
<p/>I'm in a devil of a hurry, and shall want to know, as soon as possible, what I may depend on,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), rising and putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) overcoat.
<p/>Well, call up this evening, between six and seven, and you shall have my answer,'' said Mr. Shelby, and the trader bowed himself out of the apartment.
<p/>I'd like to have been able to kick the fellow down the steps,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) saw the door fairly closed, <div class="bookquote">``with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) impudent assurance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows how much he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has me at advantage.
<p/>If anybody had ever said to me that I should sell Tom down south to one of those rascally traders, I should have said, `Is thy servant a dog, that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) should do this thing?'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O! certainly, by all means, mum! of course. But I'll tell you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And now it must come, for aught I see.
<p/>And Eliza's child, too! I know that I shall have some fuss with wife about that; and, for that matter, about Tom, too.
<p/>So much for being in debt,--heigho! The fellow sees his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) advantage, and means to push it. '' Perhaps the mildest form of the system of slavery is to be seen in the State of Kentucky.
<p/>The general prevalence of agricultural pursuits of a quiet and gradual nature, not requiring those periodic seasons of hurry and pressure that are called for in the business of more southern districts, makes the task of the negro a more healthful and reasonable one; while the master, content with a more gradual style of acquisition, has not those temptations to hardheartedness which always overcome frail human nature when the prospect of sudden and rapid gain is weighed in the balance, with no heavier counterpoise than the interests of the helpless and unprotected.
<p/>Whoever visits some estates there, and witnesses the good-humored indulgence of some masters and mistresses, and the affectionate loyalty of some slaves, might be tempted to dream the oft-fabled poetic legend of a patriarchal institution, and all that; but over and above the scene there broods a portentous shadow--the shadow of law .
<p/>So long as the law considers all these human beings, with beating hearts and living affections, only as so many things belonging to a master,--so long as the failure, or misfortune, or imprudence, or death of the kindest owner, may cause them any day to exchange a life of kind protection and indulgence for one of hopeless misery and toil,--so long it is impossible to make anything beautiful or desirable in the best regulated administration of slavery.
<p/>Mr. Shelby was a fair average kind of man, good-natured and kindly, and disposed to easy indulgence of those around him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>), and there had never been a lack of anything which might contribute to the physical comfort of the negroes on his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) estate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) had, however, speculated largely and quite loosely; had involved himself deeply, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) notes to a large amount had come into the hands of Haley; and this small piece of information is the key to the preceding conversation.
<p/>Now, it had so happened that, in approaching the door, Eliza had caught enough of the conversation to know that a trader was making offers to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) master for somebody.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) would gladly have stopped at the door to listen, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) came out; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistress just then calling, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was obliged to hasten away.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) heart swelled and throbbed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) involuntarily strained him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) so tight that the little fellow looked up into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) face in astonishment.
<p/>Eliza, girl, what ails you today?'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistress, when Eliza had upset the wash-pitcher, knocked down the workstand, and finally was abstractedly offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistress a long nightgown in place of the silk dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to bring from the wardrobe.
<p/>Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) heard the trader make an offer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) boy;--could she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) be mistaken? '' Eliza started. '' O, missis!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) eyes; then, bursting into tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) sat down in a chair, and began sobbing. '' Why, Eliza child, what ails you?'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistress.
<p/>'' O! missis, missis,'' said Eliza, <div class="bookquote">``there's been a trader talking with master in the parlor! I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, silly child, suppose there has.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, missis, do you suppose mas'r would sell my Harry? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>And the poor creature threw herself into a chair, and sobbed convulsively.
<p/>You know your master never deals with those southern traders, and never means to sell any of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) servants, as long as they behave well.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sell him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)! No, you foolish girl! Why, you silly child, who do you think would want to buy your Harry? Do you think all the world are set on him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) as you are, you goosie?
<p/>There now, put my back hair up in that pretty braid you learnt the other day, and don't go listening at doors any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Come, cheer up, and hook my dress. '' Well, but, missis, you never would give your consent--to--to-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, child! to be sure, I shouldn't.
<p/>What do you talk so for? I would as soon have one of my own children sold. But really, Eliza, you are getting altogether too proud of that little fellow.
<p/>Reassured by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistress' confident tone, Eliza proceeded nimbly and adroitly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) toilet, laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own fears, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) proceeded.
<p/>A man can't put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose into the door, but you think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be coming to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Shelby was a woman of high class, both intellectually and morally.
<p/>To that natural magnanimity and generosity of mind which one often marks as characteristic of the women of Kentucky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) added high moral and religious sensibility and principle, carried out with great energy and ability into practical results.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) husband, who made no professions to any particular religious character, nevertheless reverenced and respected the consistency of hers, and stood, perhaps, a little in awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) opinion.
<p/>Certain it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) unlimited scope in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) benevolent efforts for the comfort, instruction, and improvement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) servants, though he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) never took any decided part in them himself.
<p/>In fact, if not exactly a believer in the doctrine of the efficiency of the extra good works of saints, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) really seemed somehow or other to fancy that his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife had piety and benevolence enough for two--to indulge a shadowy expectation of getting into heaven through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) superabundance of qualities to which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) made no particular pretension.
<p/>The heaviest load on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind, after his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) conversation with the trader, lay in the foreseen necessity of breaking to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife the arrangement contemplated,--meeting the importunities and opposition which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should have reason to encounter.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby, being entirely ignorant of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) husband's embarrassments, and knowing only the general kindliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) temper, had been quite sincere in the entire incredulity with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) had met Eliza's suspicions.
<p/>In fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) dismissed the matter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) mind, without a second thought; and being occupied in preparations for an evening visit, it passed out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) thoughts entirely.
<p/>The traveller in the south must often have remarked that peculiar air of refinement, that softness of voice and manner, which seems in many cases to be a particular gift to the quadroon and mulatto women.
<p/>These natural graces in the quadroon are often united with beauty of the most dazzling kind, and in almost every case with a personal appearance prepossessing and agreeable.
<p/>Eliza, such as we have described her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), is not a fancy sketch, but taken from remembrance, as we saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), years ago, in Kentucky.
<p/>Safe under the protecting care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistress, Eliza had reached maturity without those temptations which make beauty so fatal an inheritance to a slave.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had been married to a bright and talented young mulatto man, who was a slave on a neighboring estate, and bore the name of George Harris.
<p/>This young man had been hired out by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master to work in a bagging factory, where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adroitness and ingenuity caused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be considered the first hand in the place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had invented a machine for the cleaning of the hemp, which, considering the education and circumstances of the inventor, displayed quite as much mechanical genius as Whitney's cotton-gin.
<p/>CHAPTER II The Mother Eliza had been brought up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistress, from girlhood, as a petted and indulged favorite. *
<p/>* A machine of this description was really the invention of a young colored man in Kentucky. -LSB-Mrs. Stowe's note.-RSB- He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was possessed of a handsome person and pleasing manners, and was a general favorite in the factory.
<p/>Nevertheless, as this young man was in the eye of the law not a man, but a thing, all these superior qualifications were subject to the control of a vulgar, narrow-minded, tyrannical master.
<p/>This same gentleman, having heard of the fame of George's invention, took a ride over to the factory, to see what this intelligent chattel had been about.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was waited upon over the factory, shown the machinery by George, who, in high spirits, talked so fluently, held himself so erect, looked so handsome and manly, that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) master began to feel an uneasy consciousness of inferiority.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was received with great enthusiasm by the employer, who congratulated him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) on possessing so valuable a slave. What business had his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) slave to be marching round the country, inventing machines, and holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) head among gentlemen?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)'d soon put a stop to it. He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)'d take him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) back, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) to hoeing and digging, and <div class="bookquote">``see if he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>)'d step about so smart.
<p/>Accordingly, the manufacturer and all hands concerned were astounded when he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) suddenly demanded George's wages, and announced his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) intention of taking him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) home.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' But, Mr. Harris,'' remonstrated the manufacturer, <div class="bookquote">``isn't this rather sudden?''  (<font color='red'><b>the manufacturer</b></font>)</div>'' What if it is?--isn't the man mine ?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We would be willing, sir, to increase the rate of compensation.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No object at all, sir. I don't need to hire any of my hands out, unless I've a mind to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But, sir, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seems peculiarly adapted to this business.'' <div class="bookquote">``Dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be; never was much adapted to anything that I set him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about, I'll be bound.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the workmen</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But only think of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inventing this machine,'' interposed one of the workmen, rather unluckily. '' O yes! a machine for saving work, is it?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d invent that, I'll be bound; let a nigger alone for that, any time. They are all labor-saving machines themselves, every one of 'em.
<p/>George had stood like one transfixed, at hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) doom thus suddenly pronounced by a power that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knew was irresistible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) folded his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms, tightly pressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lips, but a whole volcano of bitter feelings burned in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bosom, and sent streams of fire through his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) veins.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breathed short, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) large dark eyes flashed like live coals; and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) might have broken out into some dangerous ebullition, had not the kindly manufacturer touched him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) on the arm, and said, in a low tone, <div class="bookquote">``Give way, George; go with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) for the present.
<p/>The tyrant observed the whisper, and conjectured its import, though he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) could not hear what was said; and he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) inwardly strengthened himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) determination to keep the power he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) possessed over his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) victim.
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) shall tramp! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>We'll try to help you, yet. '' George was taken home, and put to the meanest drudgery of the farm.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been able to repress every disrespectful word; but the flashing eye, the gloomy and troubled brow, were part of a natural language that could not be repressed,--indubitable signs, which showed too plainly that the man could not become a thing.
<p/>It was during the happy period of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) employment in the factory that George had seen and married his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife. During that period,--being much trusted and favored by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) employer,--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had free liberty to come and go at discretion.
<p/>The marriage was highly approved of by Mrs. Shelby, who, with a little womanly complacency in match-making, felt pleased to unite her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) handsome favorite with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) own class who seemed in every way suited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>); and so they were married in her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) mistress' great parlor, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) mistress herself adorned the bride's beautiful hair with orange-blossoms, and threw over it
<p/>the bridal veil, which certainly could scarce have rested on a fairer head; and there was no lack of white gloves, and cake and wine,--of admiring guests to praise the bride's beauty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mistress' indulgence and liberality.
<p/>For a year or two Eliza saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband frequently, and there was nothing to interrupt their happiness, except the loss of two infant children, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was passionately attached, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mourned with a grief so intense as to call for gentle remonstrance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistress, who sought, with maternal anxiety, to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) naturally passionate feelings within the bounds of reason and religion.
<p/>After the birth of little Harry, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had gradually become tranquillized and settled; and every bleeding tie and throbbing nerve, once more entwined with that little life, seemed to become sound and healthful, and Eliza was a happy woman up to the time that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband was rudely torn from his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) kind employer, and brought under the iron sway of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) legal owner.
<p/>The manufacturer, true to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) word, visited Mr. Harris a week or two after George had been taken away, when, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hoped, the heat of the occasion had passed away, and tried every possible inducement to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to restore him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) former employment.
<p/>'' You needn't trouble yourself to talk any longer,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), doggedly; <div class="bookquote">``I know my own business, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did not presume to interfere with it, sir.
<p/>I only thought that you might think it for your interest to let your man to us on the terms proposed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I saw your winking and whispering, the day I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out of the factory; but you don't come it over me that way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, I understand the matter well enough. It's a free country, sir; the man's mine , and I do what I please with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--that's it!
<p/>And so fell George's last hope;--nothing before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) but a life of toil and drudgery, rendered more bitter by every little smarting vexation and indignity which tyrannical ingenuity could devise.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>A jurist</b></font>)</div>A very humane jurist once said, The worst use you can put a man to is to hang him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). No; there is another use that a man can be put to that is WORSE!
<p/>The Husband and Father Mrs. Shelby had gone on her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) visit, and Eliza stood in the verandah, rather dejectedly looking after the retreating carriage, when a hand was laid on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>CHAPTER III She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) turned, and a bright smile lighted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) fine eyes. '' George, is it you? How you frightened me!
<p/>Missis is gone to spend the afternoon; so come into my little room, and we'll have the time all to ourselves.
<p/>Saying this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) into a neat little apartment opening on the verandah, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) generally sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) sewing, within call of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mistress.
<p/>Well; I am so glad you 's come! '' '' How glad I am!--why don't you smile?--and look at Harry--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) grows.
<p/>'' The boy stood shyly regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) father through his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) curls, holding close to the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother's dress. ''
<p/>Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beautiful?'' said Eliza, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) long curls and kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). '' I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'d never been born!'' said George, bitterly.
<p/>'' I wish I'd never been born myself!'' Surprised and frightened, Eliza sat down, leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband's shoulder, and burst into tears.
<p/>There now, Eliza, it's too bad for me to make you feel so, poor girl!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), fondly; <div class="bookquote">``it's too bad: O, how I wish you never had seen me--you might have been happy!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``George! George! how can you talk so? What dreadful thing has happened, or is going to happen? I'm sure we've been very happy, till lately.
<p/>Then drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) child on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knee, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gazed intently on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) glorious dark eyes, and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands through his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) long curls.

<p/>What's the use of our trying to do anything, trying to know anything, trying to be anything? What's the use of living?

 (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>There is some sense in it, in your case; they have brought you up like a child, fed you, clothed you, indulged you, and taught you, so that you have a good education; that is some reason why they should claim you.
<p/>But I have been kicked and cuffed and sworn at, and at the best only let alone; and what do I owe?
<p/>That's what I want to know! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) said. '' '' I've paid for all my keeping a hundred times over.
<p/>I won't bear it. No, I won't ! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) said, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) hand with a fierce frown. Eliza trembled, and was silent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband in this mood before; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) gentle system of ethics seemed to bend like a reed in the surges of such passions.
<p/>You know poor little Carlo, that you gave me,'' added George; <div class="bookquote">``the creature has been about all the comfort that I've had.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has slept with me nights, and followed me around days, and kind o' looked at me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) understood how I felt.
<p/>Well, the other day I was just feeding him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with a few old scraps I picked up by the kitchen door, and Mas'r came along, and said I was feeding him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) expense, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) couldn't afford to have every nigger keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dog, and ordered me to tie a stone to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) neck and throw him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in the pond.''

<p/>I don't care. Mas'r will find out that I'm one that whipping won't tame. My day will come yet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) don't look out.

<p/>'' I wish I could be good; but my heart burns, and can't be reconciled, anyhow. You couldn't in my place,--you can't now, if I tell you all I've got to say.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, lately Mas'r has been saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a fool to let me marry off the place; that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hates Mr. Shelby and all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tribe, because they are proud, and hold their heads up above him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and that I've got proud notions from you; and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) won't let me come here any more, and that I shall take a wife and settle down on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) place.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) only scolded and grumbled these things; but yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told me that I should take Mina for a wife, and settle down in a cabin with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mina</b></font>), or he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would sell me down river.''

<p/>There is no law in this country for that; I can't hold you for my wife, if he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) chooses to part us.
<p/>I wish I'd never been born; it would have been better for us both,--it would have been better for this poor child if he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) had never been born.
<p/>That's why I wish I'd never seen you,--why All this may happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) yet!'' '' O, but master is so kind!''
<p/>'' Yes, but who knows?--he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) may die--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) may be sold to nobody knows who. What pleasure is it that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is handsome, and smart, and bright?
<p/>I tell you, Eliza, that a sword will pierce through your soul for every good and pleasant thing your child is or has; it will make him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) worth too much for you to keep.
<p/>The words smote heavily on Eliza's heart; the vision of the trader came before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) eyes, and, as if some one had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) a deadly blow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) turned pale and gasped for breath.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) looked nervously out on the verandah, where the boy, tired of the grave conversation, had retired, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was riding triumphantly up and down on Mr. Shelby's walking-stick.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They stood silent; then there were last words, and sobs, and bitter weeping,--such parting as those may make whose hope to meet again is as the spider's web,--and the husband and wife were parted.
<p/>'' Well, now, good-by ,'' said George, holding Eliza's hands, and gazing into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) eyes, without moving. CHAPTER IV An Evening in
<p/>The cabin of Uncle Tom was a small log building, close adjoining to <div class="bookquote">``the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>as the negro par excellence designates his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master's dwelling.
<p/>In front it had a neat garden-patch, where, every summer, strawberries, raspberries, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, flourished under careful tending.
<p/>The whole front of it was covered by a large scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose, which, entwisting and interlacing, left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to be seen.
<p/>Here, also, in summer, various brilliant annuals, such as marigolds, petunias, four-o'clocks, found an indulgent corner in which to unfold their splendors, and were the delight and pride of Aunt Chloe's heart.
<p/>The evening meal at the house is over, and Aunt Chloe, who presided over its preparation as head cook, has left to inferior officers in the kitchen the business of clearing away and washing dishes, and come out into her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) own snug territories, to <div class="bookquote">``get her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) ole man's supper'' (<font color='red'><b>officers</b></font>)</div>; therefore, doubt not that it is her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) you see by the fire, presiding with anxious interest over certain frizzling items in a stew-pan, and anon with grave consideration lifting the cover of a bake-kettle, from whence steam forth indubitable intimations of <div class="bookquote">``something good.
<p/>A round, black, shining face is hers, so glossy as to suggest the idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) might have been washed over with white of eggs, like one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) own tea rusks.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) whole plump countenance beams with satisfaction and contentment from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) well-starched checked turban, bearing on it, however, if we must confess it, a little of that tinge of self-consciousness which becomes the first cook of the neighborhood, as Aunt Chloe was universally held and acknowledged to be.
<p/>Uncle Tom's Cabin Let us enter the dwelling. ''  (<font color='red'><b>anon</b></font>)</div>A cook she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) certainly was, in the very bone and centre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) soul.
<p/>Not a chicken or turkey or duck in the barn-yard but looked grave when they saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) approaching, and seemed evidently to be reflecting on their latter end; and certain it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) was always meditating on trussing, stuffing and roasting, to a degree that was calculated to inspire terror in any reflecting fowl living.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) corn-cake, in all its varieties of hoe-cake, dodgers, muffins, and other species too numerous to mention, was a sublime mystery to all less practised compounders; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) would shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) fat sides with honest pride and merriment, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) would narrate the fruitless efforts that one and another of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) compeers had made to attain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) elevation.
<p/>The arrival of company at the house, the arranging of dinners and suppers <div class="bookquote">``in style,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>awoke all the energies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) soul; and no sight was more welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) than a pile of travelling trunks launched on the verandah, for
<p/>Just at present, however, Aunt Chloe is looking into the bake-pan; in which congenial operation we shall leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) till we finish our picture of the cottage.
<p/>In one corner of it stood a bed, covered neatly with a snowy spread; and by the side of it was a piece of carpeting, of some considerable size.
<p/>On this piece of carpeting Aunt Chloe took her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) stand, as being decidedly in the upper walks of life; and it and the bed by which it lay, and the whole corner, in fact, were treated with distinguished consideration, and made, so far as possible, sacred from the marauding inroads and desecrations of little folks.
<p/>then she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) foresaw fresh efforts and fresh triumphs. In fact, that corner was the drawing-room of the establishment. In the other corner was a bed of much humbler pretensions, and evidently designed for use .
<p/>The wall over the fireplace was adorned with some very brilliant scriptural prints, and a portrait of General Washington, drawn and colored in a manner which would certainly have astonished that hero, if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) happened to meet with its like.
<p/>On a rough bench in the corner, a couple of woolly-headed boys, with glistening black eyes and fat shining cheeks, were busy in superintending the first walking operations of the baby, which, as is usually the case, consisted in getting up on its feet, balancing a moment, and then tumbling down,--each successive failure being violently cheered, as something decidedly clever.
<p/>A table, somewhat rheumatic in its limbs, was drawn out in front of the fire, and covered with a cloth, displaying cups and saucers of a decidedly brilliant pattern, with other symptoms of an approaching meal.
<p/>At this table was seated Uncle Tom, Mr. Shelby's best hand, who, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) is to be the hero of our story, we must daguerreotype for our readers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was a large, broad-chested, powerfully-made man, of a full glossy black, and a face whose truly African features were characterized by an expression of grave and steady good sense, united with much kindliness and benevolence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was very busily intent at this moment on a slate lying before him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>), on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was carefully and slowly endeavoring to accomplish a copy of some letters, in which operation he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was overlooked by young Mas'r George, a smart, bright boy of thirteen, who appeared fully to realize the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) position as instructor.
<p/>There was something about his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) whole air self-respecting and dignified, yet united with a confiding and humble simplicity. '' Not that way, Uncle Tom,--not that way
<p/>,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), briskly, as Uncle Tom laboriously brought up the tail of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) g the wrong side out; <div class="bookquote">``that makes a q , you see.
<p/>La sakes, now, does it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle Tom</b></font>)</div>said Uncle Tom, looking with a respectful, admiring air, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) young teacher flourishingly scrawled q 's and g 's innumerable for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) edification; and then, taking the pencil in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) big, heavy fingers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) patiently recommenced.
<p/>How easy white folks al`us does things!'' said Aunt Chloe, pausing while she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) was greasing a griddle with a scrap of bacon on her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) fork, and regarding young Master George with pride.
<p/>'' '' '' '' The way he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) can write, now! and read, too! and then to come out here evenings and read his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lessons to us,--it's mighty interestin'!''
<p/>'' But, Aunt Chloe, I'm getting mighty hungry,'' said George. '' Isn't that cake in the skillet almost done?'' '' Mose done, Mas'r George,'' said Aunt Chloe, lifting the lid and peeping in,--<div class="bookquote">``browning beautiful--a real lovely brown.
<p/>Ah! let me alone for dat. Missis let Sally try to make some cake, t' other day, jes to larn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) said. '
<p/>O, go way, Missis,' said I; `it really hurts my feelin's, now, to see good vittles spilt dat ar way! Cake ris all to one side--no shape at all; no more than my shoe; go way!
<p/>And with this final expression of contempt for Sally's greenness, Aunt Chloe whipped the cover off the bake-kettle, and disclosed to view a neatly-baked pound-cake, of which no city confectioner need to have been ashamed.
<p/>This being evidently the central point of the entertainment, Aunt Chloe began now to bustle about earnestly in the supper department.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>'' Here you, Mose and Pete! get out de way, you niggers! Get away, Polly, honey,--mammy'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) baby some fin, by and by.
<p/>Now, Mas'r George, you jest take off dem books, and set down now with my old man, and I'll take up de sausages, and have de first griddle full of cakes on your plates in less dan no time.''
<p/>'' They wanted me to come to supper in the house,'' said George; <div class="bookquote">``but I knew what was what too well for that, Aunt Chloe.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>'' So you did-- so you did, honey,'' said Aunt Chloe, heaping the smoking batter-cakes on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) plate; <div class="bookquote">``you know'd your old aunty'd keep the best for you.
<p/>And, with that, aunty gave George a nudge with her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) finger, designed to be immensely facetious, and turned again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) griddle with great briskness.
<p/>Now for the cake,''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>said Mas'r George, when the activity of the griddle department had somewhat subsided; and, with that, the youngster flourished a large knife over the article in question.
<p/>O, let you alone for dat! Go way! '' '' '' La bless you, Mas'r George!'' said Aunt Chloe, with earnestness, catching his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``you wouldn't be for cuttin' it wid
<p/>dat ar great heavy knife! Smash all down--spile all de pretty rise of it. Here, I've got a thin old knife, I keeps sharp a purpose.

<p/>'' Well, though, I've heard you say,'' said George, <div class="bookquote">``that Jinny was a pretty fair cook. ''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>'' So I did,'' said Aunt Chloe,--<div class="bookquote">``I may say dat.

<p/>Here Aunt Chloe sighed, and rolled up her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) eyes with emotion. '' I'm sure, Aunt Chloe, I understand my pie and pudding privileges,'' said George.
<p/>Aunt Chloe sat back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) chair, and indulged in a hearty guffaw of laughter, at this witticism of young Mas`r's, laughing till the tears rolled down her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) black, shining cheeks, and varying the exercise with playfully slapping and poking Mas'r Georgey, and telling him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to go way, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a case--that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was fit to kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sartin would kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>), one of these days; and, between each of these sanguinary predictions, going off into a laugh, each longer and stronger than the other, till George really began to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a very dangerously witty fellow, and that it became him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to be careful how he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) talked <div class="bookquote">``as funny as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could.''

<p/>Say?--why, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kinder larfed in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes--dem great handsome eyes o' hern; and, says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), `Well, Aunt Chloe, I think you are about in the right on `t,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) went off in de parlor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) oughter cracked me over de head for bein' so sarcy; but dar's whar 't is--I can't do nothin' with ladies in de kitchen!''
<p/>'' '' Well, you made out well with that dinner,--I remember everybody said so,'' said George. '' Didn't I? And wan't I behind de dinin'-room door dat bery day?
<p/>and didn't I see de General pass his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) plate three times for some more dat bery pie?--and, says he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>), `You must have an uncommon cook, Mrs. Shelby.'
<p/>Lor! I was fit to split myself. '' And de Gineral, he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) knows what cookin' is,'' said Aunt Chloe, drawing herself up with an air.
<p/>'' Bery nice man, de Gineral! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comes of one of de bery fustest families in Old Virginny! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows what's what, now, as well as I do--de Gineral.
<p/>Ye see, there's pints in all pies, Mas'r George; but tan't everybody knows what they is, or as orter be. But the Gineral, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knows; I knew by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) `marks he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made.
<p/>By this time, Master George had arrived at that pass to which even a boy can come -LRB-under uncommon circumstances, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) really could not eat another morsel-RRB-, and, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was at leisure to notice the pile of woolly heads and glistening eyes which were regarding their operations hungrily from the opposite corner.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knows what de pints is! '' '' Here, you Mose, Pete,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) said, breaking off liberal bits, and throwing it at them; <div class="bookquote">``you want some, don't you?
<p/>And George and Tom moved to a comfortable seat in the chimney-corner, while Aunte Chloe, after baking a goodly pile of cakes, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) lap, and began alternately filling its mouth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) own, and distributing to Mose and Pete, who seemed rather to prefer eating theirs as they rolled about on the floor under the table, tickling each other, and occasionally pulling the baby's toes.
<p/>O! go long, will ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the mother, giving now and then a kick, in a kind of general way, under the table, when the movement became too obstreperous.
<p/>Come, Aunt Chloe, bake them some cakes. '' '' '' Can't ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye?
<p/>Stop dat ar, now, will ye? Better mind yerselves, or I'll take ye down a button-hole lower, when Mas'r George is gone!
<p/>What meaning was couched under this terrible threat, it is difficult to say; but certain it is that its awful indistinctness seemed to produce very little impression on the young sinners addressed.
<p/>'' '' La, now!'' said Uncle Tom, <div class="bookquote">``they are so full of tickle all the while, they can't behave theirselves. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Uncle Tom</b></font>)</div><p/>Here the boys emerged from under the table, and, with hands and faces well plastered with molasses, began a vigorous kissing of the baby.
<p/>'' Get along wid ye! '' said the mother, pushing away their woolly heads. '' Ye'll all stick together, and never get clar, if ye do dat fashion.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, seconding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exhortations by a slap, which resounded very formidably, but which seemed only to knock out so much more laugh from the young ones, as they tumbled precipitately over each other out of doors, where they fairly screamed with merriment.
<p/>Did ye ever see such aggravating young uns?'' said Aunt Chloe, rather complacently, as, producing an old towel, kept for such emergencies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) poured a little water out of the cracked tea-pot on it, and began rubbing off the molasses from the baby's face and hands; and, having polished her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) shone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) down in Tom's lap, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) busied herself in clearing away supper.
<p/>The baby employed the intervals in pulling Tom's nose, scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face, and burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) fat hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) woolly hair, which last operation seemed to afford her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) special content.
<p/>Aint she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) a peart young un?'' said Tom, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to take a full-length view; then, getting up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) broad shoulder, and began capering and dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>), while Mas'r George snapped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief, and Mose and Pete, now returned again, roared after her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) like bears, till Aunt Chloe declared that they <div class="bookquote">``fairly took her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) head off''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>with their noise.
<p/>As, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) own statement, this surgical operation was a matter of daily occurrence in the cabin, the declaration no whit abated the merriment, till every one had roared and tumbled and danced themselves down to a state of composure.
<p/>Well, now, I hopes you're done,'' said Aunt Chloe, who had been busy in pulling out a rude box of a trundle-bed; <div class="bookquote">``and now, you Mose and you Pete, get into thar; for we's goin' to have the meetin'.
<p/>Go long to de spring and wash yerselves! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``O mother, we don't wanter. We wants to sit up to meetin',--meetin's is so curis.
<p/>La, Aunt Chloe, shove it under, and let 'em sit up,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said Mas'r George, decisively, giving a push to the rude machine.
<p/>Aunt Chloe, having thus saved appearances, seemed highly delighted to push the thing under, saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) did so, <div class="bookquote">``Well, mebbe 't will do 'em some good.
<p/>We likes 'em.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' The house now resolved itself into a committee of the whole, to consider the accommodations and arrangements for the meeting.
<p/>As the meeting had been held at Uncle Tom's weekly, for an indefinite length of time, without any more <div class="bookquote">``cheers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>there seemed some encouragement to hope that a way would be discovered at present.
<p/>'' What we's to do for cheers, now, I declar I don't know,'' said Aunt Chloe. '' Old Uncle Peter sung both de legs out of dat oldest cheer, last week,'' suggested Mose.
<p/>'' You go long! I'll boun' you pulled 'em out; some o' your shines,'' said Aunt Chloe. '' Well, it'll stand, if it only keeps jam up agin de wall!'' said Mose.
<p/>'' Den Uncle Peter mus'n't sit in it, cause he (<font color='blue'><b>Mose</b></font>) al`ays hitches when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mose</b></font>) gets a singing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mose</b></font>) hitched pretty nigh across de room, t' other night,'' said Pete.
<p/>Good Lor! get him (<font color='blue'><b>Pete</b></font>) in it, then,'' said Mose, <div class="bookquote">``and den he (<font color='blue'><b>Mose</b></font>)'d begin, `Come saints--and sinners, hear me tell,' and den down he (<font color='blue'><b>Mose</b></font>)'d
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mose</b></font>)</div>go,''--and Mose imitated precisely the nasal tones of the old man, tumbling on the floor, to illustrate the supposed catastrophe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come now, be decent, can't ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Chloe; <div class="bookquote">``an't yer shamed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>Mas'r George, however, joined the offender in the laugh, and declared decidedly that Mose was a <div class="bookquote">``buster.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mose</b></font>)</div>So the maternal admonition seemed rather to fail of effect. '' Well, ole man,'' said Aunt Chloe, <div class="bookquote">``you'll have to tote in them ar bar`ls.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Mother's bar`ls is like dat ar widder's, Mas'r George was reading `bout, in de good book,--dey never fails,'' said Mose, aside to Peter.
<p/>I'm sure one on 'em caved in last week,'' said Pete, <div class="bookquote">``and let 'em all down in de middle of de singin'; dat ar was failin', warnt it?
<p/>During this aside between Mose and Pete, two empty casks had been rolled into the cabin, and being secured from rolling, by stones on each side, boards were laid across them, which arrangement, together with the turning down of certain tubs and pails, and the disposing of the rickety chairs, at last completed the preparation.
<p/>George is such a beautiful reader, now, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'ll stay to read for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Pete</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Chloe; ''`pears like 't will be so much more interestin'.
<p/>'' '' '' Mas'r '' George very readily consented, for your boy is always ready for anything that makes him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) of importance.
<p/>The room was soon filled with a motley assemblage, from the old gray-headed patriarch of eighty, to the young girl and lad of fifteen.
<p/>A little harmless gossip ensued on various themes, such as where old Aunt Sally got her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) new red headkerchief, and how <div class="bookquote">``Missis was a going to give Lizzy that spotted muslin gown, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)'d got her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) new berage made up;''  (<font color='red'><b>Sally</b></font>)</div>and how Mas'r Shelby was thinking of buying a new sorrel colt, that was going to prove an addition to the glories of the place.
<p/>A few of the worshippers belonged to families hard by, who had got permission to attend, and who brought in various choice scraps of information, about the sayings and doings at the house and on the place, which circulated as freely as the same sort of small change does in higher circles.
<p/>Not even all the disadvantage of nasal intonation could prevent the effect of the naturally fine voices, in airs at once wild and spirited.
<p/>The words were sometimes the well-known and common hymns sung in the churches about, and sometimes of a wilder, more indefinite character, picked up at camp-meetings.
<p/>After a while the singing commenced, to the evident delight of all present. The chorus of one of them, which ran as follows, was sung with great energy and unction:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Die on the field of battle, Die on the field of battle, Glory in my soul. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Another special favorite had oft repeated the words--
<p/>``O, I'm going to glory,--won't you come along with me? Don't you see the angels beck`ning, and a calling me away?
<p/>There were others, which made incessant mention of <div class="bookquote">``Jordan's banks,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Canaan's fields,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``New Jerusalem;''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>for the negro mind, impassioned and imaginative, always attaches itself to hymns and expressions of a vivid and pictorial nature; and, as they sung, some laughed, and some cried, and some clapped hands, or shook hands rejoicingly with each other, as if they had fairly gained the other side of the river.
<p/>Don't you see the golden city and the everlasting day? '' Various exhortations, or relations of experience, followed, and intermingled with the singing.
<p/>One old gray-headed woman, long past work, but much revered as a sort of chronicle of the past, rose, and leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) staff, said--<div class="bookquote">``Well,
<p/>Well, I'm mighty glad to hear ye all and see ye all once more, 'cause I don't know when I'll be gone to glory; but I've done got ready, chil`en; `pears like I'd got my little bundle all tied up, and my bonnet on, jest a waitin' for the stage to come along and take me home; sometimes, in the night, I think I hear the wheels a rattlin', and I'm lookin' out all the time; now, you jest be ready too, for I tell ye all, chil`en,''  (<font color='red'><b>staff</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said striking her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) staff hard on the floor, ``dat ar glory is a mighty thing!
<p/>And the old creature sat down, with streaming tears, as wholly overcome, while the whole circle struck up-- <div class="bookquote">``O Canaan, bright Canaan I'm bound for the land of Canaan.
<p/>chil`en! It's a mighty thing, chil`en,--you don`no nothing about it,--it's wonderful . ''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>'' Mas'r George, by request, read the last chapters of Revelation, often interrupted by such exclamations as <div class="bookquote">``The sakes now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>George, who was a bright boy, and well trained in religious things by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother, finding himself an object of general admiration, threw in expositions of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own, from time to time, with a commendable seriousness and gravity, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was admired by the young and blessed by the old; and it was agreed, on all hands, that ``a minister couldn't lay it off better than he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) did; that 't was reely `mazin'!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only hear that!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jest think on `t!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is all that a comin' sure enough? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle Tom</b></font>)</div>'' Uncle Tom was a sort of patriarch in religious matters, in the neighborhood.
<p/>Having, naturally, an organization in which the morale was strongly predominant, together with a greater breadth and cultivation of mind than obtained among his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) companions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was looked up to with great respect, as a sort of minister among them; and the simple, hearty, sincere style of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) exhortations might have edified even better educated persons.
<p/>Nothing could exceed the touching simplicity, the childlike earnestness, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prayer, enriched with the language of Scripture, which seemed so entirely to have wrought itself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) being, as to have become a part of himself, and to drop from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips unconsciously; in the language of a pious old negro, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``prayed right up.
<p/>And so much did his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prayer always work on the devotional feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) audiences, that there seemed often a danger that it would be lost altogether in the abundance of the responses which broke out everywhere around him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>While this scene was passing in the cabin of the man, one quite otherwise passed in the halls of the master.
<p/>The trader and Mr. Shelby were seated together in the dining room afore-named, at a table covered with papers and writing utensils.
<p/>Mr. Shelby was busy in counting some bundles of bills, which, as they were counted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) pushed over to the trader, who counted them likewise.
<p/>But it was in prayer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) especially excelled. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' All fair,'' said the trader; <div class="bookquote">``and now for signing these yer.
<p/>Mr. Shelby hastily drew the bills of sale towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>), and signed them, like a man that hurries over some disagreeable business, and then pushed them over with the money.
<p/>Haley produced, from a well-worn valise, a parchment, which, after looking over it a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) handed to Mr. Shelby, who took it with a gesture of suppressed eagerness.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>'' Wal, now, the thing's done !'' said the trader, getting up. '' It's done !'' said Mr. Shelby, in a musing tone; and, fetching a long breath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``It's done!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Haley,'' said Mr. Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you'll remember that you promised, on your honor, you wouldn't sell Tom, without knowing what sort of hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s going into.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>Yer don't seem to feel much pleased with it, `pears to me,'' said the trader. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, you've just done it sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>said the trader.
<p/>'' Circumstances, you well know, obliged me,'' said Shelby, haughtily. '' Wal, you know, they may `blige me , too,'' said the trader.
<p/>Howsomever, I'll do the very best I can in gettin' Tom a good berth; as to my treatin' on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bad, you needn't be a grain afeard.
<p/>After the expositions which the trader had previously given of his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) humane principles, Mr. Shelby did not feel particularly reassured by these declarations; but, as they were the best comfort the case admitted of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) allowed the trader to depart in silence, and betook himself to a solitary cigar.
<p/>'' If there's anything that I thank the Lord for, it is that I'm never noways cruel. '' CHAPTER V Showing the Feelings of Living Property on Changing
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was lounging in a large easy-chair, looking over some letters that had come in the afternoon mail, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was standing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) mirror, brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which Eliza had arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) hair; for, noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) pale cheeks and haggard eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had excused her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) attendance that night, and ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to bed.
<p/>The employment, naturally enough, suggested her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) conversation with the girl in the morning; and turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, carelessly, <div class="bookquote">``By the by, Arthur, who was that low-bred fellow that you lugged in to our dinner-table today?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Haley is his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) name,'' said Shelby, turning himself rather uneasily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) chair, and continuing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) eyes fixed on a letter.
<p/>Owners Mr. and Mrs. Shelby had retired to their apartment for the night. '' '' Haley! Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>), and what may be his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) business here, pray?''
<p/>'' Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'s a man that I transacted some business with, last time I was at Natchez,'' said Mr. Shelby. ''
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) presumed on it to make himself quite at home, and call and dine here, ay?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, I invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>); I had some accounts with him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Shelby.
<p/>'' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) a negro-trader?'' said Mrs. Shelby, noticing a certain embarrassment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) husband's manner. '' Why, my dear, what put that into your head?'' said Shelby, looking up.
<p/>Eliza came in here, after dinner, in a great worry, crying and taking on, and said you were talking with a trader, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) make an offer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) boy--the ridiculous little goose!''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) did, hey?'' said Mr. Shelby, returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) paper, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) seemed for a few moments quite intent upon, not perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was holding it bottom upwards.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I told Eliza,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Shelby, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) continued brushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) hair, <div class="bookquote">``that she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was a little fool for her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) pains, and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons.

<p/>'' I'm sorry to say that I am,'' said Mr. Shelby. '' I've agreed to sell Tom.'' <div class="bookquote">``What! our Tom?--that good, faithful creature!--been your faithful servant from a boy!
<p/>O, Mr. Shelby!--and you have promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) freedom, too,--you and I have spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) a hundred times of it.
<p/>Well, I can believe anything now,--I can believe now that you could sell little Harry, poor Eliza's only child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Shelby, in a tone between grief and indignation.
<p/>I have agreed to sell Tom and Harry both; and I don't know why I am to be rated, as if I were a monster, for doing what every one does every day.''
<p/>'' Well, since you must know all, it is so. '' But why, of all others, choose these?'' said Mrs. Shelby.
<p/>'' Why sell them, of all on the place, if you must sell at all? '' <div class="bookquote">``Because they will bring the highest sum of any,--that's why.
<p/>I could choose another, if you say so. The fellow made me a high bid on Eliza, if that would suit you any better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shelby.
<p/>'' The wretch!'' said Mrs. Shelby, vehemently. '' Well, I didn't listen to it, a moment,--out of regard to your feelings,
<p/>I wouldn't;--so give me some credit.'' '' My dear,'' said Mrs. Shelby, recollecting herself, <div class="bookquote">``forgive me. I have been hasty. I was surprised, and entirely unprepared for
<p/>this;--but surely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creatures. Tom is a noble-hearted, faithful fellow, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is black.
<p/>I do believe, Mr. Shelby, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) were put to it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) would lay down his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) life for you.''

<p/>I have cared for them, instructed them, watched over them, and know all their little cares and joys, for years; and how can I ever hold up my head again among them, if, for the sake of a little paltry gain, we sell such a faithful, excellent, confiding creature as poor Tom, and tear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in a moment all we have taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to love and value?
<p/>I have taught them the duties of the family, of parent and child, and husband and wife; and how can I bear to have this open acknowledgment that we care for no tie, no duty,
<p/>I have talked with Eliza about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) boy--her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) duty to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as a Christian mother, to watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) up in a Christian way; and now what can I say, if you tear him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) away, and sell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), soul and body, to a profane, unprincipled man, just to save a little money?
<p/>I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) that one soul is worth more than all the money in the world; and how will she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) believe me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) sees us turn round and sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child?--sell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), perhaps, to certain ruin of body and soul!''

<p/>I've raked, and scraped, and borrowed, and all but begged,--and the price of these two was needed to make up the balance, and I had to give them up.
<p/>Haley fancied the child; he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) agreed to settle the matter that way, and no other. I was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) power, and had to do it.
<p/>If you feel so to have them sold, would it be any better to have all sold? '' Mrs. Shelby stood like one stricken.
<p/>This is God's curse on slavery!--a bitter, bitter, most accursed thing!--a curse to the master and a curse to the slave!
<p/>Finally, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) toilet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) hands, and gave a sort of groan. '' I was a fool to think I could make anything good out of such a deadly evil.
<p/>always thought so when I was a girl,--I thought so still more after I joined the church; but I thought I could gild it over,--I thought, by kindness, and care, and instruction, I could make the condition of mine better than freedom--
<p/>It is a sin to hold a slave under laws like ours,--I always felt it was,--I fool that I was!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, wife, you are getting to be an abolitionist, quite.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>We don't need them to tell us; you know I never thought that slavery was right--never felt willing to own slaves.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Abolitionist! if they knew all I know about slavery, they might talk! ''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>Well, therein you differ from many wise and pious men,'' said Mr. Shelby.
<p/>'' You remember Mr. B.'s sermon, the other Sunday?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want to hear such sermons; I never wish to hear Mr. B. in our church again.
<p/>Ministers can't help the evil, perhaps,--can't cure it, any more than we can,--but defend it!--it always went against my common sense.
<p/>Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``I must say these ministers sometimes carry matters further than we poor sinners would exactly dare to do.
<p/>We men of the world must wink pretty hard at various things, and get used to a deal that isn't the exact thing.
<p/>But we don't quite fancy, when women and ministers come out broad and square, and go beyond us in matters of either modesty or morals, that's a fact.
<p/>But now, my dear, I trust you see the necessity of the thing, and you see that I have done the very best that circumstances would allow.
<p/>O yes, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Shelby, hurriedly and abstractedly fingering her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) gold watch,--<div class="bookquote">``I haven't any jewelry of any amount,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) added, thoughtfully;
<p/>And I think you didn't think much of that sermon, either. '' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``but would not this watch do something?--it was an expensive one, when it was bought.
<p/>I'm sorry, very sorry, Emily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sorry this takes hold of you so; but it will do no good.
<p/>The fact is, Emily, the thing's done; the bills of sale are already signed, and in Haley's hands; and you must be thankful it is no worse.
<p/>If I could only at least save Eliza's child, I would sacrifice anything I have. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>'' That man has had it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power to ruin us
<p/>all,--and now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is fairly off. If you knew the man as I do, you'd think that we had had a narrow escape.''
<p/>``Why, not a cruel man, exactly, but a man of leather,--a man alive to nothing but trade and profit,--cool, and unhesitating, and unrelenting, as death and the grave.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so hard, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d sell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mother at a good percentage--not wishing the old woman any harm, either.''
<p/>Well, my dear, the fact is that this goes rather hard with me; it's a thing I hate to think of.
<p/>'' And this wretch owns that good, faithful Tom, and Eliza's child!'' '' Haley wants to drive matters, and take possession tomorrow.
<p/>I'm going to get out my horse bright and early, and be off. I can't see Tom , that's a fact; and you had better arrange a drive somewhere, and carry Eliza off.
<p/>Let the thing be done when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) is out of sight.'' <div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Shelby; <div class="bookquote">``I'll be in no sense accomplice or help in this cruel business.
<p/>I'll go and see poor old Tom, God help him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) distress! They shall see, at any rate, that their mistress can feel for and with them.
<p/>As to Eliza, I dare not think about it. The Lord forgive us! What have we done, that this cruel necessity should come on us?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>There was one listener to this conversation whom Mr. and Mrs. Shelby little suspected. Communicating with their apartment was a large closet, opening by a door into the outer passage.
<p/>When Mrs. Shelby had dismissed Eliza for the night, her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) feverish and excited mind had suggested the idea of this closet; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) had hidden herself there, and, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) ear pressed close against the crack of the door, had lost not a word of the conversation.
<p/>Pale, shivering, with rigid features and compressed lips, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) looked an entirely altered being from the soft and timid creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) had been hitherto.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) moved cautiously along the entry, paused one moment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) mistress' door, and raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) hands in mute appeal to Heaven, and then turned and glided into her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) own room.
<p/>When the voices died into silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) rose and crept stealthily away. It was a quiet, neat apartment, on the same floor with her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) mistress.
<p/>There was a pleasant sunny window, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) had often sat singing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) sewing; there a little case of books, and various little fancy articles, ranged by them, the gifts of Christmas holidays; there was her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) simple wardrobe in the closet and in the drawers:--here was, in short, her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) home; and, on the whole, a happy one it had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>).
<p/>But there, on the bed, lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) slumbering boy, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) long curls falling negligently around his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) unconscious face, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rosy mouth half open, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little fat hands thrown out over the bedclothes, and a smile spread like a sunbeam over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) whole face.
<p/>No tear dropped over that pillow; in such straits as these, the heart has no tears to give,--it drops only blood, bleeding itself away in silence.
<p/>'' Poor boy! poor fellow! '' said Eliza; <div class="bookquote">``they have sold you! but your mother will save you yet! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) took a piece of paper and a pencil, and wrote, hastily, <div class="bookquote">``O, Missis!
<p/>dear Missis! don't think me ungrateful,--don't think hard of me, any way,--I heard all you and master said tonight. I am going to try to save my boy--you will not blame me!
<p/>Hastily folding and directing this, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went to a drawer and made up a little package of clothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) boy, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tied with a handkerchief firmly round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) waist; and, so fond is a mother's remembrance, that, even in the terrors of that hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not forget to put in the little package one or two of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) favorite toys, reserving a gayly painted parrot to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should be called on to awaken him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>It was some trouble to arouse the little sleeper; but, after some effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sat up, and was playing with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) bird, while his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother was putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bonnet and shawl.
<p/>God bless and reward you for all your kindness!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' Where are you going, mother? '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) drew near the bed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) little coat and cap.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother drew near, and looked so earnestly into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at once divined that something unusual was the matter.
<p/>A wicked man was coming to take little Harry away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother, and carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) `way off in the dark; but mother won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)--
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s going to put on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little boy's cap and coat, and run off with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), so the ugly man can't catch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Saying these words, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had tied and buttoned on the child's simple outfit, and, taking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be very still; and, opening a door in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) room which led into the outer verandah, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) glided noiselessly out.
<p/>It was a sparkling, frosty, starlight night, and the mother wrapped the shawl close round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child, as, perfectly quiet with vague terror, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clung round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Old Bruno, a great Newfoundland, who slept at the end of the porch, rose, with a low growl, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came near.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gently spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>) name, and the animal, an old pet and playmate of hers, instantly, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>) tail, prepared to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>playmate</b></font>), though apparently revolving much, in this simple dog's head, what such an indiscreet midnight promenade might mean.
<p/>Some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>) considerably; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>) often stopped, as Eliza glided forward, and looked wistfully, first at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) and then at the house, and then, as if reassured by reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>) pattered along after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) again.
<p/>'' Hush, Harry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``mustn't speak loud, or they will hear us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A few minutes brought them to the window of Uncle Tom's cottage, and Eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane.
<p/>The prayer-meeting at Uncle Tom's had, in the order of hymn-singing, been protracted to a very late hour; and, as Uncle Tom had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that, although it was now between twelve and one o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good Lord! what's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Chloe, starting up and hastily drawing the curtain. '' My sakes alive, if it an't Lizy!
<p/>Get on your clothes, old man, quick!--there's old Bruno, too, a pawin round; what on airth! I'm gwine to open the door.
<p/>And suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light of the tallow candle, which Tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive.
<p/>'' '' Lord bless you!--I'm skeered to look at ye, Lizy! Are ye tuck sick, or what's come over ye?'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm running away--Uncle Tom and Aunt Chloe--carrying off my child--Master sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)!'' said Eliza, firmly; ``I crept into the closet by Mistress' door tonight, and I heard Master tell Missis that he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) had sold my Harry, and you, Uncle Tom, both, to a trader; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going off this morning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) horse, and that the man was to take possession today.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay. '' '' Tom had stood, during this speech, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands raised, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes dilated, like a man in a dream.
<p/>Slowly and gradually, as its meaning came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) collapsed, rather than seated himself, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old chair, and sunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees.
<p/>'' The good Lord have pity on us!'' said Aunt Chloe. '' O! it don't seem as if it was true!
<p/>What has he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) done, that Mas'r should sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) ?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hasn't done anything,--it isn't for that. Master don't want to sell, and Missis
<p/>I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) plead and beg for us; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) 't was no use; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was in this man's debt, and that this man had got the power over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't pay him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off clear, it would end in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having to sell the place and all the people, and move off.
<p/>Yes, I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) say there was no choice between selling these two and selling all, the man was driving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so hard.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>)'s always good. Master said he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was sorry; but oh, Missis--you ought to have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) talk! If she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) an't a Christian and an angel, there never was one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) said, herself, one soul was worth more than the world; and this boy has a soul, and if I let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) be carried off, who knows what'll become of it?
<p/>I'm a wicked girl to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so; but, then, I can't help it. It must be right: but, if it an't right, the Lord forgive me, for I can't help doing it!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, old man!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Chloe, <div class="bookquote">``why don't you go, too? Will you wait to be toted down river, where they kill niggers with hard work and starving?
<p/>I'd a heap rather die than go there, any day! There's time for ye,--be off with Lizy,--you've got a pass to come and go any time.
<p/>Come, bustle up, and I'll get your things together. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>Tom slowly raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head, and looked sorrowfully but quietly around, and said, <div class="bookquote">``No, no--I an't going.
<p/>Let Eliza go--it's her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) right! I wouldn't be the one to say no--`tan't in natur for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to stay; but you heard what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said!
<p/>If I must be sold, or all the people on the place, and everything go to rack, why, let me be sold.
<p/>I s`pose I can bar it as well as any on 'em,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, while something like a sob and a sigh shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) broad, rough chest convulsively.
<p/>'' Mas'r always found me on the spot--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) always will. I never have broke trust, nor used my pass no ways contrary to my word, and I never will.
<p/>It's better for me alone to go, than to break up the place and sell all. Mas'r an't to blame, Chloe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll take care of you and the poor--
<p/>'' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned to the rough trundle bed full of little woolly heads, and broke fairly down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) leaned over the back of the chair, and covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) large hands.
<p/>Sobs, heavy, hoarse and loud, shook the chair, and great tears fell through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fingers on the floor; just such tears, sir, as you dropped into the coffin where lay your first-born son; such tears, woman, as you shed when you heard the cries of your dying babe.
<p/>And, woman, though dressed in silk and jewels, you are but a woman, and, in life's great straits and mighty griefs, ye feel but one sorrow!
<p/>And now,'' said Eliza, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) stood in the door, <div class="bookquote">``I saw my husband only this afternoon, and I little knew then what was to come.
<p/>They have pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to the very last standing place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) told me, today, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was going to run away.

<p/>You must give my love to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), if I never see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) turned away, and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) back to them for a moment, and then added, in a husky voice, <div class="bookquote">``tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be as good as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can, and try and meet me in the kingdom of heaven.''

<p/>A few last words and tears, a few simple adieus and blessings, and clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) wondering and affrighted child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) glided noiselessly away.
<p/>CHAPTER VI Discovery Mr. and Mrs. Shelby, after their protracted discussion of the night before, did not readily sink to repose, and, in consequence, slept somewhat later than usual, the ensuing morning.
<p/>'' Shut the door on him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), poor beast! He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) mustn't go with me! '' '' I wonder what keeps Eliza,'' said Mrs. Shelby, after giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) bell repeated pulls, to no purpose.
<p/>Mr. Shelby was standing before his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) dressing-glass, sharpening his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) razor; and just then the door opened, and a colored boy entered, with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shaving-water.
<p/>'' Andy,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) mistress, <div class="bookquote">``step to Eliza's door, and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) I have rung for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) three times. Poor thing!
<p/>Lizy's drawers is all open, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) things all lying every which way; and I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'s just done clared out!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress step</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) added, to herself, with a sigh. Andy soon returned, with eyes very wide in astonishment. <div class="bookquote">``Lor, Missis! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>The truth flashed upon Mr. Shelby and his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) wife at the same moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) suspected it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'s off!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' The Lord be thanked!'' said Mrs. Shelby. '' I trust she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) is.''
<p/>Haley saw that I hesitated about selling this child, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'ll think I connived at it, to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) out of the way.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wife, you talk like a fool! Really, it will be something pretty awkward for me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>) is. It touches my honor!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>There was great running and ejaculating, and opening and shutting of doors, and appearance of faces in all shades of color in different places, for about a quarter of an hour.
<p/>One person only, who might have shed some light on the matter, was entirely silent, and that was the head cook, Aunt Chloe.
<p/>Silently, and with a heavy cloud settled down over her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) once joyous face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) proceeded making out her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) breakfast biscuits, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) heard and saw nothing of the excitement around her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>).
<p/>Very soon, about a dozen young imps were roosting, like so many crows, on the verandah railings, each one determined to be the first one to apprize the strange Mas'r of his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) ill luck.
<p/>And Mr. Shelby left the room hastily. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>)'ll be rael mad, I'll be bound,'' said Andy. '' Won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) swar!'' said little black Jake.
<p/>I hearn all about it then, 'cause I got into the closet where Missis keeps the great jugs, and I hearn every word.
<p/>And Mandy, who had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mandy</b></font>) life thought of the meaning of a word she (<font color='blue'><b>Mandy</b></font>) had heard, more than a black cat, now took airs of superior wisdom, and strutted about, forgetting to state that, though actually coiled up among the jugs at the time specified, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mandy</b></font>) had been fast asleep all the time.
<p/>'' Yes, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) does swar,'' said woolly-headed Mandy. '' I hearn him (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) yesterday, at dinner. '' When, at last, Haley appeared, booted and spurred, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was saluted with the bad tidings on every hand.
<p/>The young imps on the verandah were not disappointed in their hope of hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``swar,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>which he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) did with a fluency and fervency which delighted them all amazingly, as they ducked and dodged hither and thither, to be out of the reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) riding-whip; and, all whooping off together, they tumbled, in a pile of immeasurable giggle, on the withered turf under the verandah, where they kicked up their heels and shouted to their full satisfaction.
<p/>But you ha`nt got 'em, though!'' said Andy, with a triumphant flourish, and making a string of indescribable mouths at the unfortunate trader's back, when he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) was fairly beyond hearing.
<p/>'' If I had the little devils! '' muttered Haley, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) teeth. '' '' I say now, Shelby, this yer 's a most extro`rnary business!'' said Haley, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) abruptly entered the parlor.
<p/>'' It seems that gal 's off, with her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) young un. '' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Haley, Mrs. Shelby is present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shelby.
<p/>'' I beg pardon, ma'am,'' said Haley, bowing slightly, with a still lowering brow; ``but still I say, as I said before, this yer's a sing`lar report.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``if you wish to communicate with me, you must observe something of the decorum of a gentleman.
<p/>Yes, sir; I regret to say that the young woman, excited by overhearing, or having reported to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), something of this business, has taken her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child in the night, and made off.
<p/>Is it true, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>Andy, take Mr. Haley's hat and riding-whip. Take a seat, sir. '' <div class="bookquote">``I did expect fair dealing in this matter, I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley.
<p/>'' Well, sir,'' said Mr. Shelby, turning sharply round upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>), ``what am I to understand by that remark? If any man calls my honor in question, I have but one answer for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The trader cowered at this, and in a somewhat lower tone said that <div class="bookquote">``it was plaguy hard on a fellow, that had made a fair bargain, to be gulled that way.

<p/>Moreover, I shall feel bound to give you every assistance, in the use of horses, servants, &c., in the recovery of your property.
<p/>So, in short, Haley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>), suddenly dropping from the tone of dignified coolness to his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) ordinary one of easy frankness,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``the best way for you is to keep good-natured and eat some breakfast, and we will then see what is to be done.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby now rose, and said her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) engagements would prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) being at the breakfast-table that morning; and, deputing a very respectable mulatto woman to attend to the gentlemen's coffee at the side-board, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) left the room.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' Old lady don't like your humble servant, over and above,'' said Haley, with an uneasy effort to be very familiar.
<p/>'' I am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom,'' said Mr. Shelby, dryly. '' Beg pardon; of course, only a joke, you know,'' said Haley, forcing a laugh.
<p/>'' Some jokes are less agreeable than others,'' rejoined Shelby. '' Devilish free, now I've signed those papers, cuss him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>)! '' muttered Haley to himself; <div class="bookquote">``quite grand, since yesterday!
<p/>Never did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of sensation than the report of Tom's fate among his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) compeers on the place.
<p/>It was the topic in every mouth, everywhere; and nothing was done in the house or in the field, but to discuss its probable results.
<p/>Black Sam, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was commonly called, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) being about three shades blacker than any other son of ebony on the place, was revolving the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings, with a comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own personal well-being, that would have done credit to any white patriot in Washington.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>Eliza's flight--an unprecedented event on the place--was also a great accessory in stimulating the general excitement. '' It's an ill wind dat blow
<p/>nowhar,--dat ar a fact,'' said Sam, sententiously, giving an additional hoist to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) pantaloons, and adroitly substituting a long nail in place of a missing suspender-button, with which effort of mechanical genius he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) seemed highly delighted.
<p/>'' Yes, it's an ill wind blows nowhar,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) repeated. '' Now, dar, Tom's down--wal, course der's room for some nigger to be up--and why not dis nigger?--dat's de idee.

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Halloo, Sam--O Sam! Mas'r wants you to cotch Bill and Jerry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Andy</b></font>)</div>said Andy, cutting short Sam's soliloquy. '' High! what's afoot now, young un?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You teach your granny!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, with infinite contempt; <div class="bookquote">``knowed it a heap sight sooner than you did; this nigger an't so green, now!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, anyhow, Mas'r wants Bill and Jerry geared right up; and you and I 's to go with Mas'r Haley, to look arter her (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't know, I s`pose, that Lizy's cut stick, and clared out, with her (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>) young un?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Good, now! dat's de time o' day!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam.
<p/>'' It's Sam dat's called for in dese yer times. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'s de nigger. See if I don't cotch her (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>), now; Mas`r'll see what Sam can do!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! but, Sam,''  (<font color='red'><b>Andy</b></font>)</div>said Andy, <div class="bookquote">``you'd better think twice; for Missis don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>) cotched, and she (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>)'ll be in yer wool.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Andy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``High!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) eyes. '' How you know dat?'' ``Heard her (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>) say so, my own self, dis blessed mornin', when I bring in Mas`r's shaving-water.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>) sent me to see why Lizy didn't come to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>); and when I telled her (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>) was off, she (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>) jest ris up, and ses she (<font color='blue'><b>granny</b></font>), `The Lord be praised;' and Mas`r, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) seemed rael mad, and ses he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), `Wife, you talk like a fool.'
<p/>But Lor! she (<font color='blue'><b>Wife</b></font>)'ll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) to! I knows well enough how that'll be,--it's allers best to stand Missis' side the fence, now I tell yer.
<p/>Black Sam, upon this, scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) woolly pate, which, if it did not contain very profound wisdom, still contained a great deal of a particular species much in demand among politicians of all complexions and countries, and vulgarly denominated <div class="bookquote">``knowing which side the bread is buttered;''  (<font color='red'><b>politicians</b></font>)</div>so, stopping with grave consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) again gave a hitch to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) pantaloons, which was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) regularly organized method of assisting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mental perplexities.
<p/>Sam spoke like a philosopher, emphasizing this --as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had had a large experience in different sorts of worlds, and therefore had come to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) conclusions advisedly.
<p/>'' '' Der an't no saying'--never--`bout no kind o' thing in dis yer world,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said, at last. '' Now, sartin I'd a said that Missis would a scoured the varsal world after Lizy,'' added Sam, thoughtfully.
<p/>'' So she (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would,'' said Andy; <div class="bookquote">``but can't ye see through a ladder, ye black nigger? Missis don't want dis yer

<p/>And I'll tell yer more 'n all,'' said Andy; <div class="bookquote">``I specs you'd better be making tracks for dem hosses,--mighty sudden, too,--for
<p/>Sam, upon this, began to bestir himself in real earnest, and after a while appeared, bearing down gloriously towards the house, with Bill and Jerry in a full canter, and adroitly throwing himself off before they had any idea of stopping, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jerry</b></font>) brought them up alongside of the horse-post like a tornado.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Andy</b></font>)</div>I hearn Missis `quirin' arter yer,--so you've stood foolin' long enough. '' Haley's horse, which was a skittish young colt, winced, and bounced, and pulled hard at his (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) halter.
<p/>'' Ho, ho! '' said Sam, <div class="bookquote">``skeery, ar ye? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) black visage lighted up with a curious, mischievous gleam.
<p/>'' I'll fix ye now!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). There was a large beech-tree overshadowing the place, and the small, sharp, triangular beech-nuts lay scattered thickly on the ground.
<p/>With one of these in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) fingers, Sam approached the colt, stroked and patted, and seemed apparently busy in soothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) agitation.
<p/>On pretence of adjusting the saddle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) adroitly slipped under it the sharp little nut, in such a manner that the least weight brought upon the saddle would annoy the nervous sensibilities of the animal, without leaving any perceptible graze or wound.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dar!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dar</b></font>) said, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Dar</b></font>) eyes with an approving grin; <div class="bookquote">``me fix 'em!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this moment Mrs. Shelby appeared on the balcony, beckoning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dar</b></font>).
<p/>Sam approached with as good a determination to pay court as did ever suitor after a vacant place at St. James' or Washington.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord bless you, Missis!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, <div class="bookquote">``horses won't be cotched all in a minit; they'd done clared out way down to the south pasture, and the Lord knows whar!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Why have you been loitering so, Sam? I sent Andy to tell you to hurry. '' '' Sam, how often must I tell you not to say `Lord bless you, and the Lord knows,' and such things?
<p/>It's wicked.'' <div class="bookquote">``O, Lord bless my soul! I done forgot, Missis! I won't say nothing of de sort no more. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Sam, you just have said it again. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did I? O, Lord! I mean--I didn't go fur to say it.

 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><p/>Be careful of the horses, Sam; you know Jerry was a little lame last week; don't ride them too fast .
<p/>'' Well, Sam, you are to go with Mr. Haley, to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) the road, and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>). '' Mrs. Shelby spoke the last words with a low voice, and strong emphasis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let dis child alone for dat!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, rolling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) eyes with a volume of meaning. '' Lord knows! High!
<p/>'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), suddenly catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) breath, with a ludicrous flourish of apprehension, which made his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mistress laugh, spite of herself.
<p/>Didn't say dat! '' Yes, Missis, I'll look out for de hosses!'' <div class="bookquote">``Now, Andy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) stand under the beech-trees, <div class="bookquote">``you see I wouldn't be 't
<p/>all surprised if dat ar gen`lman's crittur should gib a fling, by and by, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) comes to be a gettin' up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``High! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Andy</b></font>)</div>said Andy, with an air of instant appreciation. '' Yes, you see, Andy, Missis wants to make time,--dat ar's clar to der most
<p/>Now, you see, get all dese yer hosses loose, caperin' permiscus round dis yer lot and down to de wood dar, and I spec Mas'r won't be off in a hurry.
<p/>Yer see,'' said Sam, <div class="bookquote">``yer see, Andy, if any such thing should happen as that Mas'r Haley's horse should begin to act contrary, and cut up, you and I jist lets go of our'n to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), and we'll help him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
<p/>And Sam and Andy laid their heads back on their shoulders, and broke into a low, immoderate laugh, snapping their fingers and flourishing their heels with exquisite delight.
<p/>or`nary `bserver. I jis make a little for her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>Andy grinned. '' --oh yes!'' At this instant, Haley appeared on the verandah.
<p/>Sam and Andy, clawing for certain fragmentary palm-leaves, which they were in the habit of considering as hats, flew to the horseposts, to be ready to ``help Mas`r.
<p/>Sam's palm-leaf had been ingeniously disentangled from all pretensions to braid, as respects its brim; and the slivers starting apart, and standing upright, gave it a blazing air of freedom and defiance, quite equal to that of any Fejee chief; while the whole brim of Andy's being departed bodily, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) rapped the crown on his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) head with a dexterous thump, and looked about well pleased, as if to say, <div class="bookquote">``Who says I haven't got a hat?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Somewhat mollified by certain cups of very good coffee, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) came out smiling and talking, in tolerably restored humor. '' ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a bit of him (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>), Mas`r!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, putting Haley's rein in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) hand, and holding his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) stirrup, while Andy was untying the other two horses.
<p/>The instant Haley touched the saddle, the mettlesome creature bounded from the earth with a sudden spring, that threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) master sprawling, some feet off, on the soft, dry turf.
<p/>Sam, with frantic ejaculations, made a dive at the reins, but only succeeded in brushing the blazing palm-leaf afore-named into the horse's eyes, which by no means tended to allay the confusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) nerves.
<p/>So, with great vehemence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) overturned Sam, and, giving two or three contemptuous snorts, flourished his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) heels vigorously in the air, and was soon prancing away towards the lower end of the lawn, followed by Bill and Jerry, whom Andy had not failed to let loose, according to contract, speeding them off with various direful ejaculations.
<p/>Well, boys,'' said Haley, <div class="bookquote">``look alive now; we must lose no time.''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>And now ensued a miscellaneous scene of confusion. Sam and Andy ran and shouted,--dogs barked here
<p/>and there,--and Mike, Mose, Mandy, Fanny, and all the smaller specimens on the place, both male and female, raced, clapped hands, whooped, and shouted, with outrageous officiousness and untiring zeal.
<p/>Haley's horse, which was a white one, and very fleet and spirited, appeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto; and having for his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) coursing ground a lawn of nearly half a mile in extent, gently sloping down on every side into indefinite woodland, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) appeared to take infinite delight in seeing how near he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) could allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) pursuers to approach him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>), and then, when within a hand's breadth, whisk off with a start and a snort, like a mischievous beast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was and career far down into some alley of the wood-lot.
<p/>Nothing was further from Sam's mind than to have any one of the troop taken until such season as should seem to him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) most befitting,--and
<p/>Like the sword of Coeur De Lion, which always blazed in the front and thickest of the battle, Sam's palm-leaf was to be seen everywhere when there was the least danger that a horse could be caught; there he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would bear down full tilt, shouting, <div class="bookquote">``Now for it!
<p/>the exertions that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) made were certainly most heroic. cotch him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)! cotch him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in a way that would set everything to indiscriminate rout in a moment.
<p/>Mr. Shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the balcony, and Mrs. Shelby from her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) chamber window alternately laughed and wondered,--not without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all this confusion.
<p/>At last, about twelve o'clock, Sam appeared triumphant, mounted on Jerry, with Haley's horse by his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) side, reeking with sweat, but with flashing eyes and dilated nostrils, showing that the spirit of freedom had not yet entirely subsided.
<p/>Haley ran up and down, and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'s cotched! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) exclaimed, triumphantly. '' If 't hadn't been for me, they might a bust themselves, all on 'em; but I cotched him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lord bless us, Mas`r,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, in a tone of the deepest concern, ``and me that has been racin' and chasin' till the sweat jest pours off me!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You!''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>growled Haley, in no amiable mood. '' If it hadn't been for you, this never would have happened. '' ''
<p/>'' Well, well!'' said Haley, <div class="bookquote">``you've lost me near three hours, with your cursed nonsense. Now let's be off, and have no more fooling.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mas`r,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, in a deprecating tone, <div class="bookquote">``I believe you mean to kill us all clar, horses and all.
<p/>Here we are all just ready to drop down, and the critters all in a reek of sweat. Why, Mas'r won't think of startin' on now till arter dinner.
<p/>Mas`r's hoss wants rubben down; see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) splashed hisself; and Jerry limps too; don't think Missis would be willin' to have us start dis yer way, no how.
<p/>Lord bless you, Mas'r , we can ketch up, if we do stop. Lizy never was no great of a walker.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Shelby, who, greatly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) amusement, had overheard this conversation from the verandah, now resolved to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) part.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) came forward, and, courteously expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) concern for Haley's accident, pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) to stay to dinner, saying that the cook should bring it on the table immediately.
<p/>Thus, all things considered, Haley, with rather an equivocal grace, proceeded to the parlor, while Sam, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) eyes after him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) with unutterable meaning, proceeded gravely with the horses to the stable-yard.
<p/>did yer see him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)?'' said Sam, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had got fairly beyond the shelter of the barn, and fastened the horse to a post.
<p/>'' Did yer see him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>), Andy? '' O, Lor, if it warn't as good as a meetin', now, to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) a dancin' and kickin' and swarin' at us.
<p/>Swar away, ole fellow -LRB-says I to myself -RRB-; will yer have yer hoss now, or wait till you cotch him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?
<p/>Didn't I hear him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)? -LRB-says I-RRB-. Lor, Andy, I think I can see him (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) now. '' And Sam and Andy leaned up against the barn and laughed to their hearts' content.
<p/>'' Yer oughter seen how mad he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) looked, when I brought the hoss up. Lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'d a killed me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) durs' to; and there I was a standin' as innercent and as humble.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lor, I seed you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Andy</b></font>)</div>said Andy; <div class="bookquote">``an't you an old hoss, Sam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Andy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Rather specks I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam; <div class="bookquote">``did yer see Missis up stars at the winder?

<p/>I seed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) laughin'. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>'' I'm sure, I was racin' so, I didn't see nothing,'' said Andy. '' It's a very `portant habit, Andy; and I `commend yer to be cultivatin'

<p/>'' Andy,'' said Sam, ``you's a promisin' child, der an't no manner o' doubt. I thinks lots of yer, Andy; and I don't feel no ways ashamed to take idees from you.
<p/>We oughtenter overlook nobody, Andy, cause the smartest on us gets tripped up sometimes. And so, Andy, let's go up to the house now.
<p/>It is impossible to conceive of a human creature more wholly desolate and forlorn than Eliza, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) footsteps from Uncle Tom's cabin.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband's suffering and dangers, and the danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child, all blended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mind, with a confused and stunning sense of the risk she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was running, in leaving the only home she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had ever known, and cutting loose from the protection of a friend whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) loved and revered.
<p/>Then there was the parting from every familiar object,--the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had grown up, the trees under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had played, the groves where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had walked many an evening in happier days, by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) young husband,--everything, as it lay in the clear, frosty starlight, seemed to speak reproachfully to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) whither could she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) go from a home like that?
<p/>But stronger than all was maternal love, wrought into a paroxysm of frenzy by the near approach of a fearful danger.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) boy was old enough to have walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) side, and, in an indifferent case, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) would only have led him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) by the hand; but now the bare thought of putting him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) arms made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) shudder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) strained him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) bosom with a convulsive grasp, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) went rapidly forward.
<p/>The frosty ground creaked beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) feet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) trembled at the sound; every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood backward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) heart, and quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) footsteps.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) wondered within herself at the strength that seemed to be come upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) felt the weight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) boy as if it had been a feather, and every flutter of fear seemed to increase the supernatural power that bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) on, while from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) pale lips burst forth, in frequent ejaculations, the prayer to a Friend above--<div class="bookquote">``Lord, help!
<p/>I'll be boun' Missis'll give us an uncommon good bite, dis yer time.''  (<font color='red'><b>a Friend</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VII The Mother's Struggle Lord, save me!
<p/>If it were your Harry, mother, or your Willie, that were going to be torn from you by a brutal trader, tomorrow morning,--if you had seen the man, and heard that the papers were signed and delivered, and you had only from twelve o'clock till morning to make good your escape,--how fast could you walk?
<p/>How many miles could you make in those few brief hours, with the darling at your bosom,--the little sleepy head on your shoulder,--the small, soft arms trustingly holding on to your neck?
<p/>At first, the novelty and alarm kept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waking; but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother so hurriedly repressed every breath or sound, and so assured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were only still she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would certainly save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clung quietly round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck, only asking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found himself sinking to sleep, <div class="bookquote">``Mother, I don't need to keep awake, do I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' For the child slept. '' No, my darling; sleep, if you want to.'' '' But, mother, if I do get asleep, you won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) get me?''
<p/>'' No! so may God help me! '' said his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mother, with a paler cheek, and a brighter light in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) large dark eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, sure !''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, in a voice that startled herself; for it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to come from a spirit within
<p/>, that was no part of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and the boy dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little weary head on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shoulder, and was soon asleep.
<p/>How the touch of those warm arms, the gentle breathings that came in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck, seemed to add fire and spirit to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) movements!
<p/>It seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as if strength poured into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in electric streams, from every gentle touch and movement of the sleeping, confiding child.
<p/>Sublime is the dominion of the mind over the body, that, for a time, can make flesh and nerve impregnable, and string the sinews like steel, so that the weak become so mighty.
<p/>The boundaries of the farm, the grove, the wood-lot, passed by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dizzily, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walked on; and still she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went, leaving one familiar object after another, slacking not, pausing not, till reddening daylight found her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) many a long mile from all traces of any familiar objects upon the open highway.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had often been, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mistress, to visit some connections, in the little village of T--, not far from the Ohio river, and knew the road well.
<p/>To go thither, to escape across the Ohio river, were the first hurried outlines of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) plan of escape; beyond that, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could only hope in God.
<p/>When horses and vehicles began to move along the highway, with that alert perception peculiar to a state of excitement, and which seems to be a sort of inspiration, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) became aware that her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) headlong pace and distracted air might bring on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remark and suspicion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) therefore put the boy on the ground, and, adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dress and bonnet, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) walked on at as rapid a pace as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) thought consistent with the preservation of appearances.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little bundle she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had provided a store of cakes and apples, which she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used as expedients for quickening the speed of the child, rolling the apple some yards before them, when the boy would run with all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might after it; and this ruse, often repeated, carried them over many a half-mile.
<p/>'' You're sure , an't you, mother?'' After a while, they came to a thick patch of woodland, through which murmured a clear brook.
<p/>As the child complained of hunger and thirst, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) climbed over the fence with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); and, sitting down behind a large rock which concealed them from the road, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a breakfast out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) little package.
<p/>The boy wondered and grieved that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could not eat; and when, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tried to wedge some of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cake into her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mouth, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that the rising in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) throat would choke her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>'' No, no, Harry darling! mother can't eat till you are safe! We must go on--on--till we come to the river!''
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hurried again into the road, and again constrained herself to walk regularly and composedly forward. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was many miles past any neighborhood where she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was personally known.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should chance to meet any who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) reflected that the well-known kindness of the family would be of itself a blind to suspicion, as making it an unlikely supposition that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could be a fugitive.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was also so white as not to be known as of colored lineage, without a critical survey, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child was white also, it was much easier for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to pass on unsuspected.
<p/>On this presumption, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) stopped at noon at a neat farmhouse, to rest herself, and buy some dinner for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) child and self; for, as the danger decreased with the distance, the supernatural tension of the nervous system lessened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) found herself both weary and hungry.
<p/>The good woman, kindly and gossipping, seemed rather pleased than otherwise with having somebody come in to talk with; and accepted, without examination, Eliza's statement, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``was going on a little piece, to spend a week with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) friends,'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--all which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) hoped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) heart might prove strictly true.
<p/>An hour before sunset, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) entered the village of T--, by the Ohio river, weary and foot-sore, but still strong in heart.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) first glance was at the river, which lay, like Jordan, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) and the Canaan of liberty on the other side.
<p/>It was now early spring, and the river was swollen and turbulent; great cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid waters.
<p/>Owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the Kentucky side, the land bending far out into the water, the ice had been lodged and detained in great quantities, and the narrow channel which swept round the bend was full of ice, piled one cake over another, thus forming a temporary barrier to the descending ice, which lodged, and formed a great, undulating raft, filling up the whole river, and extending almost to the Kentucky shore.
<p/>Eliza stood, for a moment, contemplating this unfavorable aspect of things, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) saw at once must prevent the usual ferry-boat from running, and then turned into a small public house on the bank, to make a few inquiries.
<p/>The hostess, who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations over the fire, preparatory to the evening meal, stopped, with a fork in her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) hand, as Eliza's sweet and plaintive voice arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>).
<p/>'' What is it? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't there any ferry or boat, that takes people over to B--, now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) said.
<p/>Eliza's look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, inquiringly, <div class="bookquote">``May be you're wanting to get over?--anybody sick?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>No, indeed!'' said the woman; <div class="bookquote">``the boats has stopped running. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Ye seem mighty anxious?'' <div class="bookquote">``I've got a child that's very dangerous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>said Eliza.
<p/>I never heard of it till last night, and I've walked quite a piece today, in hopes to get to the ferry.
<p/>'' '' '' Well, now, that's onlucky,'' said the woman, whose motherly sympathies were much aroused; <div class="bookquote">``I'm re`lly consarned for ye.
<p/>Solomon! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) called, from the window, towards a small back building. A man, in leather apron and very dirty hands, appeared at the door.
<p/>'' I say, Sol,'' said the woman, <div class="bookquote">``is that ar man going to tote them bar`ls over tonight?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sol</b></font>) should try, if 't was any way prudent,'' said the man.
<p/>There's a man a piece down here, that's going over with some truck this evening, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) durs' to; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be in here to supper tonight, so you'd better set down and wait.
<p/>'' That's a sweet little fellow,'' added the woman, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a cake. But the child, wholly exhausted, cried with weariness.
<p/>'' Poor fellow! he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) isn't used to walking, and I've hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) on so,'' said Eliza. '' Well, take him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) into this room,'' said the woman, opening into a small bed-room, where stood a comfortable bed.
<p/>Eliza laid the weary boy upon it, and held his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands in hers till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was fast asleep. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) there was no rest.
<p/>As a fire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) bones, the thought of the pursuer urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) on; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) gazed with longing eyes on the sullen, surging waters that lay between her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) and liberty.
<p/>Though Mrs. Shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on table, yet it was soon seen, as the thing has often been seen before, that it required more than one to make a bargain.
<p/>So, although the order was fairly given out in Haley's hearing, and carried to Aunt Chloe by at least half a dozen juvenile messengers, that dignitary only gave certain very gruff snorts, and tosses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) head, and went on with every operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial manner.
<p/>For some singular reason, an impression seemed to reign among the servants generally that Missis would not be particularly disobliged by delay; and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred constantly, to retard the course of things.
<p/>One luckless wight contrived to upset the gravy; and then gravy had to be got up de novo , with due care and formality, Aunt Chloe watching and stirring with dogged precision, answering shortly, to all suggestions of haste, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) ``warn't a going to have raw gravy on the table, to help nobody's catchings.
<p/>One tumbled down with the water, and had to go to the spring for more; and another precipitated the butter into the path of events; and there was from time to time giggling news brought into the kitchen that <div class="bookquote">``Mas'r Haley was mighty oneasy, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) couldn't sit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) cheer no ways, but was a walkin' and stalkin' to the winders and through the porch.
<p/>Here we must take our leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) for the present, to follow the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) pursuers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Sarves him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) right!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Chloe, indignantly.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'ll get wus nor oneasy, one of these days, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) don't mend his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) ways. His (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) master'll be sending for him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>), and then see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'ll look!''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'ll go to torment, and no mistake,'' said little Jake. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>) desarves it!'' said Aunt Chloe, grimly; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Jake</b></font>)'s broke a many, many, many hearts,--I tell ye all!
<p/>what Mas'r George reads in Ravelations,--souls a callin' under the altar! and a callin' on the Lord for vengeance on sich!--and by and by the Lord he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll hear 'em--so he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div><p/>Aunt Chloe, who was much revered in the kitchen, was listened to with open mouth; and, the dinner being now fairly sent in, the whole kitchen was at leisure to gossip with her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>), and to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) remarks.
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) said, stopping, with a fork uplifted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) hands; <div class="bookquote">``it's like ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Sich'll be burnt up forever, and no mistake; won't ther?'' said Andy.
<p/>'' I'd be glad to see it, I'll be boun','' said little Jake. <div class="bookquote">``Chil`en!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said a voice, that made them all start.
<p/>It was Uncle Tom, who had come in, and stood listening to the conversation at the door. '' Chil`en! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'm afeard you don't know what ye're sayin'.

<p/>Lor, if the devil don't get them, what's he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) good for? '' And Aunt Chloe covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) checked apron, and began to sob in good earnest.
<p/>'' Pray for them that `spitefully use you, the good book says,'' says Tom. '' Pray for 'em!'' said Aunt Chloe; <div class="bookquote">``Lor, it's too tough!
<p/>the Lord's grace is stronger; besides, you oughter think what an awful state a poor crittur's soul 's in that'll do them
<p/>I can't pray for 'em.''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>'' It's natur, Chloe, and natur 's strong,'' said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``but ar things,--you oughter thank God that you an't like him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), Chloe.
<p/>I'm sure I'd rather be sold, ten thousand times over, than to have all that ar poor crittur's got to answer for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/>'' So 'd I, a heap,'' said Jake. '' Lor, shouldn't we cotch it, Andy?'' Andy shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) shoulders, and gave an acquiescent whistle.
<p/>I'm glad Mas'r didn't go off this morning, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) looked to,'' said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``that ar hurt me more than sellin', it did.

<p/>Mas'r couldn't help hisself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) did right, but I'm feared things will be kinder goin' to rack, when I'm gone Mas'r can't be spected to be a pryin' round everywhar, as I've done, a keepin' up all the ends.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>The boys all means well, but they 's powerful car`less. That ar troubles me. '' The bell here rang, and Tom was summoned to the parlor.

Thar,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), `Tom, that's to be your young Mas`r; take good care on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),' says she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Mr. Shelby was fairly overcome, and the tears rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) eyes.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lor, yes, for that matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>said the trader, <div class="bookquote">``I may bring him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) up in a year, not much the wuss for wear, and trade him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll trade with you then, and make it for your advantage,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Shelby. '' Of course,'' said the trader, <div class="bookquote">``all 's equal with me; li`ves trade 'em up as down
<p/>, so I does a good business. All I want is a livin', you know, ma'am ; that's all any on us wants, I, s`pose.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Shelby both felt annoyed and degraded by the familiar impudence of the trader, and yet both saw the absolute necessity of putting a constraint on their feelings.
<p/>The more hopelessly sordid and insensible he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) appeared, the greater became Mrs. Shelby's dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) succeeding in recapturing Eliza and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child, and of course the greater her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) motive for detaining him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) by every female artifice.
<p/>At two o'clock Sam and Andy brought the horses up to the posts, apparently greatly refreshed and invigorated by the scamper of the morning.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) therefore graciously smiled, assented, chatted familiarly, and did all she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) could to make time pass imperceptibly. Sam was there new oiled from dinner, with an abundance of zealous and ready officiousness.
<p/>As Haley approached, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was boasting, in flourishing style, to Andy, of the evident and eminent success of the operation, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``farly come to it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Your master, I s`pose, don't keep no dogs,'' said Haley, thoughtfully, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) prepared to mount. '' Heaps on 'em,'' said Sam, triumphantly; ``thar's Bruno--he (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>)'s a roarer!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>) said something else, too, with regard to the said dogs, at which Sam muttered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't see no use cussin' on 'em, no way.
<p/>and, besides that, `bout every nigger of us keeps a pup of some natur or uther.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley,--and '' ''
<p/>But your master don't keep no dogs -LRB-I pretty much know he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) don't-RRB- for trackin' out niggers. '' Sam knew exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) meant, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) kept on a look of earnest and desperate simplicity.
<p/>'' Our dogs all smells round considable sharp. I spect they's the kind, though they han't never had no practice. They 's far dogs, though, at most anything, if you'd get 'em started.
<p/>Here, Bruno,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>) called, whistling to the lumbering Newfoundland, who came pitching tumultuously toward them. '' You go hang!'' said Haley, getting up.
<p/>Sam tumbled up accordingly, dexterously contriving to tickle Andy as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) did so, which occasioned Andy to split out into a laugh, greatly to Haley's indignation, who made a cut at him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) riding-whip.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, tumble up now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I 's `stonished at yer, Andy,'' said Sam, with awful gravity. '' This yer's a seris bisness, Andy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall take the straight road to the river,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, decidedly, after they had come to the boundaries of the estate.
<p/>Yer mustn't be a makin' game. This yer an't no way to help Mas`r.'' '' I know the way of all of 'em,--they makes tracks for the underground.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sartin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, <div class="bookquote">``dat's de idee. Mas'r Haley hits de thing right in de middle. Now, der's two roads to de river,--de dirt road and der pike,--which Mas'r mean to take?
<p/>Andy looked up innocently at Sam, surprised at hearing this new geographical fact, but instantly confirmed what he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) said, by a vehement reiteration.
<p/>Cause,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, <div class="bookquote">``I'd rather be `clined to `magine that Lizy 'd take de dirt road, bein' it's the least travelled.
<p/>Haley, notwithstanding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was a very old bird, and naturally inclined to be suspicious of chaff, was rather brought up by this view of the case.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' If yer warn't both on yer such cussed liars, now! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) said, contemplatively as he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) pondered a moment.
<p/>The pensive, reflective tone in which this was spoken appeared to amuse Andy prodigiously, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) drew a little behind, and shook so as apparently to run a great risk of failing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) horse, while Sam's face was immovably composed into the most doleful gravity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Course,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, <div class="bookquote">``Mas'r can do as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'d ruther, go de straight road, if Mas'r thinks best,--it's all one to us.
<p/>Now, when I study `pon it, I think de straight road de best, deridedly .''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) would naturally go a lonesome way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, thinking aloud, and not minding Sam's remark.
<p/>'' Dar an't no sayin','' said Sam; <div class="bookquote">``gals is pecular; they never does nothin' ye thinks they will; mose gen`lly the contrary.
<p/>Gals is nat`lly made contrary; and so, if you thinks they've gone one road, it is sartin you'd better go t' other, and then you'll be sure to find 'em.
<p/>This profound generic view of the female sex did not seem to dispose Haley particularly to the straight road, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) announced decidedly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) should go the other, and asked Sam when they should come to it.
<p/>A little piece ahead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, giving a wink to Andy with the eye which was on Andy's side of the head; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) added, gravely, <div class="bookquote">``but
<p/>Now, my private `pinion is, Lizy took der road; so I think we'd better take de straight one. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' I've studded on de matter, and I'm quite clar
<p/>we ought not to go dat ar way. I nebber been over it no way. It's despit lonesome, and we might lose our way,--whar
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now I think on `t, I think I hearn 'em tell that dat ar road was all fenced up and down by der creek, and thar, an't
<p/>we'd come to, de Lord only knows. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>'' Nevertheless,'' said Haley, <div class="bookquote">``I shall go that way.''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>it, Andy? '' Andy wasn't certain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>)'d only <div class="bookquote">``hearn tell''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>about that road, but never been over it.
<p/>Haley, accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities between lies of greater or lesser magnitude, thought that it lay in favor of the dirt road aforesaid.
<p/>The mention of the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) perceived was involuntary on Sam's part at first, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) confused attempts to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)
<p/>In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was strictly noncommittal. he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) set down to a desperate lying on second thoughts, as being unwilling to implicate Liza.
<p/>Now, the road, in fact, was an old one, that had formerly been a thoroughfare to the river, but abandoned for many years after the laying of the new pike.
<p/>When, therefore, Sam indicated the road, Haley plunged briskly into it, followed by Sam and Andy. It was open for about an hour's ride, and after that it was cut across by various farms and fences.
<p/>Sam knew this fact perfectly well,--indeed, the road had been so long closed up, that Andy had never heard of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) therefore rode along with an air of dutiful submission, only groaning and vociferating occasionally that 't was <div class="bookquote">``desp't rough, and bad for Jerry's foot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, I jest give yer warning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, <div class="bookquote">``I know yer ; yer won't get me to turn off this road, with all yer fussin'--so you shet up!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mas'r will go his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) own way!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, with rueful submission, at the same time winking most portentously to Andy, whose delight was now very near the explosive point.
<p/>Sam was in wonderful spirits,--professed to keep a very brisk lookout,--at one time exclaiming that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) saw <div class="bookquote">``a gal's bonnet''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on the top of some distant eminence, or calling to Andy <div class="bookquote">``if that thar wasn't `Lizy' down in the hollow;''  (<font color='red'><b>Andy</b></font>)</div>always making these exclamations in some rough or craggy part of the road, where the sudden quickening of speed was a special inconvenience to all parties concerned, and thus keeping Haley in a state of constant commotion.
<p/>After riding about an hour in this way, the whole party made a precipitate and tumultuous descent into a barn-yard belonging to a large farming establishment.
<p/>Not a soul was in sight, all the hands being employed in the fields; but, as the barn stood conspicuously and plainly square across the road, it was evident that their journey in that direction had reached a decided finale.
<p/>'' Wan't dat ar what I telled Mas`r? '' said Sam, with an air of injured innocence. '' How does strange gentleman spect to know more about a country dan de natives born and raised?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You rascal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, <div class="bookquote">``you knew all about this.''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Didn't I tell yer I knowd , and yer wouldn't believe me?
<p/>I telled Mas'r 't was all shet up, and fenced up, and I didn't spect we could get through,--Andy heard me.
<p/>It was all too true to be disputed, and the unlucky man had to pocket his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrath with the best grace he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was able, and all three faced to the right about, and took up their line of march for the highway.
<p/>In consequence of all the various delays, it was about three-quarters of an hour after Eliza had laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child to sleep in the village tavern that the party came riding into the same place.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>Eliza was standing by the window, looking out in another direction, when Sam's quick eye caught a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
<p/>At this crisis, Sam contrived to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) hat blown off, and uttered a loud and characteristic ejaculation, which startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) at once; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) drew suddenly back; the whole train swept by the window, round to the front door.
<p/>Haley and Andy were two yards behind. A thousand lives seemed to be concentrated in that one moment to Eliza. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) room opened by a side door to the river.
<p/>The trader caught a full glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was disappearing down the bank; and throwing himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) horse, and calling loudly on Sam and Andy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) was after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) like a hound after a deer.
<p/>In that dizzy moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) feet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) scarce seemed to touch the ground, and a moment brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to the water's edge.
<p/>Right on behind they came; and, nerved with strength such as God gives only to the desperate, with one wild cry and flying leap, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) vaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore, on to the raft of ice beyond.
<p/>It was a desperate leap--impossible to anything but madness and despair; and Haley, Sam, and Andy, instinctively cried out, and lifted up their hands, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) did it.
<p/>The huge green fragment of ice on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) alighted pitched and creaked as her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) weight came on it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) staid there not a moment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child, and sprang down the steps towards it. With wild cries and desperate energy she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) leaped to another and still another cake; stumbling--leaping--slipping--springing upwards again!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) shoes are gone--her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) stockings cut from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) feet--while blood marked every step; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) saw nothing, felt nothing, till dimly, as in a dream, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) saw the Ohio side, and a man helping her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) up the bank.
<p/>'' Yer a brave gal, now, whoever ye ar! '' said the man, with an oath. Eliza recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) old home.
<p/>'' O, Mr. Symmes!--save me--do save me--do hide me!'' said Elia. '' Why, what's this?'' said the man. '' Why, if `tan't Shelby's gal!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My child!--this boy!--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d sold him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)! There is his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Mas`r,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>), pointing to the Kentucky shore. '' O, Mr. Symmes, you've got a little boy!''
<p/>'' So I have,'' said the man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) roughly, but kindly, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) up the steep bank. '' Besides, you're a right brave gal.
<p/>I like grit, wherever I see it. '' When they had gained the top of the bank, the man paused. ''
<p/>The best I can do is to tell ye to go thar ,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), pointing to a large white house which stood by itself, off the main street of the village.
<p/>I'd be glad to do something for ye,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but then there's nowhar I could take ye. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Go thar; they're kind folks.
<p/>Thar's no kind o' danger but they'll help you,--they're up to all that sort o' thing.'' '' The Lord bless you!'' said Eliza, earnestly.
<p/>'' No `casion, no `casion in the world,'' said the man. '' What I've done's of no `count.'' '' And, oh, surely, sir, you won't tell any one!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to thunder, gal! What do you take a feller for? In course not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. '' Come, now, go along like a likely, sensible gal, as you are.
<p/>You've arnt your liberty, and you shall have it, for all me. '' The woman folded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom, and walked firmly and swiftly away.
<p/>The man stood and looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). '' Shelby, now, mebbe won't think this yer the most neighborly thing in the world; but what's a feller to do?
<p/>Somehow I never could see no kind o' critter a strivin' and pantin', and trying to clar theirselves, with the dogs arter 'em and go agin 'em.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) catches one of my gals in the same fix, he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>)'s welcome to pay back. Besides, I don't see no kind of `casion for me to be hunter and catcher for other folks, neither.
<p/>So spoke this poor, heathenish Kentuckian, who had not been instructed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kentuckian</b></font>) constitutional relations, and consequently was betrayed into acting in a sort of Christianized manner, which, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kentuckian</b></font>) had been better situated and more enlightened, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kentuckian</b></font>) would not have been left to do.
<p/>Haley had stood a perfectly amazed spectator of the scene, till Eliza had disappeared up the bank, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) turned a blank, inquiring look on Sam and Andy.
<p/>'' '' That ar was a tolable fair stroke of business,'' said Sam. '' The gal 's got seven devils in her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>), I believe!'' said Haley.
<p/>'' How like a wildcat she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) jumped!'' <div class="bookquote">``Wal, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">``I hope Mas`r'll `scuse us trying dat ar road.
<p/>Don't think I feel spry enough for dat ar, no way!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>and Sam gave a hoarse chuckle. '' You laugh!'' said the trader, with a growl.
<p/>Lord bless you, Mas`r, I couldn't help it now,'' said Sam, giving way to the long pent-up delight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) soul.
<p/>'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) looked so curi's, a leapin' and springin'--ice a crackin'--and only to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>),--plump! ker chunk! ker splash! Spring!
<p/>Lord! how she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) goes it!'' and Sam and Andy laughed till the tears rolled down their cheeks. '' I'll make ye laugh t' other side
<p/>yer mouths! '' said the trader, laying about their heads with his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) riding-whip. Both ducked, and ran shouting up the bank, and were on their horses before he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) was up.
<p/>'' Good-evening, Mas`r! '' said Sam, with much gravity. '' I berry much spect Missis be anxious `bout Jerry. Mas'r Haley won't want us no longer.
<p/>Missis wouldn't hear of our ridin' the critters over Lizy's bridge tonight;'' and, with a facetious poke into Andy's ribs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) started off, followed by the latter, at full speed,--their shouts of laughter coming faintly on the wind.
<p/>The gray mist of evening, rising slowly from the river, enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) disappeared up the bank, and the swollen current and floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) pursuer.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII Eliza's Escape Eliza made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk of twilight. Haley therefore slowly and discontentedly returned to the little tavern, to ponder further what was to be done.
<p/>The woman opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) the door of a little parlor, covered with a rag carpet, where stood a table with a very shining black oil-cloth, sundry lank, high-backed wood chairs, with some plaster images in resplendent colors on the mantel-shelf, above a very dimly-smoking grate; a long hard-wood settle extended its uneasy length by the chimney, and here Haley sat him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) down to meditate on the instability of human hopes and happiness in general.
<p/>What did I want with the little cuss, now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) said to himself, <div class="bookquote">``that I should have got myself treed like a coon, as I am, this yer way?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and Haley relieved himself by repeating over a not very select litany of imprecations on himself, which, though there was the best possible reason to consider them as true, we shall, as a matter of taste, omit.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was startled by the loud and dissonant voice of a man who was apparently dismounting at the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) hurried to the window.
<p/>'' By the land! if this yer an't the nearest, now, to what I've heard folks call Providence,'' said Haley. ''
<p/>Standing by the bar, in the corner of the room, was a brawny, muscular man, full six feet in height, and broad in proportion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dressed in a coat of buffalo-skin, made with the hair outward, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a shaggy and fierce appearance, perfectly in keeping with the whole air of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) physiognomy.
<p/>In the head and face every organ and lineament expressive of brutal and unhesitating violence was in a state of the highest possible development.
<p/>Indeed, could our readers fancy a bull-dog come unto man's estate, and walking about in a hat and coat, they would have no unapt idea of the general style and effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) physique.
<p/>I do b`lieve that ar's Tom Loker. '' Haley hastened out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was accompanied by a travelling companion, in many respects an exact contrast to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was short and slender, lithe and catlike in his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) motions, and had a peering, mousing expression about his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) keen black eyes, with which every feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) face seemed sharpened into sympathy; his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) thin, long nose, ran out as if it was eager to bore into the nature of things in general; his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) sleek, thin, black hair was stuck eagerly forward, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) motions and evolutions expressed a dry, cautious acuteness.
<p/>The little man stood tiptoe, and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head first to one side and then the other, and snuffing considerately in the directions of the various bottles, ordered at last a mint julep, in a thin and quivering voice, and with an air of great circumspection.
<p/>When poured out, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took it and looked at it with a sharp, complacent air, like a man who thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done about the right thing, and hit the nail on the head, and proceeded to dispose of it in short and well-advised sips.
<p/>The great man poured out a big tumbler half full of raw spirits, and gulped it down without a word. ''
<p/>Wal, now, who'd a thought this yer luck `ad come to me? Why, Loker, how are ye?'' said Haley, coming forward, and extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) hand to the big man.
<p/>The mousing man, who bore the name of Marks, instantly stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sipping, and, poking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head forward, looked shrewdly on the new acquaintance, as a cat sometimes looks at a moving dry leaf, or some other possible object of pursuit.
<p/>'' The devil!'' was the civil reply. '' What brought you here, Haley? '' '' I say, Tom, this yer's the luckiest thing in the world.
<p/>I'm in a devil of a hobble, and you must help me out.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ugh? aw! like enough!''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div>grunted his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) complacent acquaintance.
<p/>A body may be pretty sure of that, when you're glad to see 'em; something to be made off of 'em.
<p/>'' What's the blow now?'' '' You've got a friend here?'' said Haley, looking doubtfully at Marks; <div class="bookquote">``partner, perhaps?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marks</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have.
<p/>Here, Marks! here's that ar feller that I was in with in Natchez. ''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div>'' Shall be pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) acquaintance,'' said Marks, thrusting out a long, thin hand, like a raven's claw.
<p/>And now, gentlemen, seein' as we've met so happily, I think I'll stand up to a small matter of a treat in this here parlor.
<p/>So, now, old coon,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) to the man at the bar, <div class="bookquote">``get us hot water, and sugar, and cigars, and plenty of the real stuff
<p/>Behold, then, the candles lighted, the fire stimulated to the burning point in the grate, and our three worthies seated round a table, well spread with all the accessories to good fellowship enumerated before.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man water sugar cigars</b></font>)</div>Mr. Haley, I believe?'' '' The same, sir,'' said Haley. '' and we'll have a blow-out. '' Haley began a pathetic recital of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) peculiar troubles.
<p/>Marks, who was anxiously and with much fidgeting compounding a tumbler of punch to his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) own peculiar taste, occasionally looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) employment, and, poking his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) sharp nose and chin almost into Haley's face, gave the most earnest heed to the whole narrative.
<p/>The conclusion of it appeared to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) extremely, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) shoulders and sides in silence, and perked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) thin lips with an air of great internal enjoyment.
<p/>Loker shut up his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) mouth, and listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) with gruff and surly attention. '' So, then, ye'r fairly sewed up, an't ye?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)! It's neatly done, too.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' This yer young-un business makes lots of trouble in the trade,'' said Haley, dolefully.
<p/>'' If we could get a breed of gals that didn't care, now, for their young uns,'' said Marks; <div class="bookquote">``tell ye
<p/>, I think 't would be `bout the greatest mod`rn improvement I knows on,'' (<font color='red'><b>Marks</b></font>)</div>--and Marks patronized his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) joke by a quiet introductory sniggle.
<p/>'' Jes so,'' said Haley; <div class="bookquote">``I never couldn't see into it; young uns is heaps of trouble to 'em ; one would think, now, they'd be glad to get clar on 'em; but they arn't.
<p/>And the more trouble a young un is, and the more good for nothing, as a gen'l thing, the tighter they sticks to 'em.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wal, Mr. Haley,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marks</b></font>)</div>said Marks, ''`est pass the hot water. Yes, sir, you say `est what I feel and all`us have.
<p/>Now, I bought a gal once, when I was in the trade,--a tight, likely wench she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) was, too, and quite considerable
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) had a young un that was mis`able sickly; it had a crooked back, or something or other; and I jest gin 't away to a man that thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chance raising on `t, being it didn't cost nothin';--never thought, yer know, of the gal's takin' on about it,--but, Lord, yer oughter seen how she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) went on.
<p/>Why, re`lly, she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) did seem to me to valley the child more 'cause 't was sickly and cross, and plagued her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) warn't making b`lieve, neither,--cried about it, she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) did, and lopped round, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)'d lost every friend she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) had.
<p/>smart,--and It re`lly was droll to think on ' t. Lord, there ain't no end to women's notions. '' <div class="bookquote">``Wal, jest so with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley.
<p/>Last summer, down on Red River, I got a gal traded off on me, with a likely lookin' child enough, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) eyes looked as bright as yourn; but, come to look, I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) stone blind.
<p/>'' Fact--he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was stone blind. Wal, ye see, I thought there warn't no harm in my jest passing him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) along, and not sayin' nothin';
<p/>and I'd got him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) nicely swapped off for a keg o' whiskey; but come to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) away from the gal
<p/>So 't was before we started, and I hadn't got my gang chained up; so what should she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) do but ups on a cotton-bale, like a cat, ketches a knife from one of the deck hands, and,
<p/>I tell ye, she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) made all fly for a minit, till she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) saw 't wan't no use; and she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) jest turns round, and pitches head first, young un and all, into the river,--went down plump, and never ris.''
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) was jest like a tiger. <div class="bookquote">``Bah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom Loker, who had listened to these stories with ill-repressed disgust,--<div class="bookquote">``shif`less, both on ye!

<p/>I makes 'em as whist as fishes; and if one on 'em begins and gives a yelp, why,--''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>and Mr. Loker brought down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) fist with a thump that fully explained the hiatus.
<p/>That ar's what ye may call emphasis ,'' said Marks, poking Haley in the side, and going into another small giggle.
<p/>I tell ye, they sees it an't no play, when I gets hold. '' '' An't Tom peculiar? he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)! I say, Tom, I s`pect you make 'em understand , for all niggers' heads is woolly.

<p/>Tom received the compliment with becoming modesty, and began to look as affable as was consistent, as John Bunyan says, <div class="bookquote">``with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunyan</b></font>) doggish nature.
<p/>Haley, who had been imbibing very freely of the staple of the evening, began to feel a sensible elevation and enlargement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) moral faculties,--a phenomenon not unusual with gentlemen of a serious and reflective turn, under similar circumstances.

<p/>And your `gettin' religion,' as you call it, arter all, is too p`isin mean for any crittur;--run up a bill with the devil all your life, and then sneak out when pay time comes!

<p/>Mr. Haley is a very nice man, no doubt, and has his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) own conscience; and, Tom, you have your ways, and very good ones, too, Tom; but quarrelling, you know, won't answer no kind of purpose.
<p/>'' There's different ways, you know, of looking at all subjects. Let's go to business. Now, Mr. Haley, what is it?--you want us to undertake to catch this yer gal?''
<p/>'' The gal's no matter of mine,--she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)'s Shelby's ; it's only the boy. I was a fool for buying the monkey!''
<p/>Come, now, Loker, none of your huffs,'' said Marks, licking his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) lips; <div class="bookquote">``you see, Mr. Haley 's a puttin' us in a way of a good job, I reckon; just hold still--these yer arrangements is my forte.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marks</b></font>)</div>You're generally a fool!'' said Tom, gruffly. '' This yer gal, Mr. Haley , how is she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)? what is she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>)?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wal! white and handsome--well brought up. I'd a gin Shelby eight hundred or a thousand, and then made well on her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>White</b></font>)</div><p/>'' White and handsome--well brought up!'' said Marks, his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) sharp eyes, nose and mouth, all alive with enterprise. '' Look here, now, Loker, a beautiful opening.
<p/>We'll do a business here on our own account;--we does the catchin'; the boy, of course, goes to Mr. Haley,--we takes the gal to Orleans to speculate on.
<p/>Tom, whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication, now suddenly snapped it together, as a big dog closes on a piece of meat, and seemed to be digesting the idea at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) leisure. ''
<p/>Ye see,'' said Marks to Haley, stirring his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) punch as he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) did so, <div class="bookquote">``ye see, we has justices convenient at all p`ints along shore, that does up any little jobs in our line quite reasonable.

<p/>Sometimes I rather wish they was more particular; 't would be a heap more relishin' if they was,--more fun, yer know.
<p/>Tom Loker, who, as we have made it appear, was a man of slow thoughts and movements, here interrupted Marks by bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heavy fist down on the table, so as to make all ring again, <div class="bookquote">``It'll do!

<p/>Marks had got from his (<font color='blue'><b>Belcher</b></font>) pocket a greasy pocket-book, and taking a long paper from thence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Belcher</b></font>) sat down, and fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Belcher</b></font>) keen black eyes on it, began mumbling over its contents: <div class="bookquote">``Barnes--Shelby County--boy Jim, three hundred dollars for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), dead or alive.

<p/>I'll manage that ar; they 's young in the business, and must spect to work cheap,'' said Marks, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) continued to read.
<p/>Ther's three on 'em easy cases, 'cause all you've got to do is to shoot 'em, or swear they is shot; they couldn't, of course, charge much for that.
<p/>'' '' Them other cases,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, folding the paper, <div class="bookquote">``will bear puttin' off a spell. So now let's come to the particulars.

<p/>'' The ice is running awfully, Tom; an't it dangerous?'' <div class="bookquote">``Don`no nothing `bout that,--only it's got to be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, decidedly.
<p/>Dear me,'' said Marks, fidgeting, <div class="bookquote">``it'll be--I say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marks</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, walking to the window, <div class="bookquote">``it's dark as a wolf's mouth, and, Tom--
<p/>Suppose you want to lie by a day or two, till the gal 's been carried on the underground line up to Sandusky or so, before you start.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' ``The long and short is, you're scared, Marks; but I can't help that,--you've got to go. <div class="bookquote">``O, no; I an't a grain afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marks</b></font>)</div>said Marks, ``only--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard the woman say there was one coming along this evening, and that a man was going to cross over in it.

<p/>'' I s`pose you've got good dogs,'' said Haley. '' First rate,'' said Marks. '' But what's the use? you han't got nothin' o' hers to smell on.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, triumphantly. '' Here's her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) shawl she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) left on the bed in her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) hurry; she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) bonnet, too.''

<p/>'' That ar's a consideration,'' said Marks. '' Our dogs tore a feller half to pieces, once, down in Mobile, `fore we could get 'em off.''
<p/>'' Well, ye see, for this sort that's to be sold for their looks , that ar won't answer, ye see,'' said Haley.
<p/>Dogs is no `count in these yer up states where these critters gets carried; of course, ye can't get on their track.
<p/>They only does down in plantations, where niggers, when they runs, has to do their own running, and don't get no help.
<p/>Well,'' said Loker, who had just stepped out to the bar to make some inquiries, <div class="bookquote">``they say the man's come with the boat; so, Marks--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That worthy cast a rueful look at the comfortable quarters he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was leaving, but slowly rose to obey.
<p/>After exchanging a few words of further arrangement, Haley, with visible reluctance, handed over the fifty dollars to Tom, and the worthy trio separated for the night.
<p/>If any of our refined and Christian readers object to the society into which this scene introduces them, let us beg them to begin and conquer their prejudices in time.
<p/>'' I do see,'' said Marks. '' Besides, if she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)'s got took in, `tan't no go, neither. '' '' The catching business, we beg to remind them, is rising to the dignity of a lawful and patriotic profession.
<p/>If all the broad land between the Mississippi and the Pacific becomes one great market for bodies and souls, and human property retains the locomotive tendencies of this nineteenth century, the trader and catcher may yet be among our aristocracy.
<p/>While this scene was going on at the tavern, Sam and Andy, in a state of high felicitation, pursued their way home.
<p/>Sam was in the highest possible feather, and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) exultation by all sorts of supernatural howls and ejaculations, by divers odd motions and contortions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) whole system.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would sit backward, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) face to the horse's tail and sides, and then, with a whoop and a somerset, come right side up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) place again, and, drawing on a grave face, begin to lecture Andy in high-sounding tones for laughing and playing the fool.
<p/>Anon, slapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) sides with his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) would burst forth in peals of laughter, that made the old woods ring as they passed.
<p/>With all these evolutions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) contrived to keep the horses up to the top of their speed, until, between ten and eleven, their heels resounded on the gravel at the end of the balcony.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby flew to the railings. '' Is that you, Sam? Where are they?'' '' Mas'r Haley 's a-restin' at the tavern
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'s drefful fatigued, Missis.'' <div class="bookquote">``And Eliza, Sam?''  (<font color='red'><b>Wal</b></font>)</div>'' Wal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)'s clar `cross Jordan. As a body may say, in the land o' Canaan.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Sam, what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Shelby, breathless, and almost faint, as the possible meaning of these words came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>).
<p/>Lizy's done gone over the river into `Hio, as `markably as if de Lord took her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) over in a charrit of fire and two hosses.
<p/>Sam's vein of piety was always uncommonly fervent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mistress' presence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) made great capital of scriptural figures and images.
<p/>Come up here, Sam,'' said Mr. Shelby, who had followed on to the verandah, <div class="bookquote">``and tell your mistress what she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) wants.
<p/>Come, come, Emily,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>), passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you are cold and all in a shiver; you allow yourself to feel too much.''

'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Feel too much! Am not I a woman,--a mother? Are we not both responsible to God for this poor girl?
<p/>My God! lay not this sin to our charge.''  (<font color='red'><b>Emily</b></font>)</div>'' What sin, Emily? You see yourself that we have only done what we were obliged to.''
<p/>'' There's an awful feeling of guilt about it, though,'' said Mrs. Shelby. '' I can't reason it away. '' <div class="bookquote">``Here, Andy, you nigger, be alive!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>called Sam, under the verandah; <div class="bookquote">``take these yer hosses to der barn; don't ye hear Mas'r a callin'? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>and Sam soon appeared, palm-leaf in hand, at the parlor door.
<p/>'' Now, Sam, tell us distinctly how the matter was,'' said Mr. Shelby. '' Where is Eliza, if you know?'' <div class="bookquote">``Wal, Mas`r, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), with my own eyes, a crossin' on the floatin' ice.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) crossed most `markably; it wasn't no less nor a miracle; and I saw a man help her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) up the `Hio side, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was lost in the dusk.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Sam, I think this rather apocryphal,--this miracle. Crossing on floating ice isn't so easily done,'' said Mr. Shelby. '' Easy! couldn't nobody a done it, without de Lord.
<p/>Mas'r Haley, and me, and Andy, we comes up to de little tavern by the river, and I rides a leetle
<p/>Why, now,'' said Sam, '''t was jist dis yer way. ahead,---LRB-I's so zealous to be a cotchin' Lizy, that I couldn't hold in, no way-RRB-,--and when I comes by the tavern winder,

<p/>Lizy she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hars, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) dodges back, when Mas'r Haley he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) goes past the door; and then, I tell ye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) clared out de side door; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) went down de river
<p/>Down she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) come to the river, and thar was the current running ten feet wide by the shore, and over t' other side ice a sawin' and

<p/>We come right behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and I thought my soul he (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>)'d got her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sure enough,--when went crack! c`wallop! cracking! chunk! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) a boundin' like a buck!
<p/>Lord, the spring that ar gal's got in her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) an't common, I'm o' `pinion. '' Mrs. Shelby sat perfectly silent, pale with excitement, while Sam told his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) story.
<p/>'' God be praised, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) isn't dead! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but where is the poor child now?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' De Lord will pervide,'' said Sam, rolling up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) eyes piously.
<p/>'' As I've been a sayin', dis yer 's a providence and no mistake, as Missis has allers been a instructin' on us.
<p/>Thar's allers instruments ris up to do de Lord's will. Now, if 't hadn't been for me today, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>)'d a been took a dozen times.
<p/>Warn't it I started off de hosses, dis yer mornin' and kept 'em chasin' till nigh dinner time? And didn't I car
<p/>Mas'r Haley night five miles out of de road, dis evening, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'d a come up with Lizy as easy as a dog arter a coon.
<p/>These yer 's all providences. '' '' They are a kind of providences that you'll have to be pretty sparing of, Master Sam.
<p/>I allow no such practices with gentlemen on my place,'' said Mr. Shelby, with as much sternness as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) could command, under the circumstances.
<p/>Now, there is no more use in making believe be angry with a negro than with a child; both instinctively see the true state of the case, through all attempts to affect the contrary; and Sam was in no wise disheartened by this rebuke, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) assumed an air of doleful gravity, and stood with the corners of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) mouth lowered in most penitential style.
<p/>'' Mas'r quite right,--quite ; it was ugly on me,--there's no disputin' that ar; and of course Mas'r and Missis wouldn't encourage no such works.
<p/>I'm sensible of dat ar; but a poor nigger like me 's `mazin' tempted to act ugly sometimes, when fellers will cut up such shines as dat ar Mas'r Haley
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) an't no gen`l'man no way; anybody's been raised as I've been can't help a seein' dat ar. '' ''
<p/>Well, Sam,'' said Mrs. Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``as you appear to have a proper sense of your errors, you may go now and tell Aunt Chloe she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) may get you some of that cold ham that was left of dinner today.
<p/>You and Andy must be hungry.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Missis is a heap too good for us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div>said Sam, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) bow with alacrity, and departing.
<p/>It will be perceived, as has been before intimated, that Master Sam had a native talent that might, undoubtedly, have raised him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to eminence in political life,--a talent of making capital out of everything that turned up, to be invested for his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own especial praise and glory; and having done up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) piety and humility, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) trusted, to the satisfaction of the parlor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) clapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) palm-leaf on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) head, with a sort of rakish, free-and-easy air, and proceeded to the dominions of Aunt Chloe, with the intention of flourishing largely in the kitchen.
<p/>'' I'll speechify these yer niggers,'' said Sam to himself, ``now I've got a chance. Lord, I'll reel it off to make 'em stare!
<p/>It must be observed that one of Sam's especial delights had been to ride in attendance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) master to all kinds of political gatherings, where, roosted on some rail fence, or perched aloft in some tree, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would sit watching the orators, with the greatest apparent gusto, and then, descending among the various brethren of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own color, assembled on the same errand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would edify and delight them with the most ludicrous burlesques and imitations, all delivered with the most imperturbable earnestness and solemnity; and though the auditors immediately about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) were generally of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own color, it not infrequently happened that they were fringed pretty deeply with those of a fairer complexion, who listened, laughing and winking, to Sam's great self-congratulation.
<p/>Now, between Sam and Aunt Chloe there had existed, from ancient times, a sort of chronic feud, or rather a decided coolness; but, as Sam was meditating something in the provision department, as the necessary and obvious foundation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) operations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) determined, on the present occasion, to be eminently conciliatory; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) well knew that although <div class="bookquote">``Missis' orders''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>would undoubtedly be followed to the letter, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) should gain a considerable deal by enlisting the spirit also.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) therefore appeared before Aunt Chloe with a touchingly subdued, resigned expression, like one who has suffered immeasurable hardships in behalf of a persecuted fellow-creature,--enlarged upon the fact that Missis had directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) to come to Aunt Chloe for whatever might be wanting to make up the balance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) solids and fluids,--and thus unequivocally acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) right and supremacy in the cooking department, and all thereto pertaining.
<p/>'' In fact, Sam considered oratory as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) vocation, and never let slip an opportunity of magnifying his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) office. The thing took accordingly.
<p/>No poor, simple, virtuous body was ever cajoled by the attentions of an electioneering politician with more ease than Aunt Chloe was won over by Master Sam's suavities; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) had been the prodigal son himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) could not have been overwhelmed with more maternal bountifulness; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) soon found himself seated, happy and glorious, over a large tin pan, containing a sort of olla podrida of all that had appeared on the table for two or three days past.
<p/>Savory morsels of ham, golden blocks of corn-cake, fragments of pie of every conceivable mathematical figure, chicken wings, gizzards, and drumsticks, all appeared in picturesque confusion; and Sam, as monarch of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) surveyed, sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) palm-leaf cocked rejoicingly to one side, and patronizing Andy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) right hand.
<p/>The kitchen was full of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Andy</b></font>) compeers, who had hurried and crowded in, from the various cabins, to hear the termination of the day's exploits.
<p/>The story of the day was rehearsed, with all kinds of ornament and varnishing which might be necessary to heighten its effect; for Sam, like some of our fashionable dilettanti, never allowed a story to lose any of its gilding by passing through his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Roars of laughter attended the narration, and were taken up and prolonged by all the smaller fry, who were lying, in any quantity, about on the floor, or perched in every corner.
<p/>In the height of the uproar and laughter, Sam, however, preserved an immovable gravity, only from time to time rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) eyes up, and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) auditors divers inexpressibly droll glances, without departing from the sententious elevation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) oratory.
<p/>Now was Sam's hour of glory. '' Yer see, fellow-countrymen,'' said Sam, elevating a turkey's leg, with energy, ``yer see, now what dis
<p/>For him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) as tries to get one o' our people is as good as tryin' to get all; yer see the principle 's de same,--dat ar's clar.
<p/>And any one o' these yer drivers that comes smelling round arter any our people, why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'s got me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) way; I'm the feller he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>)'s got to set in with,--I'm the feller for yer all to come to, bredren,--I'll stand up for yer rights,--I'll fend

<p/>I tell you now, Andy,'' said Sam, with awful superiority, <div class="bookquote">``don't yer be a talkin' `bout what yer don't know nothin' on; boys like you, Andy, means well, but they can't be spected to collusitate the great principles of action.
<p/>Andy looked rebuked, particularly by the hard word collusitate, which most of the youngerly members of the company seemed to consider as a settler in the case, while Sam proceeded.
<p/>Dat ar was conscience , Andy; when I thought of gwine arter Lizy, I railly spected Mas'r was sot dat way.
<p/>When I found Missis was sot the contrar, dat ar was conscience more yet ,--cause fellers allers gets more by stickin' to

'' Dis yer matter `bout persistence, feller-niggers,'' said Sam, with the air of one entering into an abstruse subject,
<p/>Now, yer see, when a feller stands up for a thing one day and night, de contrar de next, folks ses -LRB-and nat`rally enough dey ses-RRB-, why he (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) an't persistent,--hand me dat ar bit o' corn-cake, Andy.

 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div><p/>'' muttered Aunt Chloe, who was getting rather restive; the merriment of the evening being to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) somewhat after the Scripture comparison,--like <div class="bookquote">``vinegar upon nitre.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>It's the only thing ye ever was persistent in, Lord knows! '' '' Yes, indeed!'' said Sam, rising, full of supper and glory, for a closing effort.

<p/>yer <div class="bookquote">``Niggers! all on yer ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And, with this pathetic benediction, the assembly dispersed. CHAPTER IX In Which It Appears That a Senator Is
<p/>The light of the cheerful fire shone on the rug and carpet of a cosey parlor, and glittered on the sides of the tea-cups and well-brightened tea-pot, as Senator Bird was drawing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) boots, preparatory to inserting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) feet in a pair of new handsome slippers, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) wife had been working for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) while away on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) senatorial tour.
<p/>Mrs. Bird, looking the very picture of delight, was superintending the arrangements of the table, ever and anon mingling admonitory remarks to a number of frolicsome juveniles, who were effervescing in all those modes of untold gambol and mischief that have astonished mothers ever since the flood.
<p/>Jim, you mustn't climb on that table,--no, no!--You don't know, my dear, what a surprise it is to us all, to see you here tonight!
<p/>But a Man '' Tom, let the door-knob alone,--there's a man! Mary! Mary! don't pull the cat's tail,--poor pussy! '' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), at last, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found a space to say something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband.
<p/>'' Yes, yes, I thought I'd just make a run down, spend the night, and have a little comfort at home.
<p/>Mrs. Bird cast a glance at a camphor-bottle, which stood in the half-open closet, and appeared to meditate an approach to it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) husband interposed.
<p/>I'm tired to death, and my head aches! '' '' No, no, Mary, no doctoring! a cup of your good hot tea, and some of our good home living, is what I want.
<p/>It's a tiresome business, this legislating!'' And the senator smiled, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) rather liked the idea of considering himself a sacrifice to his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) country.
<p/>Well,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) wife, after the business of the tea-table was getting rather slack, <div class="bookquote">``and what have they been doing in the Senate?
<p/>Now, it was a very unusual thing for gentle little Mrs. Bird ever to trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) head with what was going on in the house of the state, very wisely considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) had enough to do to mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) own.
<p/>Well; but is it true that they have been passing a law forbidding people to give meat and drink to those poor colored folks that come along?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Bird, therefore, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) eyes in surprise, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Not very much of importance.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div>'' I heard they were talking of some such law, but I didn't think any Christian legislature would pass it!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Mary, you are getting to be a politician, all at once. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, nonsense! I wouldn't give a fig for all your politics, generally, but I think this is something downright cruel and unchristian.
<p/>There has been a law passed forbidding people to help off the slaves that come over from Kentucky, my dear; so much of that thing has been done by these reckless Abolitionists, that our brethren in Kentucky are very strongly excited, and it seems necessary, and no more than Christian and kind, that something should be done by our state to quiet the excitement.''
 (<font color='red'><b>those creatures night</b></font>)</div><p/>It don't forbid us to shelter those poor creatures a night, does it, and to give 'em something comfortable to eat, and a few old clothes, and send them quietly about their business?''
<p/>I hope, my dear, no such law has been passed.'' '' '' And what is the law? <div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, my dear; that would be aiding and abetting, you know.
<p/>Mrs. Bird was a timid, blushing little woman, of about four feet in height, and with mild blue eyes, and a peach-blow complexion, and the gentlest, sweetest voice in the world;--as for courage, a moderate-sized cock-turkey had been known to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) to rout at the very first gobble, and a stout house-dog, of moderate capacity, would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) into subjection merely by a show of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) teeth.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) husband and children were her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) entire world, and in these she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) ruled more by entreaty and persuasion than by command or argument.
<p/>There was only one thing that was capable of arousing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>), and that provocation came in on the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) unusually gentle and sympathetic nature;--anything in the shape of cruelty would throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) into a passion, which was the more alarming and inexplicable in proportion to the general softness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) nature.
<p/>Generally the most indulgent and easy to be entreated of all mothers, still her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) boys had a very reverent remembrance of a most vehement chastisement she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) once bestowed on them, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) found them leagued with several graceless boys of the neighborhood, stoning a defenceless kitten.
<p/>Mother came at me so that I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was crazy, and I was whipped and tumbled off to bed, without any supper, before I could get over wondering what had come about; and, after that, I heard mother crying outside the door, which made me feel worse than all the rest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'll tell you what,'' Master Bill used to say, <div class="bookquote">``I was scared that time. I'll tell you what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)'d say, <div class="bookquote">``we boys never stoned another kitten!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On the present occasion, Mrs. Bird rose quickly, with very red cheeks, which quite improved her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) general appearance, and walked up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) husband, with quite a resolute air, and said, in a determined tone, <div class="bookquote">``Now, John, I want to know if you think such a law as that is right and Christian?''
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You won't shoot me, now, Mary, if I say I do!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never could have thought it of you, John; you didn't vote for it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It's a shameful, wicked, abominable law, and I'll break it, for one, the first time I get a chance; and I hope I shall have a chance, I do!
<p/>Things have got to a pretty pass, if a woman can't give a warm supper and a bed to poor, starving creatures, just because they are slaves, and have been abused and oppressed all their lives, poor things!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Even so, my fair politician. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You ought to be ashamed, John! Poor, homeless, houseless creatures! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>But, Mary, just listen to me.
<p/>Your feelings are all quite right, dear, and interesting, and I love you for them; but, then, dear, we mustn't suffer our feelings to run away with our judgment; you must consider it's a matter of private feeling,--there
<p/>are great public interests involved,--there is such a state of public agitation rising, that we must put aside our private feelings.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, John, I don't know anything about politics, but I can read my Bible; and there I see that I must feed the hungry, clothe the naked, and comfort the desolate; and that Bible I mean to follow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But in cases where your doing so would involve a great public evil--'' <div class="bookquote">``Obeying God never brings on public evils.
<p/>I know it can't. It's always safest, all round, to do as He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bids us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Now, listen to me, Mary, and I can state to you a very clear argument, to show--
<p/>I put it to you, John,--would you now turn away a poor, shivering, hungry creature from your door, because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was a runaway?
<p/>Now, if the truth must be told, our senator had the misfortune to be a man who had a particularly humane and accessible nature, and turning away anybody that was in trouble
<p/>never had been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forte; and what was worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in this particular pinch of the argument was, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife knew it, and, of course was making an assault on rather an indefensible point.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had recourse to the usual means of gaining time for such cases made and provided; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``ahem,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and coughed several times, took out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief, and began to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glasses.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``O, nonsense, John! you can talk all night, but you wouldn't do it. Would you, now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bird, seeing the defenceless condition of the enemy's territory, had no more conscience than to push her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) advantage.
<p/>Turning a woman out of doors in a snowstorm, for instance; or may be you'd take her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) up and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) in jail, wouldn't you?
<p/>'' I should like to see you doing that, John--I really should! You would make a great hand at that!'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course, it would be a very painful duty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div>began Mr. Bird, in a moderate tone.
<p/>'' Duty, John! don't use that word! You know it isn't a duty--it can't be a duty! If folks want to keep their slaves from running away, let 'em treat
<p/>If I had slaves -LRB-as I hope I never shall have-RRB-, I'd risk their wanting to run away from me, or you either, John.
<p/>'em well,--that's my doctrine. I tell you folks don't run away when they are happy; and when they do run, poor creatures!
<p/>they suffer enough with cold and hunger and fear, without everybody's turning against them; and, law or no law, I never will, so help me God!''
<p/>There's a way you political folks have of coming round and round a plain right thing; and you don't believe in it yourselves, when it comes to practice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary! Mary! My dear, let me reason with you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hate reasoning, John,--especially reasoning on such subjects. I know you well enough, John.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>At this critical juncture, old Cudjoe, the black man-of-all-work, put his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head in at the door, and wished <div class="bookquote">``Missis would come into the kitchen;''  (<font color='red'><b>senator</b></font>)</div>and our senator, tolerably relieved, looked after his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) little wife with a whimsical mixture of amusement and vexation, and, seating himself in the arm-chair, began to read the papers.
<p/>You don't believe it's right any more than I do; and you wouldn't do it any sooner than I. After a moment, his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) wife's voice was heard at the door, in a quick, earnest tone,--<div class="bookquote">``John!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) paper, and went into the kitchen, and started, quite amazed at the sight that presented itself:--A young and slender woman, with garments torn and frozen, with one shoe gone, and the stocking torn away from the cut and bleeding foot, was laid back in a deadly swoon upon two chairs.
<p/>There was the impress of the despised race on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, yet none could help feeling its mournful and pathetic beauty, while its stony sharpness, its cold, fixed, deathly aspect, struck a solemn chill over him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wife, and their only colored domestic, old Aunt Dinah, were busily engaged in restorative measures; while old Cudjoe had got the boy on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knee, and was busy pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoes and stockings, and chafing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little cold feet.
<p/>Sure, now, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) an't a sight to behold!''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said old Dinah, compassionately; ''`pears like 't was the heat that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) faint.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was tol`able peart when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cum in, and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) couldn't warm herself here a spell; and I was just a-askin' her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) cum from, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) fainted right down.
<p/>John! I do wish you'd come here, a moment. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) breath short, and stood in silence. '' Never done much hard work, guess, by the looks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Poor creature!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bird, compassionately, as the woman slowly unclosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) large, dark eyes, and looked vacantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>).
<p/>Suddenly an expression of agony crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) sprang up, saying, <div class="bookquote">``O, my Harry! Have they got him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The boy, at this, jumped from Cudjoe's knee, and running to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) side put up his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms. '' O, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s here!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s here! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) exclaimed. '' O, ma'am!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>), wildly, to Mrs. Bird, <div class="bookquote">``do protect us! don't let them get him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God bless you!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, covering her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face and sobbing; while the little boy, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) crying, tried to get into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap.
<p/>With many gentle and womanly offices, which none knew better how to render than Mrs. Bird, the poor woman was, in time, rendered more calm.
<p/>A temporary bed was provided for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) on the settle, near the fire; and, after a short time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) fell into a heavy slumber, with the child, who seemed no less weary, soundly sleeping on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) arm
<p/>; for the mother resisted, with nervous anxiety, the kindest attempts to take him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>); and, even in sleep, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) arm encircled him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with an unrelaxing clasp, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) could not even then be beguiled of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) vigilant hold.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Bird had gone back to the parlor, where, strange as it may appear, no reference was made, on either side, to the preceding conversation; but Mrs. Bird busied herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) knitting-work, and Mr. Bird pretended to be reading the paper.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nobody shall hurt you here, poor woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bird, encouragingly. '' You are safe; don't be afraid. '' '' I wonder who and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) is!'' said Mr. Bird, at last, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) laid it down.
<p/>'' When she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) wakes up and feels a little rested, we will see,'' said Mrs. Bird. '' I say, wife!'' said Mr. Bird after musing in silence over his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) newspaper.
<p/>'' Well, dear!'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) couldn't wear one of your gowns, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>), by any letting down, or such matter? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) seems to be rather larger than you are.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div>A quite perceptible smile glimmered on Mrs. Bird's face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``We'll see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Another pause, and Mr. Bird again broke out, <div class="bookquote">``I say, wife!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, there's that old bombazin cloak, that you keep on purpose to put over me when I take my afternoon's nap; you might as well give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that,--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) needs clothes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Well! What now?'' '' At this instant, Dinah looked in to say that the woman was awake, and wanted to see Missis.
<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Bird went into the kitchen, followed by the two eldest boys, the smaller fry having, by this time, been safely disposed of in bed.
<p/>The woman was now sitting up on the settle, by the fire. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was looking steadily into the blaze, with a calm, heart-broken expression, very different from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) former agitated wildness.
<p/>'' Did you want me?'' said Mrs. Bird, in gentle tones. '' I hope you feel better now, poor woman! ''
<p/>A long-drawn, shivering sigh was the only answer; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) dark eyes, and fixed them on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) with such a forlorn and imploring expression, that the tears came into the little woman's eyes.
<p/>'' You needn't be afraid of anything; we are friends here, poor woman! Tell me where you came from, and what you want,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>'' I came from Kentucky,'' said the woman. '' When?'' said Mr. Bird, taking up the interogatory. '' Tonight. '' <div class="bookquote">``How did you come?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I crossed on the ice.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Crossed on the ice!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said every one present. '' Yes,'' said the woman, slowly, ``I did.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Law, Missis,''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>said Cudjoe, <div class="bookquote">``the ice is all in broken-up blocks, a swinging and a tetering up and down in the water!''
 (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div><p/>God helping me, I crossed on the ice; for they were behind me--right behind--and there was no other way!'' <div class="bookquote">``I know it was--I know it!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), wildly; <div class="bookquote">``but I did it!
<p/>I wouldn't have thought I could,--I didn't think I should get over, but I didn't care! I could but die, if I didn't.
<p/>The Lord helped me; nobody knows how much the Lord can help 'em, till they try,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the woman, with a flashing eye.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Were you a slave?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bird. '' Yes, sir; I belonged to a man in Kentucky. '' <div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) unkind to you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, sir; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) was a good master.'' '' And was your mistress unkind to you?'' '' No, sir--no! my mistress was always good to me.
<p/>The woman looked up at Mrs. Bird, with a keen, scrutinizing glance, and it did not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) was dressed in deep mourning.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What could induce you to leave a good home, then, and run away, and go through such dangers? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>The question was unexpected, and it was thrust on a new wound; for it was only a month since a darling child of the family had been laid in the grave.
<p/>Mr. Bird turned around and walked to the window, and Mrs. Bird burst into tears; but, recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Why do you ask that?
<p/>Ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) said, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``have you ever lost a child?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I have lost a little one.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you will feel for me.
<p/>I have lost two, one after another,--left 'em buried there when I came away; and I had only this one left.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) was my comfort and pride, day and night; and, ma'am, they were going to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) away from me,--to sell
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>),--sell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) down south, ma'am, to go all alone,--a baby that had never been away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) mother in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) life!
<p/>I knew I never should be good for anything, if they did; and when I knew the papers the papers were signed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) was sold, I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) and came off in the night; and they chased me,--the man that bought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and some of Mas`r's
<p/>I never slept a night without him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was all I had. I couldn't stand it, ma'am. folks,--and they were coming down right behind me, and I heard 'em.
<p/>I jumped right on to the ice; and how I got across, I don't know,--but, first I knew, a man was helping me up the bank.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had gone to a place where tears are dry; but every one around her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was, in some way characteristic of themselves, showing signs of hearty sympathy.
<p/>The two little boys, after a desperate rummaging in their pockets, in search of those pocket-handkerchiefs which mothers know are never to be found there, had thrown themselves disconsolately into the skirts of their mother's gown, where they were sobbing, and wiping their eyes and noses, to their hearts' content;--Mrs.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. The woman</b></font>)</div>The woman did not sob nor weep. Bird had her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) face fairly hidden in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief; and old Dinah, with tears streaming down her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) black, honest face, was ejaculating, <div class="bookquote">``Lord have mercy on us!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>with all the fervor of a camp-meeting;--while old Cudjoe, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) eyes very hard with his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) cuffs, and making a most uncommon variety of wry faces, occasionally responded in the same key, with great fervor.
<p/>Our senator was a statesman, and of course could not be expected to cry, like other mortals; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) back to the company, and looked out of the window, and seemed particularly busy in clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) throat and wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) spectacle-glasses, occasionally blowing his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) nose in a manner that was calculated to excite suspicion, had any one been in a state to observe critically.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) suddenly exclaimed, gulping down very resolutely some kind of rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) throat, and turning suddenly round upon the woman. ''
<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was a kind master; I'll say that of him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>), any way;--and my mistress was kind; but they couldn't help themselves.
<p/>'' How came you to tell me you had a kind master? '' They were owing money; and there was some way
<p/>, I can't tell how, that a man had a hold on them, and they were obliged to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will.
<p/>I listened, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) telling mistress that, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) begging and pleading for me,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't help himself, and that the papers were all drawn;--and
<p/>I knew 't was no use of my trying to live, if they did it; for 't `pears like this child is all I have.
<p/>then it was I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and left my home, and came away. '' <div class="bookquote">``Have you no husband?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) belongs to another man.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) master is real hard to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and won't let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) come to see me, hardly ever; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s grown harder and harder upon us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) threatens to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) down south;--it's like I'll never see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) again!
<p/>The quiet tone in which the woman pronounced these words might have led a superficial observer to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was entirely apathetic; but there was a calm, settled depth of anguish in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) large, dark eye, that spoke of something far otherwise.
<p/>'' '' And where do you mean to go, my poor woman?'' said Mrs. Bird. '' To Canada, if I only knew where that was.
<p/>Is it very far off, is Canada? '' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>), looking up, with a simple, confiding air, to Mrs. Bird's face.
<p/>'' Poor thing!'' said Mrs. Bird, involuntarily. '' Is 't a very great way off, think?'' said the woman, earnestly. ''
<p/>Much further than you think, poor child!'' said Mrs. Bird; <div class="bookquote">``but we will try to think what can be done for you.
<p/>Here, Dinah, make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) up a bed in your own room, close by the kitchen, and I'll think what to do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) in the morning.
<p/>Meanwhile, never fear, poor woman; put your trust in God; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will protect you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bird/Bird</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bird and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) husband reentered the parlor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) sat down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) little rocking-chair before the fire, swaying thoughtfully to and fro. Mr. Bird strode up and down the room, grumbling to himself, ``Pish!
<p/>At length, striding up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I say, wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)'ll have to get away from here, this very night.
<p/>That fellow will be down on the scent bright and early tomorrow morning: if 't was only the woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could lie quiet till it was over; but that little chap can't be kept still by a troop of horse and foot, I'll warrant me; he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'ll bring it all out, popping his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) head out of some window or door.
<p/>pshaw! confounded awkward business!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A pretty kettle of fish it would be for me, too, to be caught with them both here, just now!
<p/>Well, I know pretty well where to,'' said the senator, beginning to put on his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) boots, with a reflective air; and, stopping when his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) leg was half in, he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) embraced his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) knee with both hands, and seemed to go off in deep meditation.
<p/>It's a confounded awkward, ugly business,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>), at last, beginning to tug at his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) boot-straps again, <div class="bookquote">``and that's a fact!
<p/>After one boot was fairly on, the senator sat with the other in his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) hand, profoundly studying the figure of the carpet.
<p/>No; they'll have to be got off tonight.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Tonight! How is it possible?--where to?'' '' '' '' '' It will have to be done, though, for aught
<p/>I see,--hang it all!'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) drew the other boot anxiously on, and looked out of the window. Now, little Mrs. Bird was a discreet woman,--a woman who never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) life said, <div class="bookquote">``I told you so!
<p/>and, on the present occasion, though pretty well aware of the shape her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) husband's meditations were taking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) very prudently forbore to meddle with them, only sat very quietly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) chair, and looked quite ready to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) liege lord's intentions, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) should think proper to utter them.
<p/>You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there's my old client, Van Trompe, has come over from Kentucky, and set all his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) slaves free; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) has bought a place seven miles up the creek, here, back in the woods, where nobody goes, unless they go on purpose; and it's a place that isn't found in a hurry.
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>)'d be safe enough; but the plague of the thing is, nobody could drive a carriage there tonight, but me .''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The creek has to be crossed twice; and the second crossing is quite dangerous, unless one knows it as I do.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Why not? Cudjoe is an excellent driver. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ay, ay, but here it is. I have crossed it a hundred times on horseback, and know exactly the turns to take.
<p/>Cudjoe must put in the horses, as quietly as may be, about twelve o'clock, and I'll take her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) over; and then, to give color to the matter, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) must carry me on to the next tavern to take the stage for Columbus, that comes by about three or four, and so it will look as if I had had the carriage only for that.
<p/>But I'm thinking I shall feel rather cheap there, after all that's been said and done; but, hang it, I can't help it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Your heart is better than your head, in this case, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wife</b></font>)</div>said the wife, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little white hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>And so, you see, there's no help for it. I shall get into business bright and early in the morning. ''
<p/>And the little woman looked so handsome, with the tears sparkling in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, that the senator thought he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) must be a decidedly clever fellow, to get such a pretty creature into such a passionate admiration of him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>); and so, what could he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) do but walk off soberly, to see about the carriage.
<p/>Could I ever have loved you, had I not known you better than you know yourself?'' At the door, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) stopped a moment, and then coming back, he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) said, with some hesitation.
<p/>'' Mary, I don't know how you'd feel about it, but there's that drawer full of things--of--of--poor little Henry's. '' So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) turned quickly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heel, and shut the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wife opened the little bed-room door adjoining her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) room and, taking the candle, set it down on the top of a bureau there; then from a small recess she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) took a key, and put it thoughtfully in the lock of a drawer, and made a sudden pause, while two boys, who, boy like, had followed close on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heels, stood looking, with silent, significant glances, at their mother.
<p/>mother that reads this, has there never been in your house a drawer, or a closet, the opening of which has been to you like the opening again of a little grave?
<p/>There were little coats of many a form and pattern, piles of aprons, and rows of small stockings; and even a pair of little shoes, worn and rubbed at the toes, were peeping from the folds of a paper.
<p/>And oh! Ah! happy mother that you are, if it has not been so. Mrs. Bird slowly opened the drawer. There was a toy horse and wagon, a top, a ball,--memorials gathered with many a tear and many a heart-break!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) sat down by the drawer, and, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) hands over it, wept till the tears fell through her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) fingers into the drawer; then suddenly raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) began, with nervous haste, selecting the plainest and most substantial articles, and gathering them into a bundle.
<p/>My dear boys,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) said, softly and earnestly, ``if our dear, loving little Henry looks down from heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would be glad to have us do this.
<p/>I could not find it in my heart to give them away to any common person--to anybody that was happy; but I give them to a mother more heart-broken and sorrowful than I am; and I hope God will send his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) blessings with them!
<p/>There are in this world blessed souls, whose sorrows all spring up into joys for others; whose earthly hopes, laid in the grave with many tears, are the seed from which spring healing flowers and balm for the desolate and the distressed.
<p/>Among such was the delicate woman who sits there by the lamp, dropping slow tears, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) prepares the memorials of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own lost one for the outcast wanderer.
<p/>After a while, Mrs. Bird opened a wardrobe, and, taking from thence a plain, serviceable dress or two, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) sat down busily to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) work-table, and, with needle, scissors, and thimble, at hand, quietly commenced the <div class="bookquote">``letting down''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>process which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) husband had recommended, and continued busily at it till the old clock in the corner struck twelve, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) heard the low rattling of wheels at the door.
<p/>Mary,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) husband, coming in, with his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) overcoat in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hand, ``you must wake her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) up now; we must be off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>said one of the boys, gently touching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``you going to give away those things?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' ''
<p/>Mrs. Bird hastily deposited the various articles she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) had collected in a small plain trunk, and locking it, desired her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) husband to see it in the carriage, and then proceeded to call the woman.
<p/>Soon, arrayed in a cloak, bonnet, and shawl, that had belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) benefactress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) appeared at the door with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) arms.
<p/>Eliza leaned out of the carriage, and put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) hand,--a hand as soft and beautiful as was given in return.
<p/>Mr. Bird hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) into the carriage, and Mrs. Bird pressed on after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) to the carriage steps. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) large, dark eyes, full of earnest meaning, on Mrs. Bird's face, and seemed going to speak.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) lips moved,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) tried once or twice, but there was no sound,--and pointing upward, with a look never to be forgotten, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) fell back in the seat, and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bird</b></font>) face.
<p/>What a situation, now, for a patriotic senator, that had been all the week before spurring up the legislature of his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) native state to pass more stringent resolutions against escaping fugitives, their harborers and abettors!
<p/>Our good senator in his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) native state had not been exceeded by any of his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) brethren at Washington, in the sort of eloquence which has won for them immortal renown!
<p/>How sublimely he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) had sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) pockets, and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put the welfare of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests!
<p/>The door was shut, and the carriage drove on. He (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was as bold as a lion about it, and <div class="bookquote">``mightily convinced''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>not only himself, but everybody that heard
<p/>him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>);--but then his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) idea of a fugitive was only an idea of the letters that spell the word,--or at the most, the image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and bundle with <div class="bookquote">``Ran away from the subscriber''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>under it.
<p/>The magic of the real presence of distress,--the imploring human eye, the frail, trembling human hand, the despairing appeal of helpless agony,--these he (<font color='blue'><b>Ran</b></font>) had never tried.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ran</b></font>) had never thought that a fugitive might be a hapless mother, a defenceless child,--like that one which was now wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ran</b></font>) lost boy's little well-known cap; and so, as our poor senator was not stone or
<p/>steel,--as he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was a man, and a downright noble-hearted one , too,--he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was, as everybody must see, in a sad case for his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) patriotism.
<p/>And you need not exult over him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>), good brother of the Southern States; for we have some inklings that many of you, under similar circumstances, would not do much better.
<p/>We have reason to know, in Kentucky, as in Mississippi, are noble and generous hearts, to whom never was tale of suffering told in vain.
<p/>is it fair for you to expect of us services which your own brave, honorable heart would not allow you to render, were you in our place?
<p/>Be that as it may, if our good senator was a political sinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was in a fair way to expiate it by his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) night's penance.
<p/>There had been a long continuous period of rainy weather, and the soft, rich earth of Ohio, as every one knows, is admirably suited to the manufacture of mud--and the road was an Ohio railroad of the good old times.
<p/>And pray, what sort of a road may that be?'' says some eastern traveller, who has been accustomed to connect no ideas with a railroad, but those of smoothness or speed.
<p/>Know, then, innocent eastern friend, that in benighted regions of the west, where the mud is of unfathomable and sublime depth, roads are made of round rough logs, arranged transversely side by side, and coated over in their pristine freshness with earth, turf, and whatsoever may come to hand, and then the rejoicing native calleth
<p/>In process of time, the rains wash off all the turf and grass aforesaid, move the logs hither and thither, in picturesque positions, up, down and crosswise, with divers chasms and ruts of black mud intervening.
<p/>Over such a road as this our senator went stumbling along, making moral reflections as continuously as under the circumstances could be expected,--the carriage proceeding along much as follows,--bump!
<p/>down in the mud!--the senator, woman and child, reversing their positions so suddenly as to come, without any very accurate adjustment, against the windows of the down-hill side.
<p/>Ah, good brother! '' it a road, and straightway essayeth to ride thereupon. bump! bump! slush! Carriage sticks fast, while Cudjoe on the outside is heard making a great muster among the horses.
<p/>After various ineffectual pullings and twitchings, just as the senator is losing all patience, the carriage suddenly rights itself with a bounce,--two front wheels go down into another abyss, and senator, woman, and child, all tumble promiscuously on to the front seat,--senator's hat is jammed over his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) eyes and nose quite unceremoniously, and he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) considers himself fairly extinguished;--child cries, and Cudjoe on the outside delivers animated addresses to the horses, who are kicking, and floundering, and straining under repeated cracks of the whip.
<p/>Carriage springs up, with another bounce,--down go the hind wheels,--senator, woman, and child, fly over on to the back seat, his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) elbows encountering her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet, and both her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet being jammed into his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) hat, which flies off in the concussion.
<p/>After a few moments the <div class="bookquote">``slough''  (<font color='red'><b>the senator</b></font>)</div>is passed, and the horses stop, panting;--the senator finds his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) hat, the woman straightens her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet and hushes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child, and they brace themselves for what is yet to come.
<p/>intermingled, just by way of variety, with divers side plunges and compound shakes; and they begin to flatter themselves that they are not so badly off, after all.
<p/>At last, with a square plunge, which puts all on to their feet and then down into their seats with incredible quickness, the carriage stops,--and, after much outside commotion, Cudjoe appears at the door.
<p/>For a while only the continuous bump! bump! '' Please, sir, it's powerful bad spot, this' yer. I don't know how we's to get clar out.
<p/>I'm a thinkin' we'll have to be a gettin' rails. '' The senator despairingly steps out, picking gingerly for some firm foothold; down goes one foot
<p/>an immeasurable depth,--he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) tries to pull it up, loses his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) balance, and tumbles over into the mud, and is fished out, in a very despairing condition, by Cudjoe.
<p/>Western travellers, who have beguiled the midnight hour in the interesting process of pulling down rail fences, to pry their carriages out of mud holes, will have a respectful and mournful sympathy with our unfortunate hero.
<p/>But we forbear, out of sympathy to our readers' bones. We beg them to drop a silent tear, and pass on.
<p/>It was full late in the night when the carriage emerged, dripping and bespattered, out of the creek, and stood at the door of a large farmhouse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was a great, tall, bristling Orson of a fellow, full six feet and some inches in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) stockings, and arrayed in a red flannel hunting-shirt.
<p/>A very heavy mat of sandy hair, in a decidedly tousled condition, and a beard of some days' growth, gave the worthy man an appearance, to say the least, not particularly prepossessing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood for a few minutes holding the candle aloft, and blinking on our travellers with a dismal and mystified expression that was truly ludicrous.
<p/>It cost some effort of our senator to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) to comprehend the case fully; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) is doing his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) best at that, we shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) a little introduction to our readers.
<p/>It took no inconsiderable perseverance to arouse the inmates; but at last the respectable proprietor appeared, and undid the door. Honest old John Van Trompe was once quite a considerable land-owner and slave-owner in the State of Kentucky.
<p/>Having <div class="bookquote">``nothing of the bear about him (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) but the skin,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and being gifted by nature with a great, honest, just heart, quite equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) gigantic frame, he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) had been for some years witnessing with repressed uneasiness the workings of a system equally bad for oppressor and oppressed.
<p/>At last, one day, John's great heart had swelled altogether too big to wear his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) bonds any longer; so he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) just took his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pocket-book out of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) desk, and went over into Ohio, and bought a quarter of a township of good, rich land, made out free papers for all his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) people,--men, women, and children,--packed them up in wagons, and sent them off to settle down; and then honest John turned his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face up the creek, and sat quietly down on a snug, retired farm, to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) conscience and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) reflections.
<p/>'' Are you the man that will shelter a poor woman and child from slave-catchers? '' said the senator, explicitly. ''
<p/>If there's anybody comes,'' said the good man, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tall, muscular form upward, <div class="bookquote">``why here I'm ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): and I've got seven sons, each six foot high, and they'll be ready for 'em.
<p/>I rather think I am,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man foot</b></font>)</div>said honest John, with some considerable emphasis. '' I thought so,'' said the senator. '' Give our respects to 'em,'' said John; <div class="bookquote">``tell 'em
<p/>it's no matter how soon they call,--make no kinder difference to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Bunyan/Bunyan</b></font>)</div>said John, running his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fingers through the shock of hair that thatched his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head, and bursting out into a great laugh.
<p/>Weary, jaded, and spiritless, Eliza dragged herself up to the door, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child lying in a heavy sleep on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) arm.
<p/>The rough man held the candle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) face, and uttering a kind of compassionate grunt, opened the door of a small bed-room adjoining to the large kitchen where they were standing, and motioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to go in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took down a candle, and lighting it, set it upon the table, and then addressed himself to Eliza. '' Now, I say, gal, you needn't be a bit afeard, let who will come here.
<p/>I'm up to all that sort o' thing,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), pointing to two or three goodly rifles over the mantel-piece; <div class="bookquote">``and most people that know me know that 't wouldn't be healthy to try to get anybody out
<p/>So now you jist go to sleep now, as quiet as if yer mother was a rockin' ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut the door.
<p/>o' my house when I'm agin it. '' Why, this is an uncommon handsome un,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said to the senator. ''
<p/>Ah, well; handsome uns has the greatest cause to run, sometimes, if they has any kind o' feelin, such as decent women should.
<p/>I know all about that. '' The senator, in a few words, briefly explained Eliza's history. '' O! ou! aw! now, I want to know?'' said the good man, pitifully; <div class="bookquote">``sho! now sho!
<p/>hunted down now like a deer,--hunted down, jest for havin' natural feelin's, and doin' what no kind o' mother could help a doin'!
<p/>I tell ye what, these yer things make me come the nighest to swearin', now, o' most anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man sho</b></font>)</div>said honest John, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes with the back of a great, freckled, yellow hand.
<p/>I tell yer what, stranger, it was years and years before I'd jine the church, 'cause the ministers round in our parts used to preach that the Bible went in for these ere cuttings
<p/>up,--and I couldn't be up to 'em with their Greek and Hebrew, and so I took up agin 'em, Bible and all.
<p/>I never jined the church till I found a minister that was up to 'em all in Greek and all that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) said right the contrary; and then I took right hold, and jined the church,--I did now, fact,'' said John, who had been all this time uncorking some very frisky bottled cider, which at this juncture he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) presented.
<p/>Ye'd better jest put up here, now, till daylight,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), heartily, <div class="bookquote">``and I'll call up the old woman, and have a bed got ready for you in no time.
<p/>That's natur now, poor crittur! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my good friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>the senator</b></font>)</div>said the senator, ``I must be along, to take the night stage for Columbus.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! well, then, if you must, I'll go a piece with you, and show you a cross road that will take you there better than the road you came on.
<p/>John equipped himself, and, with a lantern in hand, was soon seen guiding the senator's carriage towards a road that ran down in a hollow, back of his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) dwelling.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That road's mighty bad. '' When they parted, the senator put into his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) hand a ten-dollar bill. '' It's for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) said, briefly.
<p/>'' Ay, ay,'' said John, with equal conciseness. They shook hands, and parted. CHAPTER X The Property Is Carried Off The February morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of Uncle Tom's cabin.
<p/>The little table stood out before the fire, covered with an ironing-cloth; a coarse but clean shirt or two, fresh from the iron, hung on the back of a chair by the fire, and Aunt Chloe had another spread out before her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) on the table.
<p/>Carefully she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) rubbed and ironed every fold and every hem, with the most scrupulous exactness, every now and then raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) face to wipe off the tears that were coursing down her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>It looked on downcast faces, the images of mournful hearts. Tom sat by, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Testament open on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knee, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head leaning upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
<p/>hand;--but neither spoke. It was yet early, and the children lay all asleep together in their little rude trundle-bed. Tom, who had, to the full, the gentle, domestic heart, which woe for them!
<p/>has been a peculiar characteristic of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) unhappy race, got up and walked silently to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) children. '' It's the last time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said.
<p/>Aunt Chloe did not answer, only rubbed away over and over on the coarse shirt, already as smooth as hands could make it; and finally setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) iron suddenly down with a despairing plunge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) sat down to the table, and <div class="bookquote">``lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) voice and wept.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm in the Lord's hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``nothin' can go no furder than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lets it;--and thar's one thing I can thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) for.

<p/>'' Ah, brave, manly heart,--smothering thine own sorrow, to comfort thy beloved ones! Tom spoke with a thick utterance, and with a bitter choking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let's think on our marcies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, tremulously, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was quite sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) needed to think on them very hard indeed.
<p/>throat,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spoke brave and strong. <div class="bookquote">``Marcies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Chloe; <div class="bookquote">``don't see no marcy in `t! ' tan't right! tan't right it should be so!

<p/>But dar's no use talkin'; I'll jes wet up de corn-cake, and get ye one good breakfast, 'cause nobody knows when you'll get another.
<p/>In order to appreciate the sufferings of the negroes sold south, it must be remembered that all the instinctive affections of that race are peculiarly strong.
<p/>Add to this all the terrors with which ignorance invests the unknown, and add to this, again, that selling to the south is set before the negro from childhood as the last severity of punishment.
<p/>'' '' Their local attachments are very abiding. They are not naturally daring and enterprising, but home-loving and affectionate. The threat that terrifies more than whipping or torture of any kind is the threat of being sent down river.
<p/>We have ourselves heard this feeling expressed by them, and seen the unaffected horror with which they will sit in their gossipping hours, and tell frightful stories of that <div class="bookquote">``down river,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which to them is <div class="bookquote">``That undiscovered country, from whose bourn No traveller returns.
<p/>A missionary figure among the fugitives in Canada told us that many of the fugitives confessed themselves to have escaped from comparatively kind masters, and that they were induced to brave the perils of escape, in almost every case, by the desperate horror with which they regarded being sold south,--a doom which was hanging either over themselves or their husbands, their wives or children.
<p/>This nerves the African, naturally patient, timid and unenterprising, with heroic courage, and leads him (<font color='blue'><b>African</b></font>) to suffer hunger, cold, pain, the perils of the wilderness, and the more dread penalties of recapture.
<p/>The simple morning meal now smoked on the table, for Mrs. Shelby had excused Aunt Chloe's attendance at the great house that morning.
<p/>The poor soul had expended all her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) little energies on this farewell feast,--had killed and dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) choicest chicken, and prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) corn-cake with scrupulous exactness, just to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) husband's taste, and brought out certain mysterious jars on the mantel-piece, some preserves that were never produced except on extreme occasions.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mose</b></font>)</div>at the same time catching at a fragment of the chicken. Aunt Chloe gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mose</b></font>) a sudden box on the ear.
<p/>'' Thar now! crowing over the last breakfast yer poor daddy's gwine to have to home!'' <div class="bookquote">``O, Chloe! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, gently.

<p/>'' To think on `t! no crittur to do for ye, sick or well! I don't railly think I ought ter be good now!
<p/>The boys, having eaten everything there was on the breakfast-table, began now to take some thought of the case; and, seeing their mother crying, and their father looking very sad, began to whimper and put their hands to their eyes.
<p/>Uncle Tom had the baby on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knee, and was letting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) enjoy herself to the utmost extent, scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face and pulling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hair, and occasionally breaking out into clamorous explosions of delight, evidently arising out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own internal reflections.

<p/>'' '' Ay, crow away, poor crittur!'' said Aunt Chloe; <div class="bookquote">``ye'll have to come to it, too! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>Here one of the boys called out, <div class="bookquote">``Thar's Missis a-comin' in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the boys</b></font>)</div><p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) can't do no good; what's she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) coming for?'' said Aunt Chloe. Mrs. Shelby entered. Aunt Chloe set a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) in a manner decidedly gruff and crusty.
<p/>Tom,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I come to--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and stopping suddenly, and regarding the silent group, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) sat down in the chair, and, covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) handkerchief, began to sob.
<p/>Lor, now, Missis, don't--don't!'' said Aunt Chloe, bursting out in her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) turn; and for a few moments they all wept in company.
<p/>And in those tears they all shed together, the high and the lowly, melted away all the heart-burnings and anger of the oppressed.
<p/>O, ye who visit the distressed, do ye know that everything your money can buy, given with a cold, averted face, is not worth one honest tear shed in real sympathy?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) did not seem to notice either the action or the manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) looked pale and anxious. '' '' '' My good fellow,'' said Mrs. Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``I can't give you anything to do you any good.
<p/>But I tell you solemnly, and before God, that I will keep trace of you, and bring you back as soon as I can command the money;--and, till then, trust in God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div><p/>If I give you money, it will only be taken from you. Here the boys called out that Mas'r Haley was coming, and then an unceremonious kick pushed open the door.
<p/>Haley stood there in very ill humor, having ridden hard the night before, and being not at all pacified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) ill success in recapturing his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) prey.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``ye nigger, ye'r ready? Servant, ma'am! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>), taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) hat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Servant</b></font>) saw Mrs. Shelby.
<p/>Aunt Chloe shut and corded the box, and, getting up, looked gruffly on the trader, her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) tears seeming suddenly turned to sparks of fire.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) wife took the baby in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) to the wagon, and the children, still crying, trailed on behind.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby, walking up to the trader, detained him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) for a few moments, talking with him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) in an earnest manner; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was thus talking, the whole family party proceeded to a wagon, that stood ready harnessed at the door.
<p/>A crowd of all the old and young hands on the place stood gathered around it, to bid farewell to their old associate.
<p/>Tom had been looked up to, both as a head servant and a Christian teacher, by all the place, and there was much honest sympathy and grief about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), particularly among the women.
<p/>Why, Chloe, you bar it better 'n we do!'' said one of the women, who had been weeping freely, noticing the gloomy calmness with which Aunt Chloe stood by the wagon.
<p/>Tom rose up meekly, to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new master, and raised up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heavy box on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulder. '' '' I's done my tears!
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) said, looking grimly at the trader, who was coming up. '' I does not feel to cry `fore dat ar old limb, no how!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get in!''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley to Tom, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strode through the crowd of servants, who looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with lowering brows.
<p/>Tom got in, and Haley, drawing out from under the wagon seat a heavy pair of shackles, made them fast around each ankle.
<p/>A smothered groan of indignation ran through the whole circle, and Mrs. Shelby spoke from the verandah,--<div class="bookquote">``Mr. Haley, I assure you that precaution is entirely unnecessary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don' know, ma'am; I've lost one five hundred dollars from this yer place, and I can't afford to run no more risks.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What else could she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) spect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Don</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Chloe, indignantly, while the two boys, who now seemed to comprehend at once their father's destiny, clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) gown, sobbing and groaning vehemently.
<p/>George had gone to spend two or three days with a companion on a neighboring estate, and having departed early in the morning, before Tom's misfortune had been made public, had left without hearing of it.
<p/>'' I'm sorry,'' said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``that Mas'r George happened to be away. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>'' Give my love to Mas'r George,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, earnestly.
<p/>Haley whipped up the horse, and, with a steady, mournful look, fixed to the last on the old place, Tom was whirled away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had sold Tom under the spur of a driving necessity, to get out of the power of a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreaded,--and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first feeling, after the consummation of the bargain, had been that of relief.
<p/>Mr. Shelby at this time was not at home. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) wife's expostulations awoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) half-slumbering regrets; and Tom's manly disinterestedness increased the unpleasantness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>everybody did it,--and that some did it without even the excuse of necessity;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could not satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own feelings; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might not witness the unpleasant scenes of the consummation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had gone on a short business tour up the country, hoping that all would be over before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) returned.
<p/>Tom and Haley rattled on along the dusty road, whirling past every old familiar spot, until the bounds of the estate were fairly passed, and they found themselves out on the open pike.
<p/>After they had ridden about a mile, Haley suddenly drew up at the door of a blacksmith's shop, when, taking out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) a pair of handcuffs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) stepped into the shop, to have a little alteration in them.
<p/>It was in vain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) said to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) had a right to do it,--that '' These yer 's a little too small for his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) build,'' said Haley, showing the fetters, and pointing out to Tom.
<p/>'' Lor! now, if thar an't Shelby's Tom. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) han't sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), now?'' said the smith. '' Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has,'' said Haley.
<p/>'' Now, ye don't! well, reely,'' said the smith, <div class="bookquote">``who'd a thought it! Why, ye needn't go to fetterin' him (<font color='blue'><b>smith</b></font>) up this yer way.

<p/>Wal, now, a feller can't help thinkin' it's a mighty pity to have a nice, quiet, likely feller, as good un as Tom is, go down to be fairly ground up on one of them ar sugar plantations.

<p/>I'll get him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) in house-servant in some good old family, and then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) stands the fever and `climating, he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'ll have a berth good as any nigger ought ter ask for.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wal, he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'s got a fa'r chance. I promised to do well by him (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>).

<p/>'' Yes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>)'ll get another thar. Lord, thar's women enough everywhar,'' said Haley. Tom was sitting very mournfully on the outside of the shop while this conversation was going on.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard the quick, short click of a horse's hoof behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could fairly awake from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) surprise, young Master George sprang into the wagon, threw his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms tumultuously round his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) neck, and was sobbing and scolding with energy.
<p/>'' I declare, it's real mean! I don't care what they say, any of 'em! It's a nasty, mean shame! If I was a man, they shouldn't do
<p/>it,--they should not, so ! '' said George, with a kind of subdued howl. '' O! Mas'r George! this does me good!'' said Tom.
<p/>'' I couldn't bar to go off without seein' ye! It does me real good, ye can't tell!'' Here Tom made some movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feet, and George's eye fell on the fetters.
<p/>'' What a shame!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) exclaimed, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hands. '' I'll knock that old fellow down--I will!'' '' No you won't,
<p/>Mas'r George; and you must not talk so loud. It won't help me any, to anger him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).'' '' Well, I won't, then, for your sake; but only to think of it--isn't it a shame?
<p/>They never sent for me, nor sent me any word, and, if it hadn't been for Tom Lincon, I shouldn't have heard it.
<p/>I tell you, I blew 'em up well, all of 'em, at home!'' '' That ar wasn't right , I'm `feard, Mas'r George.''
<p/>Look here, Uncle Tom,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back to the shop, and speaking in a mysterious tone, <div class="bookquote">``I've brought you my dollar!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``Can't help it! I say it's a shame! <div class="bookquote">``O! I couldn't think o' takin' on `t, Mas'r George, no ways in the world!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, quite moved.
<p/>I'd do it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) advised me just to make a hole in it, and put a string through, so you could hang it round your neck, and keep it out of sight; else this mean scamp would take it away.
<p/>'' But you shall take it!'' said George; <div class="bookquote">``look here--I told Aunt Chloe I tell ye, Tom, I want to blow him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up!
<p/>Well, I won't, for your sake,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, busily tying his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dollar round Tom's neck; <div class="bookquote">``but there, now, button your coat tight over it, and keep it, and remember, every time you see it, that I'll come down after you, and bring you back.

<p/>Ye'll never see sich another woman, Mas'r George, if ye live to be a hundred years old. So, now, you hold on to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and grow up, and be a comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)

(<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I will, Uncle Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George seriously.

<p/>I's older, ye know,'' said Tom, stroking the boy's fine, curly head with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) large, strong hand, but speaking in a voice as tender as a woman's, <div class="bookquote">``and I sees all that's bound up in you.

<p/>I'll have you back to the place, yet. O, you'll have good times yet!'' Haley now came to the door, with the handcuffs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Look here, now, Mister,'' said George, with an air of great superiority, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) got out, <div class="bookquote">``I shall let father and mother know how you treat Uncle Tom!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' You're welcome,'' said the trader. '' I should think you'd be ashamed to spend all your life buying men and women, and chaining them, like cattle!
<p/>So long as your grand folks wants to buy men and women, I'm as good as they is,'' said Haley; ''`tan't any meaner sellin' on 'em
<p/>I should think you'd feel mean!'' said George. '' , that 't is buyin'!'' '' I'll never do either, when I'm a man,'' said George;
<p/>I always was proud of it before;'' and George sat very straight on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) horse, and looked round with an air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) expected the state would be impressed with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) opinion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm ashamed, this day, that I'm a Kentuckian. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle Tom</b></font>)</div>Well, good-by, Uncle Tom; keep a stiff upper lip,'' said George. ''
<p/>Good-by, Mas'r George,'' said Tom, looking fondly and admiringly at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). '' God Almighty bless you! Ah! Kentucky han't got many like you!
<p/>Away he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) went, and Tom looked, till the clatter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) horse's heels died away, the last sound or sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) home.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, in the fulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart, as the frank, boyish face was lost to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) view. But over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart there seemed to be a warm spot, where those young hands had placed that precious dollar.
<p/>Now, I tell ye what, Tom,'' said Haley, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came up to the wagon, and threw in the handcuffs, <div class="bookquote">``I mean to start fa'r with ye, as I gen`ally do with my niggers; and I'll tell ye now, to begin with

<p/>If niggers is quiet, and don't try to get off, they has good times with me; and if they don't, why, it's thar fault, and not mine.
<p/>; I an't never hard on my niggers. Calculates to do the best for 'em I can. '' Tom assured Haley that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had no present intentions of running off.
<p/>In fact, the exhortation seemed rather a superfluous one to a man with a great pair of iron fetters on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet.
<p/>But Mr. Haley had got in the habit of commencing his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) relations with his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) stock with little exhortations of this nature, calculated, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) deemed, to inspire cheerfulness and confidence, and prevent the necessity of any unpleasant scenes.
<p/>And here, for the present, we take our leave of Tom, to pursue the fortunes of other characters in our story.
<p/>It was late in a drizzly afternoon that a traveler alighted at the door of a small country hotel, in the village of N--, in Kentucky.
<p/>In the barroom he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) found assembled quite a miscellaneous company, whom stress of weather had driven to harbor, and the place presented the usual scenery of such reunions.
<p/>Great, tall, raw-boned Kentuckians, attired in hunting-shirts, and trailing their loose joints over a vast extent of territory, with the easy lounge peculiar to the race,--rifles stacked away in the corner, shot-pouches, game-bags, hunting-dogs, and little negroes, all rolled together in the corners,--were the characteristic features in the picture.
<p/>At each end of the fireplace sat a long-legged gentleman, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chair tipped back, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hat on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, and the heels of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) muddy boots reposing sublimely on the mantel-piece,--a position, we will inform our readers, decidedly favorable to the turn of reflection incident to western taverns, where travellers exhibit a decided preference for this particular mode of elevating their understandings.
<p/>Mine host, who stood behind the bar, like most of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) country men, was great of stature, good-natured and loose-jointed, with an enormous shock of hair on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, and a great tall hat on the top of that.
<p/>In fact, everybody in the room bore on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head this characteristic emblem of man's sovereignty; whether it were felt hat, palm-leaf, greasy beaver, or fine new chapeau, there it reposed with true republican independence.
<p/>CHAPTER XI In Which Property Gets into an Improper State of Mind In truth, it appeared to be the characteristic mark of every individual.
<p/>Some wore them tipped rakishly to one side--these were your men of humor, jolly, free-and-easy dogs; some had them jammed independently down over their noses--these were your hard characters, thorough men, who, when they wore their hats, wanted to wear them, and to wear them just as they had a mind to; there were those who had them set far over back--wide-awake men, who wanted a clear prospect; while careless men, who did not know, or care, how their hats sat, had them shaking about in all directions.
<p/>Divers negroes, in very free-and-easy pantaloons, and with no redundancy in the shirt line, were scuttling about, hither and thither, without bringing to pass any very particular results, except expressing a generic willingness to turn over everything in creation generally for the benefit of Mas'r and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) guests.
<p/>Add to this picture a jolly, crackling, rollicking fire, going rejoicingly up a great wide chimney,--the outer door and every window being set wide open, and the calico window-curtain flopping and snapping in a good stiff breeze of damp raw
<p/>The various hats, in fact, were quite a Shakespearean study. air,--and you have an idea of the jollities of a Kentucky tavern.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) fathers were mighty hunters,--men who lived in the woods, and slept under the free, open heavens, with the stars to hold their candles; and their descendant to this day always acts as if the house were his (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) camp,--wears
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) hat at all hours, tumbles himself about, and puts his (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) heels on the tops of chairs or mantelpieces, just as his (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) father rolled on the green sward, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) upon trees and logs,--keeps all the windows and doors open, winter and summer, that he (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) may get air enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>descendant</b></font>) great lungs,--calls everybody <div class="bookquote">``stranger,''  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>with nonchalant bonhommie , and is altogether the frankest, easiest, most jovial creature living.
<p/>Your Kentuckian of the present day is a good illustration of the doctrine of transmitted instincts and peculiarities. Into such an assembly of the free and easy our traveller entered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) was a short, thick-set man, carefully dressed, with a round, good-natured countenance, and something rather fussy and particular in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) was very careful of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) valise and umbrella, bringing them in with his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) own hands, and resisting, pertinaciously, all offers from the various servants to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) of them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) looked round the barroom with rather an anxious air, and, retreating with his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) valuables to the warmest corner, disposed them under his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) chair, sat down, and looked rather apprehensively up at the worthy whose heels illustrated the end of the mantel-piece, who was spitting from right to left, with a courage and energy rather alarming to gentlemen of weak nerves and particular habits.
<p/>'' I say, stranger, how are ye? '' said the aforesaid gentleman, firing an honorary salute of tobacco-juice in the direction of the new arrival.
<p/>'' Well, I reckon,'' was the reply of the other, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dodged, with some alarm, the threatening honor. '' Any news?'' said the respondent, taking out a strip of tobacco and a large hunting-knife from his (<font color='blue'><b>respondent</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>'' Not that I know of,'' said the man. '' Chaw? '' said the first speaker, handing the old gentleman a bit of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) tobacco, with a decidedly brotherly air.
<p/>Don't, eh?'' said the other, easily, and stowing away the morsel in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own mouth, in order to keep up the supply of tobacco-juice, for the general benefit of society.
<p/>The old gentleman uniformly gave a little start whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) long-sided brother fired in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) direction; and this being observed by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) companion, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) very good-naturedly turned his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) artillery to another quarter, and proceeded to storm one of the fire-irons with a degree of military talent fully sufficient to take a city.
<p/>'' No, thank ye --it don't agree with me,'' said the little man, edging off. '' '' What's that?'' said the old gentleman, observing some of the company formed in a group around a large handbill.
<p/>Mr. Wilson, for that was the old gentleman's name, rose up, and, after carefully adjusting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) valise and umbrella, proceeded deliberately to take out his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) spectacles and fix them on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) nose; and, this operation being performed, read as follows: ``Ran away from the subscriber, my mulatto boy, George.
<p/>Said George six feet in height, a very light mulatto, brown curly hair; is very intelligent, speaks handsomely, can read and write, will probably try to pass for a white man, is deeply scarred on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back and shoulders, has been branded in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right hand with the letter H.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will give four hundred dollars for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alive, and the same sum for satisfactory proof that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been killed.

<p/>The long-legged veteran, who had been besieging the fire-iron, as before related, now took down his (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) cumbrous length, and rearing aloft his (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) tall form, walked up to the advertisement and very deliberately spit a full discharge of tobacco-juice on it.
<p/>'' There's my mind upon that!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>), briefly, and sat down again. '' Why, now, stranger, what's that for?'' said mine host.
<p/>I'd do it all the same to the writer of that ar paper, if he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was here,'' said the long man, coolly resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old employment of cutting tobacco.
<p/>Any man that owns a boy like that, and can't find any better way o' treating on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), deserves to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' Such papers as these is a shame to Kentucky; that's my mind right out, if anybody wants to know!''
<p/>I've got a gang of boys, sir,'' said the long man, resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attack on the fire-irons, <div class="bookquote">``and I jest tells 'em--`Boys,' says I,--' run now!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Well, now, that's a fact,'' said mine host, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made an entry in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) book. '' dig! put! jest when ye want to!
<p/>I never shall come to look after you!' That's the way I keep mine. Let 'em know they are free to run any time, and it jest breaks up their wanting to.
<p/>'em all recorded, in case I gets keeled up any o' these times, and they know it; and I tell ye, stranger, there an't
<p/>More 'n all, I've got free papers for a fellow in our parts gets more out of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) niggers than I do.
<p/>Why, my boys have been to Cincinnati, with five hundred dollars' worth of colts, and brought me back the money, all straight, time and agin.
<p/>It stands to reason they should. Treat 'em like dogs, and you'll have dogs' works and dogs' actions. Treat 'em like men, and you'll have men's works.
<p/>And the honest drover, in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) warmth, endorsed this moral sentiment by firing a perfect feu de joi at the fireplace.
<p/>'' '' I think you're altogether right, friend,'' said Mr. Wilson; ``and this boy described here is a fine fellow--no mistake about that.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is an ingenious fellow, too: he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) invented a machine for the cleaning of hemp--a really valuable affair; it's gone into use in several factories.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) worked for me some half-dozen years in my bagging factory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was my best hand, sir. His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) master holds the patent of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll warrant ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>the drover</b></font>)</div>said the drover, ``holds it and makes money out of it, and then turns round and brands the boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) right hand.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``These yer knowin' boys is allers aggravatin' and sarcy,''  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>said a coarse-looking fellow, from the other side of the room; <div class="bookquote">``that's why they gets cut up and marked so.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>If I had a fair chance, I'd mark him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), I reckon so that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d carry it one while.'' If they behaved themselves, they wouldn't.
<p/>That is to say, the Lord made 'em men, and it's a hard squeeze gettin 'em down into beasts,'' said the drover, dryly.
<p/>Bright niggers isn't no kind of `vantage to their masters,'' continued the other, well entrenched, in a coarse, unconscious obtuseness, from the contempt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) opponent;
<p/>'' '' '' ``what's the use o' talents and them things, if you can't get the use on 'em yourself? Why, all the use they make on 't is to get round you.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better send orders up to the Lord, to make you a set, and leave out their souls entirely,''  (<font color='red'><b>the drover</b></font>)</div>said the drover.
<p/>'' Here the conversation was interrupted by the approach of a small one-horse buggy to the inn. It had a genteel appearance, and a well-dressed, gentlemanly man sat on the seat, with a colored servant driving.
<p/>The whole party examined the new comer with the interest with which a set of loafers in a rainy day usually examine every newcomer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) was very tall, with a dark, Spanish complexion, fine, expressive black eyes, and close-curling hair, also of a glossy blackness.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) well-formed aquiline nose, straight thin lips, and the admirable contour of his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) finely-formed limbs, impressed the whole company instantly with the idea of something uncommon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) walked easily in among the company, and with a nod indicated to his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) waiter where to place his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) trunk, bowed to the company, and, with his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) hand, walked up leisurely to the bar, and gave in his (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) name as Henry Butter, Oaklands, Shelby County.
<p/>Jim,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) man, <div class="bookquote">``seems to me we met a boy something like this, up at Beman's, didn't we?''
 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>Turning, with an indifferent air, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) sauntered up to the advertisement, and read it over. '' '' Yes, Mas`r,'' said Jim, <div class="bookquote">``only I an't sure about the hand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Crow</b></font>)</div><p/>Then walking up to the landlord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) to furnish him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) with a private apartment, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had some writing to do immediately.
<p/>The landlord was all obsequious, and a relay of about seven negroes, old and young, male and female, little and big, were soon whizzing about, like a covey of partridges, bustling, hurrying, treading on each other's toes, and tumbling over each other, in their zeal to get Mas`r's room ready, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) seated himself easily on a chair in the middle of the room, and entered into conversation with the man who sat next to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The manufacturer, Mr. Wilson, from the time of the entrance of the stranger, had regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) with an air of disturbed and uneasy curiosity.
<p/>'' Well, I didn't look, of course,'' said the stranger with a careless yawn. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) seemed to himself to have met and been acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) somewhere, but he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could not recollect.
<p/>Every few moments, when the man spoke, or moved, or smiled, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would start and fix his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and then suddenly withdraw them, as the bright, dark eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with such unconcerned coolness.
<p/>At last, a sudden recollection seemed to flash upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared at the stranger with such an air of blank amazement and alarm, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' Mr. Wilson, I think,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>), in a tone of recognition, and extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) hand. '' I beg your pardon, I didn't recollect you before.
<p/>I see you remember me,--Mr. Butler, of Oaklands, Shelby County.'' '' Ye--yes--yes, sir,'' said Mr. Wilson, like one speaking in a dream.
<p/>Jim, see to the trunks,'' said the gentleman, negligently; then addressing himself to Mr. Wilson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) added--<div class="bookquote">``I should like to have a few moments' conversation with you on business, in my room, if you please.
<p/>Mr. Wilson followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>), as one who walks in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) sleep; and they proceeded to a large upper chamber, where a new-made fire was crackling, and various servants flying about, putting finishing touches to the arrangements.
<p/>When all was done, and the servants departed, the young man deliberately locked the door, and putting the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, faced about, and folding his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom, looked Mr. Wilson full in the face.
<p/>Just then a negro boy entered, and announced that Mas`r's room was ready. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' George!'' said Mr. Wilson. ''
<p/>Yes, George,'' said the young man. '' I couldn't have thought it!'' <div class="bookquote">``I am pretty well disguised, I fancy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, with a smile.
<p/>'' A little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown, and I've dyed my hair black; so you see I don't answer to the advertisement at all.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, George! but this is a dangerous game you are playing. I could not have advised you to it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can do it on my own responsibility,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, with the same proud smile.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother was one of those unfortunates of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) race, marked out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) possessor, and the mother of children who may never know a father.
<p/>From one of the proudest families in Kentucky he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had inherited a set of fine European features, and a high, indomitable spirit.
<p/>We remark, en passant , that George was, by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) father's side, of white descent. From his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had received only a slight mulatto tinge, amply compensated by its accompanying rich, dark eye.
<p/>A slight change in the tint of the skin and the color of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hair had metamorphosed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) into the Spanish-looking fellow he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) then appeared; and as gracefulness of movement and gentlemanly manners had always been perfectly natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) found no difficulty in playing the bold part he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had adopted--that of a gentleman travelling with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) domestic.
<p/>Mr. Wilson, a good-natured but extremely fidgety and cautious old gentleman, ambled up and down the room, appearing, as John Bunyan hath it, <div class="bookquote">``much tumbled up and down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunyan</b></font>) mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Bunyan/Bunyan</b></font>)</div>and divided between his (<font color='blue'><b>Bunyan</b></font>) wish to help George, and a certain confused notion of maintaining law and order: so, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shambled about, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) delivered himself as follows:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, George, I s`pose you're running away--leaving your lawful master, George---LRB-I don't wonder at it-RRB---at the same time , I'm sorry, George,--yes, decidedly--I think I must say that, George--it's my duty to tell you so.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why are you sorry, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, calmly. '' Why, to see you, as it were, setting yourself in opposition to the laws of your country.
<p/>'' '' My country!'' said George, with a strong and bitter emphasis; <div class="bookquote">``what country have I, but the grave,--and I wish to God that I was laid there!''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, George, no--no--it won't do; this way of talking is wicked--unscriptural. George, you've got a hard master--in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is-- well he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) conducts himself reprehensibly
<p/>But you know how the angel commanded Hagar to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mistress, and submit herself under the hand;* and the apostle sent back Onesimus to his (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>) master.
<p/>--I can't pretend to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>* * * Gen. 16. The angel bade the pregnant Hagar return to her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mistress Sarai, even though Sarai had dealt harshly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarai</b></font>).
<p/>* * Phil. 1:10. Onesimus went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phil</b></font>) master to become no longer a servant but a <div class="bookquote">``brother beloved.''  (<font color='red'><b>a servant brother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't quote Bible at me that way, Mr. Wilson,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, with a flashing eye, <div class="bookquote">``don't!
<p/>for my wife is a Christian, and I mean to be, if ever I get to where I can; but to quote Bible to a fellow in my circumstances, is enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) give it up altogether.
<p/>I appeal to God Almighty;--I'm willing to go with the case to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>), and ask Him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) if I do wrong to seek my freedom.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>'' These feelings are quite natural, George,'' said the good-natured man, blowing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nose. '' Yes, they're natural, but it is my duty not to encourage 'em in you.
<p/>Yes, my boy, I'm sorry for you, now; it's a bad case--very bad; but the apostle says, `Let everyone abide in the condition in which he (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>) is called.'
<p/>George stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head drawn back, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arms folded tightly over his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) broad breast, and a bitter smile curling his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) lips.
<p/>I wonder, Mr. Wilson, if the Indians should come and take you a prisoner away from your wife and children, and want to keep you all your life hoeing corn for them, if you'd think it your duty to abide in the condition in which you were called.
<p/>We must all submit to the indications of Providence, George,--don't you see?'' '' I rather think that you'd think the first stray horse you could find an indication of Providence--shouldn't you?
<p/>The little old gentleman stared with both eyes at this illustration of the case; but, though not much of a reasoner, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had the sense in which some logicians on this particular subject do not excel,--that of saying nothing, where nothing could be said.
<p/>So, as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stood carefully stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) umbrella, and folding and patting down all the creases in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) proceeded on with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) exhortations in a general way.
<p/>You see, George, you know, now, I always have stood your friend; and whatever I've said, I've said for your good.
<p/>If you're taken, it will be worse with you than ever; they'll only abuse you, and half kill you, and sell you down the river.''
<p/>'' '' Now, here, it seems to me, you're running an awful risk. You can't hope to carry it out. ''
<p/>Mr. Wilson, I know all this,'' said George. '' I do run a risk, but-- '' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) threw open his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) overcoat, and showed two pistols and a bowie-knife.
<p/>No! if it comes to that, I can earn myself at least six feet of free soil,--the first and last I shall ever own in Kentucky!''
<p/>'' There!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said, ``I'm ready for 'em! Down south I never will go. <div class="bookquote">``Why, George, this state of mind is awful; it's getting really desperate George.
<p/>Mr. Wilson, you have a country; but what country have I , or any one like me, born of slave mothers?
<p/>We don't make them,--we don't consent to them,--we have nothing to do with them; all they do for us is to crush us, and keep us down.
<p/>I'm concerned. Going to break the laws of your country!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' My country again! What laws are there for us? Haven't I heard your Fourth-of-July speeches?
<p/>Don't you tell us all, once a year, that governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed? Can't a fellow think , that hears such things?
<p/>Mr. Wilson's mind was one of those that may not unaptly be represented by a bale of cotton,--downy, soft, benevolently fuzzy and confused.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) really pitied George with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) heart, and had a sort of dim and cloudy perception of the style of feeling that agitated him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) deemed it his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) duty to go on talking good to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>), with infinite pertinacity.
<p/>I must tell you, you know, as a friend, you'd better not be meddling with such notions; they are bad, George, very bad, for boys in your condition,--very;'' and Mr. Wilson sat down to a table, and began nervously chewing the handle of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) umbrella.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See here, now, Mr. Wilson,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, coming up and sitting himself determinately down in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``look at me, now.
<p/>Can't he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) put this and that together, and see what it comes to? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' George, this is bad. Don't I sit before you, every way, just as much a man as you are?
<p/>Look at my face,--look at my hands,--look at my body,'' and the young man drew himself up proudly; <div class="bookquote">``why am I not a man, as much as anybody?
<p/>I had a father--one of your Kentucky gentlemen--who didn't think enough of me to keep me from being sold with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dogs and horses, to satisfy the estate, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died.
<p/>Well, Mr. Wilson, hear what I can tell you. I saw my mother put up at sheriff's sale, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seven children.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came and kneeled down before old Mas`r, and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with me, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might have at least one child with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) kicked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) away with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) heavy boot.
<p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) do it; and the last that I heard was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) moans and screams, when I was tied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) horse's neck, to be carried off to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>They were sold before her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes, one by one, all to different masters; and I was the youngest. '' Well, then?''
<p/>'' My master traded with one of the men, and bought my oldest sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a pious, good girl,--a member of the Baptist church,--and as handsome as my poor mother had been.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was well brought up, and had good manners. At first, I was glad she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was bought, for I had one friend near me.
<p/>Sir, I have stood at the door and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whipped, when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked heart, and I couldn't do anything to help her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was whipped, sir, for wanting to live a decent Christian life, such as your laws give no slave girl a right to live; and at last I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chained with a trader's gang, to be sent to market in Orleans,--sent there for nothing else
<p/>Well, I grew up,--long years and years,--no father, no mother, no sister, not a living soul that cared for me more than a dog; nothing but whipping, scolding, starving.
<p/>Why, sir, I've been so hungry that I have been glad to take the bones they threw to their dogs; and yet, when I was a little fellow, and laid awake whole nights and cried, it wasn't the hunger, it wasn't the whipping, I cried for.
<p/>I was soon sorry for it. but that,--and that's the last I know of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). No, sir, it was for my mother and my sisters
<p/>,--it was because I hadn't a friend to love me on earth. I never knew what peace or comfort was. I never had a kind word spoken to me till I came to work in your factory.
<p/>Mr. Wilson, you treated me well; you encouraged me to do well, and to learn to read and write, and to try to make something of myself; and God knows how grateful I am for it.
<p/>When I found she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loved me, when I married her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), I scarcely could believe I was alive, I was so happy; and, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is as good as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is beautiful.
<p/>Why, now comes my master, takes me right away from my work, and my friends, and all I like, and grinds me down into the very dirt!
<p/>Then, sir, I found my wife; you've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),--you know how beautiful she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is. But now what? And why? Because, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) says, I forgot who I was; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) says, to teach me that I am only a nigger!
<p/>After all, and last of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) comes between me and my wife, and says I shall give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up, and live with another woman.
<p/>And all this your laws give him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) power to do, in spite of God or man. Mr. Wilson, look at it!
<p/>There isn't one of all these things, that have broken the hearts of my mother and my sister, and my wife and myself, but your laws allow, and give every man power to do, in Kentucky, and none can say to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nay!
<p/>Do you call these the laws of my country? Sir, I haven't any country, anymore than I have any father. But I'm going to have one.
<p/>I don't want anything of your country, except to be let alone,--to go peaceably out of it; and when I get to Canada, where the laws will own me and protect me, that shall be my country, and its laws I will obey.
<p/>But if any man tries to stop me, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) take care, for I am desperate. I'll fight for my liberty to the last breath I breathe.
<p/>This speech, delivered partly while sitting at the table, and partly walking up and down the room,--delivered with tears, and flashing eyes, and despairing gestures,--was altogether too much for the good-natured old body to whom it was addressed, who had pulled out a great yellow silk pocket-handkerchief, and was mopping up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face with great energy.
<p/>You say your fathers did it; if it was right for them, it is right for me!'' '' Blast 'em all!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly broke out. '' Haven't I always said so-- the infernal old cusses! I hope I an't swearing, now.
<p/>Well! go ahead, George, go ahead; but be careful, my boy; don't shoot anybody, George, unless--well--you'd better not shoot, I reckon;
<p/>at least, I wouldn't hit anybody, you know. Where is your wife, George?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) added, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) nervously rose, and began walking the room.
<p/>Gone, sir gone, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) child in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms, the Lord only knows where;--gone after the north star; and when we ever meet, or whether we meet at all in this world, no creature can tell.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Kind families get in debt, and the laws of our country allow them to sell the child out of its mother's bosom to pay its master's debts,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, bitterly.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Is it possible! astonishing! from such a kind family?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' Well, well,'' said the honest old man, fumbling in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket: <div class="bookquote">``I s`pose, perhaps,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, suddenly; <div class="bookquote">``so here, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and, taking out a roll of bills from his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pocket-book, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) offered them to George.
<p/>I an't following my judgment,--hang it , I won't follow my judgment! '' No, my kind, good sir! '' said George, <div class="bookquote">``you've done a great deal for me, and this might get you into trouble.
<p/>I have money enough, I hope, to take me as far as I need it.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>'' No; but you must, George.
<p/>Money is a great help everywhere;--can't have too much, if you get it honestly. Take it,-- do take it, now ,--do, my boy!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On condition, sir, that I may repay it at some future time, I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, taking up the money. ''
<p/>And now, George, how long are you going to travel in this way?--not long or far, I hope. It's well carried on, but too bold.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heard, after he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) got there, that his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) master was so angry at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) for going off that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had whipped his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) poor old mother; and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has come all the way back to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and get a chance to get her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) away.''
<p/>And this black fellow,--who is he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?'' ``A true fellow, who went to Canada more than a year ago. <div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is going with me as far as Ohio, to put me among friends that helped him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will come back after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has been hanging about the place, and found no chance yet. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Dangerous, very dangerous!'' said the old man.
<p/>George drew himself up, and smiled disdainfully. The old gentleman eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) from head to foot, with a sort of innocent wonder.
<p/>'' George, something has brought you out wonderfully. You hold up your head, and speak and move like another man,'' said Mr. Wilson.
<p/>'' Because I'm a freeman !'' said George, proudly. '' Yes, sir; I've said Mas'r for the last time to any man.
<p/>I'm free!'' <div class="bookquote">``Take care! You are not sure,--you may be taken. ''  (<font color='red'><b>All men</b></font>)</div>'' All men are free and equal in the grave , if it comes to that, Mr. Wilson,'' said George.
<p/>Mr. Wilson, it is so bold, and this tavern is so near, that they will never think of it; they will look for me on ahead, and you yourself wouldn't know me.
<p/>'' I'm perfectly dumb-founded with your boldness!'' said Mr. Wilson,--<div class="bookquote">``to come right here to the nearest tavern!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wilson</b></font>)</div>'' Jim's master don't live in this county; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) isn't known in these parts.
<p/>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is given up; nobody is looking after him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and nobody will take me up from the advertisement, I think.
<p/>'' '' But the mark in your hand? '' George drew off his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) glove, and showed a newly-healed scar in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand.
<p/>A fortnight ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) took it into his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head to give it to me, because he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) believed I should try to get away one of these days.
<p/>'' That is a parting proof of Mr. Harris' regard,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) said, scornfully. '' Looks interesting, doesn't it?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) said, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) glove on again.
<p/>'' I declare, my very blood runs cold when I think of it,--your condition and your risks!'' said Mr. Wilson. ''
<p/>Mine has run cold a good many years, Mr. Wilson; at present, it's about up to the boiling point,'' said George.
<p/>Well, my good sir,'' continued George, after a few moments' silence, <div class="bookquote">``I saw you knew me; I thought I'd just have this talk with you, lest your surprised looks should bring me out.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>I leave early tomorrow morning, before daylight; by tomorrow night I hope to sleep safe in Ohio. I shall travel by daylight, stop at the best hotels, go to the dinner-tables with the lords of the land.
<p/>So, good-by, sir; if you hear that I'm taken, you may know that I'm dead!'' George stood up like a rock, and put out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand with the air of a prince.
<p/>The friendly little old man shook it heartily, and after a little shower of caution, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) umbrella, and fumbled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way out of the room.
<p/>George stood thoughtfully looking at the door, as the old man closed it. A thought seemed to flash across his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mind.
<p/>The old gentleman entered again, and George, as before, locked the door, and then stood for a few moments looking on the floor, irresolutely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hastily stepped to it, and opening it, said, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Wilson, one word more.

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>There isn't, on earth, a living soul to care if I die,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) added, drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) breath hard, and speaking with a great effort,--<div class="bookquote">``I shall be kicked out and buried like a dog, and nobody'll think of it a day after,-- only my poor wife!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well, George. '' '' Well, sir,--what you said was true. I am running a dreadful risk.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gave it to me for a Christmas present, poor child! Give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to the last.
<p/>Will you? Will you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) added, earnestly. '' Yes, certainly--poor fellow! '' said the old gentleman, taking the pin, with watery eyes, and a melancholy quiver in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) one thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George; <div class="bookquote">``it's my last wish, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) can get to Canada, to go there.

Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to bring up our boy a free man, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) won't suffer as I have.

<p/>'' Is there a God to trust in?'' said George, in such a tone of bitter despair as arrested the old gentleman's words.
<p/>Trust in the Lord, George. I wish in my heart you were safe through, though,--that's what I do.'' '' O, I've seen things all my life that have made me feel that there can't be a God.
<p/>You Christians don't know how these things look to us. There's a God for you, but is there any for us?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, now, don't--don't, my boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the old man, almost sobbing as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke; ``don't feel so!

<p/>The real piety and benevolence of the simple old man invested him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with a temporary dignity and authority, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>George stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) distracted walk up and down the room, stood thoughtfully a moment, and then said, quietly, <div class="bookquote">``Thank you for saying that, my good friend; I'll think of that .''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>In Ramah there was a voice heard,--weeping, and lamentation, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) children, and would not be comforted.
<p/>'' CHAPTER XII Select Incident of Lawful Trade '' '' * * Jer. 31:15. Mr. Haley and Tom jogged onward in their wagon, each, for a time, absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) own reflections.
<p/>Now, the reflections of two men sitting side by side are a curious thing,--seated on the same seat, having the same eyes, ears, hands and organs of all sorts, and having pass before their eyes the same objects,--it is wonderful what a variety we shall find in these same reflections!
<p/>As, for example, Mr. Haley: he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) thought first of Tom's length, and breadth, and height, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) would sell for, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was kept fat and in good case till he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) into market.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) thought of how he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) should make out his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) gang; he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) thought of the respective market value of certain supposititious men and women and children who were to compose it, and other kindred topics of the business; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) thought of himself, and how humane he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was, that whereas other men chained their <div class="bookquote">``niggers''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>hand and foot both, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) only put fetters on the feet, and left Tom the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) behaved well; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sighed to think how ungrateful human nature was, so that there was even room to doubt whether Tom appreciated his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mercies.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been taken in so by <div class="bookquote">``niggers''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had favored; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was astonished to consider how good-natured he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) yet remained!
<p/>As to Tom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was thinking over some words of an unfashionable old book, which kept running through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head, again and again, as follows: ``We have here no continuing city, but we seek one to come; wherefore God himself is not ashamed to be called our God; for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hath prepared for us a city.
<p/>These words of an ancient volume, got up principally by <div class="bookquote">``ignorant and unlearned men,''  (<font color='red'><b>fellows</b></font>)</div>have, through all time, kept up, somehow, a strange sort of power over the minds of poor, simple fellows, like Tom.
<p/>They stir up the soul from its depths, and rouse, as with trumpet call, courage, energy, and enthusiasm, where before was only the blackness of despair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not a remarkably fluent reader, and was in the habit of reading in a sort of recitative half-aloud, by way of calling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ears to verify the deductions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Mr. Haley pulled out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) pocket sundry newspapers, and began looking over their advertisements, with absorbed interest. In this tone he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) slowly recited the following paragraph:
<p/>``EXECUTOR'S SALE,--NEGROES!--Agreeably to order of court, will be sold, on Tuesday, February 20, before the Court-house door, in the town of Washington, Kentucky,
<p/>Sold for the benefit of the creditors and heirs of the estate of Jesse Blutchford, <div class="bookquote">``SAMUEL MORRIS, THOMAS FLINT, Executors .''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jesse</b></font>)</div><p/>the following negroes: Hagar, aged 60; John, aged 30; Ben, aged 21; Saul, aged 25; Albert, aged 14. '' This yer I must look at,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Albert</b></font>) to Tom, for want of somebody else to talk to.
<p/>'' Ye see, I'm going to get up a prime gang to take down with ye, Tom; it'll make it sociable and pleasant like,--good company will, ye know.
<p/>We must drive right to Washington first and foremost, and then I'll clap you into jail, while I does the business.
<p/>Tom received this agreeable intelligence quite meekly; simply wondering, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own heart, how many of these doomed men had wives and children, and whether they would feel as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did about leaving them.
<p/>It is to be confessed, too, that the naive, off-hand information that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was to be thrown into jail by no means produced an agreeable impression on a poor fellow who had always prided himself on a strictly honest and upright course of life.
<p/>Yes, Tom, we must confess it, was rather proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) honesty, poor fellow,--not having very much else to be proud of;--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had belonged to some of the higher walks of society, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), perhaps, would never have been reduced to such straits.
<p/>However, the day wore on, and the evening saw Haley and Tom comfortably accommodated in Washington,--the one in a tavern, and the other in a jail.
<p/>About eleven o'clock the next day, a mixed throng was gathered around the court-house steps,--smoking, chewing, spitting, swearing, and conversing, according to their respective tastes and turns,--waiting for the auction to commence.
<p/>'' The men and women to be sold sat in a group apart, talking in a low tone to each other.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) might have been sixty, but was older than that by hard work and disease, was partially blind, and somewhat crippled with rheumatism.
<p/>The woman who had been advertised by the name of Hagar was a regular African in feature and figure. By her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side stood her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only remaining son, Albert, a bright-looking little fellow of fourteen years.
<p/>The boy was the only survivor of a large family, who had been successively sold away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to a southern market.
<p/>The mother held on to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) with both her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shaking hands, and eyed with intense trepidation every one who walked up to examine him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>Don't be feard, Aunt Hagar,'' said the oldest of the men, <div class="bookquote">``I spoke to Mas'r Thomas `bout it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might manage to sell you in a lot both together.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Dey needn't call me worn out yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shaking hands. '' I can cook yet, and scrub, and scour,--I'm wuth a buying, if I do come
<p/>Haley here forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) way into the group, walked up to the old man, pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) mouth open and looked in, felt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) teeth, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) stand and straighten himself, bend his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) back, and perform various evolutions to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) muscles; and then passed on to the next, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) through the same trial.
<p/>Walking up last to the boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) felt of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms, straightened his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands, and looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fingers, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) jump, to show his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) agility.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) an't gwine to be sold widout me!'' said the old woman, with passionate eagerness; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) and I goes in a lot together; I 's rail strong yet, Mas'r and can do heaps o'
<p/>cheap;--tell em dat ar,--you tell em,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, earnestly. '' work,--heaps on it, Mas`r.'' <div class="bookquote">``On plantation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, with a contemptuous glance.
<p/>Likely story!'' and, as if satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) examination, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) walked out and looked, and stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) pocket, his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) mouth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) hat cocked on one side, ready for action.
<p/>What think of 'em?'' said a man who had been following Haley's examination, as if to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) own mind from it.
<p/>'' '' '' Wal,'' said Haley, spitting, <div class="bookquote">``I shall put in, I think, for the youngerly ones and the boy.''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>They want to sell the boy and the old woman together,'' said the man. '' Find it a tight pull;--why, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s an old rack o' bones,--not worth her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) salt.
<p/>'' '' You wouldn't then?'' said the man. '' Anybody 'd be a fool 't would. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s half blind, crooked with rheumatis, and foolish to boot.
<p/>'' '' Some buys up these yer old critturs, and ses there's a sight more wear in 'em than a body 'd think,'' said the man, reflectively.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wal, 't is kinder pity, now, not to buy her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son,--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart seems so sot on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>),--s`pose they fling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in cheap.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No go, 't all,'' said Haley; <div class="bookquote">``wouldn't take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for a present,--fact,--I've seen , now.''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>'' Them that's got money to spend that ar way
<p/>I shall bid off on that ar boy for a plantation-hand;--wouldn't be bothered with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), no way, not if they'd give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to me,'' said Haley.
<p/>, it's all well enough. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll take on desp`t,'' said the man. '' Nat`lly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will,'' said the trader, coolly.
<p/>The conversation was here interrupted by a busy hum in the audience; and the auctioneer, a short, bustling, important fellow, elbowed his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) way into the crowd.
<p/>The old woman drew in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breath, and caught instinctively at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son. '' Keep close to yer mammy, Albert,--close,--dey'll put us up togedder,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' O, mammy , I'm feard they won't,'' said the boy. '' Dey must, child; I can't live, no ways, if they don't'' said the old creature, vehemently.
<p/>The stentorian tones of the auctioneer, calling out to clear the way, now announced that the sale was about to commence.
<p/>The different men on the list were soon knocked off at prices which showed a pretty brisk demand in the market; two of them fell to Haley.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, now, young un,''  (<font color='red'><b>the auctioneer</b></font>)</div>said the auctioneer, giving the boy a touch with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hammer, <div class="bookquote">``be up and show your springs, now.
<p/>A place was cleared, and the bidding began. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Put us two up togedder, togedder,--do please, Mas`r,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, holding fast to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) boy.
<p/>Now, darkey, spring;'' and, with the word, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pushed the boy toward the block, while a deep, heavy groan rose behind him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>The boy paused, and looked back; but there was no time to stay, and, dashing the tears from his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) large, bright eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was up in a moment.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fine figure, alert limbs, and bright face, raised an instant competition, and half a dozen bids simultaneously met the ear of the auctioneer.
<p/>Anxious, half-frightened, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked from side to side, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) heard the clatter of contending bids,--now here, now there,--till the hammer fell.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was pushed from the block toward his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) new master, but stopped one moment, and looked back, when his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) poor old mother, trembling in every limb, held out her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shaking hands toward him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' Be off,'' said the man, gruffly, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands away; <div class="bookquote">``you come last. Haley had got him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Buy me too, Mas`r, for de dear Lord's sake!--buy me,--I shall die if you don't!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll die if I do, that's the kink of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley,--<div class="bookquote">``no! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) heel. The bidding for the poor old creature was summary.
<p/>The man who had addressed Haley, and who seemed not destitute of compassion, bought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for a trifle, and the spectators began to disperse.
<p/>The poor victims of the sale, who had been brought up in one place together for years, gathered round the despairing old mother, whose agony was pitiful to see.
<p/>'' Couldn't dey leave me one? Mas'r allers said I should have one,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) did,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) repeated over and over, in heart-broken tones.
<p/>'' Trust in the Lord, Aunt Hagar,'' said the oldest of the men, sorrowfully. '' What good will it do?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), sobbing passionately.
<p/>'' Mother, mother,--don't! don't!'' said the boy. '' They say you 's got a good master.'' ``I don't care,--I don't care.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) off, can't some of ye?''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, dryly; <div class="bookquote">``don't do no good for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to go on that ar way.
<p/>The old men of the company, partly by persuasion and partly by force, loosed the poor creature's last despairing hold, and, as they led her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) off to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) new master's wagon, strove to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) three purchases together, and producing a bundle of handcuffs, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) proceeded to put on their wrists; and fastening each handcuff to a long chain, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) drove them before him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) to the jail.
<p/>O, Albert! oh, my boy! you 's my last baby. Lord, how ken I?'' '' '' A few days saw Haley, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) possessions, safely deposited on one of the Ohio boats.
<p/>It was the commencement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) gang, to be augmented, as the boat moved on, by various other merchandise of the same kind, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>), or his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) agent, had stored for him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) in various points along shore.
<p/>The La Belle Riviere, as brave and beautiful a boat as ever walked the waters of her (<font color='blue'><b>Belle</b></font>) namesake river, was floating gayly down the stream, under a brilliant sky, the stripes and stars of free America waving and fluttering over head;
<p/>All was full of life, buoyant and rejoicing;--all but Haley's gang, who were stored, with other freight, on the lower deck, and who, somehow, did not seem to appreciate their various privileges, as they sat in a knot, talking to each other in low tones.
<p/>the guards crowded with well-dressed ladies and gentlemen walking and enjoying the delightful day. '' Boys,'' said Haley, coming up, briskly, <div class="bookquote">``I hope you keep up good heart, and are cheerful.
<p/>Now, no sulks, ye see; keep stiff upper lip, boys; do well by me, and I'll do well by you. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mas`r,''  (<font color='red'><b>ages watchword</b></font>)</div>for ages the watchword of poor Africa; but it's to be owned they did not look particularly cheerful; they had their various little prejudices in favor of wives, mothers, sisters, and children, seen for the last time,--and though <div class="bookquote">``they that wasted them required of them mirth,''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>it was not instantly forthcoming.
<p/>I've got a wife,'' spoke out the article enumerated as <div class="bookquote">``John, aged thirty,''  (<font color='red'><b>a wife</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chained hand on Tom's knee,--<div class="bookquote">``and
<p/>The boys addressed responded the invariable ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) don't know a word about this, poor girl!'' <div class="bookquote">``Where does she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) live?''

<p/>In a tavern a piece down here,'' said John; <div class="bookquote">``I wish, now, I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) once more in this world,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Bunyan/Bunyan</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) added.
<p/>It was rather natural; and the tears that fell, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) spoke, came as naturally as if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been a white man.
<p/>'' Poor John! Tom drew a long breath from a sore heart, and tried, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) poor way, to comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>And over head, in the cabin, sat fathers and mothers, husbands and wives; and merry, dancing children moved round among them, like so many little butterflies, and everything was going on quite easy and comfortable.
<p/>O, mamma,'' said a boy, who had just come up from below, <div class="bookquote">``there's a negro trader on board, and he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>)'s brought four or five slaves down there.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a boy</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Poor creatures!''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother, in a tone between grief and indignation. '' What's that?'' said another lady. ''
<p/>Some poor slaves below,'' said the mother. '' And they've got chains on,'' said the boy. '' What a shame to our country that such sights are to be seen!'' said another lady.
<p/>O, there's a great deal to be said on both sides of the subject,'' said a genteel woman, who sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) state-room door sewing, while her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little girl and boy were playing round her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>I've been south, and I must say I think the negroes are better off than they would be to be free.
<p/>'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``In some respects, some of them are well off, I grant,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady to whose remark she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had answered.
<p/>The most dreadful part of slavery, to my mind, is its outrages on the feelings and affections,--the separating of families, for example.''
<p/>That is a bad thing, certainly,'' said the other lady, holding up a baby's dress she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had just completed, and looking intently on its trimmings; ``but then, I fancy, it don't occur often.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, it does,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the first lady, eagerly; ``I've lived many years in Kentucky and Virginia both, and I've seen enough to make any one's heart sick.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We can't reason from our feelings to those of this class of persons,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the other lady, sorting out some worsteds on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lap.
<p/>'' '' '' Suppose, ma'am, your two children, there, should be taken from you, and sold?'' '' Indeed, ma'am, you can know nothing of them, if you say so,'' answered the first lady, warmly.
<p/>'' I was born and brought up among them. I know they do feel, just as keenly,--even more so, perhaps,--as we do.
<p/>'' yawned, and looked out the cabin window, and finally repeated, for a finale, the remark with which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had begun,--<div class="bookquote">``After all, I think they are better off than they would be to be free.
<p/>It's undoubtedly the intention of Providence that the African race should be servants,--kept in a low condition,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said a grave-looking gentleman in black, a clergyman, seated by the cabin door.
<p/>'' The lady said <div class="bookquote">``Indeed! ''  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>'' '' `Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) be,' the scripture says.
<p/>This is what Noah says when he (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) wakes out of drunkenness and realizes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) youngest son, Ham, father of Canaan, has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Noah</b></font>) naked.
<p/>'' * * Gen. 9:25. '' I say, stranger, is that ar what that text means? '' said a tall man, standing by.
<p/>It pleased Providence, for some inscrutable reason, to doom the race to bondage, ages ago; and we must not set up our opinion against that.
<p/>Well, then, we'll all go ahead and buy up niggers,'' said the man, <div class="bookquote">``if that's the way of Providence,--won't we, Squire?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>), turning to Haley, who had been standing, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) pockets, by the stove and intently listening to the conversation.
<p/>'' Undoubtedly. '' '' '' Yes,'' continued the tall man, <div class="bookquote">``we must all be resigned to the decrees of Providence. Niggers must be sold, and trucked round, and kept under; it's what they's made for. '
<p/>Pears like this yer view 's quite refreshing, an't it, stranger? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to Haley. '' I never thought on `t,'' said Haley, <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't have said as much, myself;
<p/>I took up the trade just to make a living; if `tan't right, I calculated to `pent on 't in time, ye know.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><p/>I ha`nt no larning. '' And now you'll save yerself the trouble, won't ye?'' said the tall man. '' See what 't is, now, to know scripture.
<p/>If ye'd only studied yer Bible, like this yer good man, ye might have know'd it before, and saved ye a heap o' trouble.
<p/>And the stranger, who was no other than the honest drover whom we introduced to our readers in the Kentucky tavern, sat down, and began smoking, with a curious smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) long, dry face.
<p/>A tall, slender young man, with a face expressive of great feeling and intelligence, here broke in, and repeated the words, '''
<p/>Ye could jist have said, `Cussed be'--what's his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name?--`and ' t would all have come right.' '' All things whatsoever ye
<p/>would that men should do unto you, do ye even so unto them.' I suppose,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, '' that is scripture, as much as `Cursed be Canaan.'''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wal, it seems quite as plain a text, stranger,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Bunyan/Bunyan</b></font>)</div>said John the drover, <div class="bookquote">``to poor fellows like us, now;''  (<font color='red'><b>John the drover</b></font>)</div>and John smoked on like a volcano.
<p/>The young man paused, looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to say more, when suddenly the boat stopped, and the company made the usual steamboat rush, to see where they were landing.
<p/>'' Both them ar chaps parsons?'' said John to one of the men, as they were going out. The man nodded.
<p/>As the boat stopped, a black woman came running wildly up the plank, darted into the crowd, flew up to where the slave gang sat, and threw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms round that unfortunate piece of merchandise before enumerate--<div class="bookquote">``John, aged thirty,''  (<font color='red'><b>the slave gang</b></font>)</div>and with sobs and tears bemoaned him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband.
<p/>But what needs tell the story, told too oft,--every day told,--of heart-strings rent and broken,--the weak broken and torn for the profit and convenience of the strong!
<p/>It needs not to be told;--every day is telling it,--telling it, too, in the ear of One who is not deaf, though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) be long silent.
<p/>The young man who had spoken for the cause of humanity and God before stood with folded arms, looking on this scene.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turned, and Haley was standing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) side. '' My friend,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) said, speaking with thick utterance, <div class="bookquote">``how can you, how dare you, carry on a trade like this?
<p/>Here I am, rejoicing in my heart that I am going home to my wife and child; and the same bell which is a signal to carry me onward towards them will part this poor man and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife forever.
<p/>Look at those poor creatures! Depend upon it, God will bring you into judgment for this. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The trader turned away in silence.
<p/>'' I say, now,'' said the drover, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) elbow, <div class="bookquote">``there's differences in parsons, an't there? ' Cussed be Canaan' don't seem to go down with this `un, does it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the drover</b></font>)</div><p/>And that ar an't the worst on `t,'' said John; <div class="bookquote">``mabbee it won't go down with the Lord, neither, when ye come to settle with Him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), one o' these days, as all on us must, I reckon.
<p/>If I make pretty handsomely on one or two next gangs,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Bunyan/Bunyan</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">``I reckon I'll stop off this yer; it's really getting dangerous.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pocket-book, and began adding over his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) accounts,--a process which many gentlemen besides Mr. Haley have found a specific for an uneasy conscience.
<p/>Haley gave an uneasy growl. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Haley walked reflectively to the other end of the boat. '' '' The boat swept proudly away from the shore, and all went on merrily, as before.
<p/>One day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lay to for a while at a small town in Kentucky, Haley went up into the place on a little matter of business.
<p/>Tom, whose fetters did not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) taking a moderate circuit, had drawn near the side of the boat, and stood listlessly gazing over the railing.
<p/>After a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw the trader returning, with an alert step, in company with a colored woman, bearing in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms a young child.
<p/>Men talked, and loafed, and read, and smoked. Women sewed, and children played, and the boat passed on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dressed quite respectably, and a colored man followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), bringing along a small trunk.
<p/>The woman came cheerfully onward, talking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came, with the man who bore her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) trunk, and so passed up the plank into the boat.
<p/>The woman walked forward among the boxes and bales of the lower deck, and, sitting down, busied herself with chirruping to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) baby.
<p/>Haley made a turn or two about the boat, and then, coming up, seated himself near her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and began saying something to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in an indifferent undertone.
<p/>The bell rung, the steamer whizzed, the engine groaned and coughed, and away swept the boat down the river. Tom soon noticed a heavy cloud passing over the woman's brow; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered rapidly, and with great vehemence.
<p/>'' I don't believe it,--I won't believe it! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say. '' You're jist a foolin' with me.'' ''
<p/>If you won't believe it, look here!'' said the man, drawing out a paper; <div class="bookquote">``this yer's the bill of sale, and there's your master's name to it; and I paid down good solid cash for it, too
<p/>, I can tell you,--so, now!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe Mas'r would cheat me so; it can't be true!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, with increasing agitation.
<p/>'' You can ask any of these men here, that can read writing. Here!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, to a man that was passing by, ``jist read this yer, won't you!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, it's a bill of sale, signed by John Fosdick,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, <div class="bookquote">``making over to you the girl Lucy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) child.
<p/>This yer gal won't believe me, when I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) what 't is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>It's all straight enough, for aught I see.
<p/>The woman's passionate exclamations collected a crowd around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the trader briefly explained to them the cause of the agitation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) told me that I was going down to Louisville, to hire out as cook to the same tavern where my husband works,--that's what Mas'r told me, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own self; and I can't believe he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'d lie to me,'' said the woman.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has sold you, my poor woman, there's no doubt about it,'' said a good-natured looking man, who had been examining the papers; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has done it, and no mistake.
<p/>Then it's no account talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said the woman, suddenly growing quite calm; and, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child tighter in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) box, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back round, and gazed listlessly into the river.
<p/>'' '' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Going to take it easy, after all!''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>said the trader. '' Gal's got grit, I see.
<p/>The woman looked calm, as the boat went on; and a beautiful soft summer breeze passed like a compassionate spirit over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head,--the gentle breeze, that never inquires whether the brow is dusky or fair that it fans.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw sunshine sparkling on the water, in golden ripples, and heard gay voices, full of ease and pleasure, talking around her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) everywhere; but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart lay as if a great stone had fallen on it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) baby raised himself up against her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks with his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little hands; and, springing up and down, crowing and chatting, seemed determined to arouse her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) strained him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) suddenly and tightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, and slowly one tear after another fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wondering, unconscious face; and gradually she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed, and little by little, to grow calmer, and busied herself with tending and nursing him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>The child, a boy of ten months, was uncommonly large and strong of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) age, and very vigorous in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) limbs.
<p/>'' Never, for a moment, still, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother constantly busy in holding him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and guarding his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) springing activity. ''
<p/>That's a fine chap!'' said a man, suddenly stopping opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets. '' How old is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
<p/>The man whistled to the boy, and offered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part of a stick of candy, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eagerly grabbed at, and very soon had it in a baby's general depository, to wit, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ten months and a half,''  (<font color='red'><b>the mother</b></font>)</div>said the mother. '' Rum fellow! '' said the man <div class="bookquote">``Knows what's what! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whistled, and walked on.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had got to the other side of the boat, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came across Haley, who was smoking on top of a pile of boxes.
<p/>The stranger produced a match, and lighted a cigar, saying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) did so, <div class="bookquote">``Decentish kind o' wench you've got round there, stranger.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, I reckon she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is tol`able fair,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, blowing the smoke out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) mouth. '' Taking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) down south?
<p/>'' said the man. Haley nodded, and smoked on. '' Plantation hand?'' said the man. '' Wal,'' said Haley, <div class="bookquote">``I'm fillin' out an order for a plantation, and I think I shall put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in.
<p/>They telled me she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a good cook; and they can use her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for that, or set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) at the cotton-picking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)'s got the right fingers for that; I looked at 'em. Sell well, either way;''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>and Haley resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) cigar. ''
<p/>They won't want the young `un on the plantation,'' said the man. '' I shall sell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), first chance I find,'' said Haley, lighting another cigar.
<p/>'' S'pose you'd be selling him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) tol`able cheap,'' said the stranger, mounting the pile of boxes, and sitting down comfortably. ''
<p/>Don't know `bout that,'' said Haley; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'s a pretty smart young `un, straight, fat, strong; flesh as hard as a brick!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley; ``they is raised as easy as any kind of critter there is going; they an't a bit more trouble than pups.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very true, but then there's the bother and expense of raisin'. ''  (<font color='red'><b>This chap</b></font>)</div>This yer chap will be running all around, in a month.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I've got a good place for raisin', and I thought of takin' in a little more stock,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.
<p/>'' One cook lost a young `un last week,--got drownded in a washtub, while she (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was a hangin' out the clothes,--and
<p/>I reckon it would be well enough to set her (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) to raisin' this yer. '' Haley and the stranger smoked a while in silence, neither seeming willing to broach the test question of the interview.
<p/>At last the man resumed: <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't think of wantin' more than ten dollars for that ar chap, seeing you must get him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) off yer hand, any how?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Haley shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) head, and spit impressively. '' That won't do, no ways,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) said, and began his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) smoking again.
<p/>Well, now,'' said Haley, <div class="bookquote">``I could raise that ar chap myself, or get him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) raised; he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'s oncommon likely and healthy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'d fetch a hundred dollars, six months hence; and, in a year or two, he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>)'d bring two hundred, if I had him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) in the right spot
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>Well, stranger, what will you take?'' '' ; I shan't take a cent less nor fifty for him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) now. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, stranger! that's rediculous, altogether,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. '' Fact! '' said Haley, with a decisive nod of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) head. ''
<p/>I'll give thirty for him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>),'' said the stranger, <div class="bookquote">``but not a cent more.''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger cent</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, I'll tell ye what I will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, spitting again, with renewed decision.
<p/>'' I'll split the difference, and say forty-five; and that's the most I will do. '' <div class="bookquote">``Well, agreed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, after an interval.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Done!''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley. '' Where do you land?'' <div class="bookquote">``At Louisville,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. '' Louisville,'' said Haley. '' Very fair, we get there about dusk.
<p/>Chap will be asleep,--all fair,--get him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) off quietly, and no screaming,--happens beautiful,--I like to do everything quietly,--I hates all kind of agitation and fluster.
<p/>And so, after a transfer of certain bills had passed from the man's pocket-book to the trader's, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cigar.
<p/>'' It was a bright, tranquil evening when the boat stopped at the wharf at Louisville. The woman had been sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) baby in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arms, now wrapped in a heavy sleep.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard the name of the place called out, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hastily laid the child down in a little cradle formed by the hollow among the boxes, first carefully spreading under it her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cloak; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sprung to the side of the boat, in hopes that, among the various hotel-waiters who thronged the wharf, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband.
<p/>In this hope, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pressed forward to the front rails, and, stretching far over them, strained her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes intently on the moving heads on the shore, and the crowd pressed in between her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and the child.
<p/>Don't wake him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) up, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to crying, now; it would make a devil of a fuss with the gal.
<p/>'' Now's your time,'' said Haley, taking the sleeping child up, and handing him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) to the stranger. '' '' The man took the bundle carefully, and was soon lost in the crowd that went up the wharf.
<p/>When the boat, creaking, and groaning, and puffing, had loosed from the wharf, and was beginning slowly to strain herself along, the woman returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) old seat.
<p/>The trader was sitting there,--the child was gone! '' Why, why,--where? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began, in bewildered surprise. '' Lucy,'' said the trader, <div class="bookquote">``your child's gone; you may as well know it first as last.
<p/>You see, I know'd you couldn't take him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) down south; and I got a chance to sell him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) to a first-rate family
<p/>The trader had arrived at that stage of Christian and political perfection which has been recommended by some preachers and politicians of the north, lately, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had completely overcome every humane weakness and prejudice.
<p/>, that'll raise him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) better than you can. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) heart was exactly where yours, sir, and mine could be brought, with proper effort and cultivation.
<p/>The wild look of anguish and utter despair that the woman cast on him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) might have disturbed one less practised; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was used to it.
<p/>You can get used to such things, too, my friend; and it is the great object of recent efforts to make our whole northern community used to them, for the glory of the Union.
<p/>So the trader only regarded the mortal anguish which he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) saw working in those dark features, those clenched hands, and suffocating breathings, as necessary incidents of the trade, and merely calculated whether she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going to scream, and get up a commotion on the boat; for, like other supporters of our peculiar institution, he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) decidedly disliked agitation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) had seen that same look hundreds of times. But the woman did not scream. The shot had passed too straight and direct through the heart, for cry or tear.
<p/>Dizzily she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) slack hands fell lifeless by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes looked straight forward, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw nothing.
<p/>All the noise and hum of the boat, the groaning of the machinery, mingled dreamily to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bewildered ear; and the poor, dumb-stricken heart had neither cry not tear to show for its utter misery.
<p/>The trader, who, considering his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) advantages, was almost as humane as some of our politicians, seemed to feel called on to administer such consolation as the case admitted of.
<p/>I know this yer comes kinder hard, at first, Lucy,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but such a smart, sensible gal as you are, won't give way to it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was quite calm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You see it's necessary , and can't be helped!'' <div class="bookquote">``O! don't, Mas`r, don't! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, with a voice like one that is smothering.
<p/>You're a smart wench, Lucy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) persisted; <div class="bookquote">``I mean to do well by ye, and get ye a nice place down river; and you'll soon get another husband,--such a likely gal as you--
<p/>Mas`r, if you only won't talk to me now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the woman, in a voice of such quick and living anguish that the trader felt that there was something at present in the case beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) style of operation.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``O! He (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) got up, and the woman turned away, and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cloak. The trader walked up and down for a time, and occasionally stopped and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Takes it hard, rather,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) soliloquized, <div class="bookquote">``but quiet, tho';--let her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sweat a while ; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll come right, by and by!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom had watched the whole transaction from first to last, and had a perfect understanding of its results. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), it looked like something unutterably horrible and cruel, because, poor, ignorant black soul!
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had only been instructed by certain ministers of Christianity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might have thought better of it, and seen in it an every-day incident of a lawful trade; a trade which is the vital support of an institution which an American divine* tells us has <div class="bookquote">``no evils but such as are inseparable from any other relations in social and domestic life .
<p/>But Tom, as we see, being a poor, ignorant fellow, whose reading had been confined entirely to the New Testament, could not comfort and solace himself with views like these.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) very soul bled within him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) for what seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) the wrongs of the poor suffering thing that lay like a crushed reed on the boxes; the feeling, living, bleeding, yet immortal thing , which American state law coolly classes with the bundles, and bales, and boxes, among which she (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is lying.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had not learned to generalize, and to take enlarged views. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>* Dr. Joel Parker of Philadelphia. -LSB-Mrs. Stowe's note.-RSB-
<p/>Presbyterian clergyman -LRB-1799-1873-RRB-, a friend of the Beecher family. Mrs. Stowe attempted unsuccessfully to have this identifying note removed from the stereotype-plate of the first edition.
<p/>Honestly, and with tears running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Beecher</b></font>) own cheeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Beecher</b></font>) spoke of a heart of love in the skies, of a pitying Jesus, and an eternal home; but the ear was deaf with anguish, and the palsied heart could not feel.
<p/>Tom drew near, and tried to say something; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Stowe</b></font>) only groaned. Night came on,--night calm, unmoved, and glorious, shining down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Stowe</b></font>) innumerable and solemn angel eyes, twinkling, beautiful, but silent.
<p/>One after another, the voices of business or pleasure died away; all on the boat were sleeping, and the ripples at the prow were plainly heard.
<p/>Tom stretched himself out on a box, and there, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard, ever and anon, a smothered sob or cry from the prostrate creature,--<div class="bookquote">``O!
<p/>There was no speech nor language, no pitying voice or helping hand, from that distant sky. what shall I do? O Lord!
<p/>O good Lord, do help me! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>and so, ever and anon, until the murmur died away in silence. At midnight, Tom waked, with a sudden start.
<p/>Something black passed quickly by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the side of the boat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard a splash in the water. No one else saw or heard anything.
<p/>The poor bleeding heart was still, at last, and the river rippled and dimpled just as brightly as if it had not closed above it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head,--the woman's place was vacant! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got up, and sought about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in vain. Patience! patience! ye whose hearts swell indignant at wrongs like these.
<p/>Not one throb of anguish, not one tear of the oppressed, is forgotten by the Man of Sorrows, the Lord of Glory.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) patient, generous bosom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) bears the anguish of a world. ''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>The trader waked up bright and early, and came out to see to his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) live stock.
<p/>It was now his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) turn to look about in perplexity. '' Where alive is that gal? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) said to Tom.
<p/>Tom, who had learned the wisdom of keeping counsel, did not feel called upon to state his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) observations and suspicions, but said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not know.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) surely couldn't have got off in the night at any of the landings, for I was awake, and on the lookout, whenever the boat stopped.
<p/>'' I never trust these yer things to other folks. '' This speech was addressed to Tom quite confidentially, as if it was something that would be specially interesting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>The trader searched the boat from stem to stern, among boxes, bales and barrels, around the machinery, by the chimneys, in vain.
<p/>Now, I say, Tom, be fair about this yer,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, when, after a fruitless search, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came where Tom was standing.
<p/>I saw the gal stretched out here about ten o'clock, and ag`in at twelve, and ag`in between one and two; and then at four she (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) was gone, and you was a sleeping right there all the time.
<p/>Tom made no answer. '' '' You know something about it, now. Don't tell me,--I know you do. Now, you know something,--you

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) had seen Death many times,--met him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) in the way of trade, and got acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>),--and he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) only thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) as a hard customer, that embarrassed his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) property operations very unfairly; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) only swore that the gal was a baggage, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) was devilish unlucky, and that, if things went on in this way, he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) should not make a cent on the trip.
<p/>In short, he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) seemed to consider himself an ill-used man, decidedly; but there was no help for it, as the woman had escaped into a state which never will give up a fugitive,--not even at the demand of the whole glorious Union.
<p/>The trader, therefore, sat discontentedly down, with his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) little account-book, and put down the missing body and soul under the head of losses!
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>)'s a shocking creature, isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>),--this trader? so unfeeling! It's dreadful, really!'' <div class="bookquote">``O, but nobody thinks anything of these traders!
<p/>They are universally despised,--never received into any decent society. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>But who, sir, makes the trader? Who is most to blame?
<p/>The enlightened, cultivated, intelligent man, who supports the system of which the trader is the inevitable result, or the poor trader himself?
<p/>You make the public statement that calls for his (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) trade, that debauches and depraves him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>), till he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) feels no shame in it; and in what are you better than he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>)?
<p/>Are you educated and he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) ignorant, you high and he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) low , you refined and he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) coarse, you talented and he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) simple?
<p/>In concluding these little incidents of lawful trade, we must beg the world not to think that American legislators are entirely destitute of humanity, as might, perhaps, be unfairly inferred from the great efforts made in our national body to protect and perpetuate this species of traffic.
<p/>In the day of a future judgment, these very considerations may make it more tolerable for him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) than for you. Who does not know how our great men are outdoing themselves, in declaiming against the foreign slave-trade.
<p/>There are a perfect host of Clarksons and Wilberforces * risen up among us on that subject, most edifying to hear and behold.
<p/>Trading negroes from Africa, dear reader, is so horrid! It is not to be thought of! But trading them from Kentucky,--that's quite another thing!
<p/>Thomas Clarkson -LRB-1760-1846-RRB- and William Wilberforce -LRB-1759- 1833-RRB-, English philanthropists and anti-slavery agitators who helped to secure passage of the Emancipation Bill by Parliament in 1833.
<p/>A large, roomy, neatly-painted kitchen, its yellow floor glossy and smooth, and without a particle of dust; a neat, well-blacked cooking-stove; rows of shining tin, suggestive of unmentionable good things to the appetite; glossy green wood chairs, old and firm; a small flag-bottomed rocking-chair, with a patch-work cushion in it, neatly contrived out of small pieces of different colored woollen goods, and a larger sized one, motherly and old, whose wide arms breathed hospitable invitation, seconded by the solicitation of its feather cushions,--a real comfortable, persuasive old chair, and worth, in the way of honest, homely enjoyment, a dozen of your plush or brochetelle drawing-room gentry; and in the chair, gently swaying back and forward, her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) eyes bent on some fine sewing, sat our fine old friend Eliza.
<p/>Yes, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) is, paler and thinner than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) Kentucky home, with a world of quiet sorrow lying under the shadow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) long eyelashes, and marking the outline of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) gentle mouth!
<p/>It was plain to see how old and firm the girlish heart was grown under the discipline of heavy sorrow; and when, anon, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) large dark eye was raised to follow the gambols of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) little Harry, who was sporting, like some tropical butterfly, hither and thither over the floor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) showed a depth of firmness and steady resolve that was never there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) earlier and happier days.
<p/>By her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) side sat a woman with a bright tin pan in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) lap, into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was carefully sorting some dried peaches.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) might be fifty-five or sixty; but hers was one of those faces that time seems to touch only to brighten and adorn.
<p/>* CHAPTER XIII The Quaker Settlement A quiet scene now rises before us. The snowy lisse crape cap, made after the strait Quaker pattern,--the
<p/>plain white muslin handkerchief, lying in placid folds across her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) bosom,--the drab shawl and dress,--showed at once the community to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) belonged.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) hair, partially silvered by age, was parted smoothly back from a high placid forehead, on which time had written no inscription, except peace on earth, good will to men, and beneath shone a large pair of clear, honest, loving brown eyes; you only needed to look straight into them, to feel that you saw to the bottom of a heart as good and true as ever throbbed in woman's bosom.
<p/>So much has been said and sung of beautiful young girls, why don't somebody wake up to the beauty of old women?
<p/>If any want to get up an inspiration under this head, we refer them to our good friend Rachel Halliday, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) sits there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) little rocking-chair.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) face was round and rosy, with a healthful downy softness, suggestive of a ripe peach. It had a turn for quacking and squeaking,--that chair
<p/>had,--either from having taken cold in early life, or from some asthmatic affection, or perhaps from nervous derangement; but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) gently swung backward and forward, the chair kept up a kind of subdued <div class="bookquote">``creechy crawchy,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that would have been intolerable in any other chair.
<p/>But old Simeon Halliday often declared it was as good as any music to him (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>), and the children all avowed that they wouldn't miss of hearing mother's chair for anything in the world.
<p/>For why? for twenty years or more, nothing but loving words, and gentle moralities, and motherly loving kindness, had come from that chair;--head-aches and heart-aches innumerable had been cured there,--difficulties spiritual and temporal solved there,--all by one good, loving woman, God bless her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!
<p/>'' And so thee still thinks of going to Canada, Eliza? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was quietly looking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) peaches.
<p/>'' Yes, ma'am,'' said Eliza, firmly. '' I must go onward. I dare not stop. '' '' And what'll thee do, when thee gets there?
<p/>My daughter'' came naturally from the lips of Rachel Halliday; for hers was just the face and form that made <div class="bookquote">``mother''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel/Rachel Halliday</b></font>)</div>seem the most natural word in the world.
<p/>Eliza's hands trembled, and some tears fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) fine work; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) answered, firmly, <div class="bookquote">``I shall do--anything I can find.
<p/>Thee must think about that, my daughter.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' I hope I can find something.'' '' Thee knows thee can stay here, as long as thee pleases,'' said Rachel.
<p/>'' O, thank you,'' said Eliza, <div class="bookquote">``but'' (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) pointed to Harry--<div class="bookquote">``I can't sleep nights; I can't rest. Last night I dreamed I saw that man coming into the yard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, shuddering.
<p/>'' Poor child!'' said Rachel, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) eyes; <div class="bookquote">``but thee mustn't feel so. The Lord hath ordered it so that never hath a fugitive been stolen from our village.
<p/>The door here opened, and a little short, round, pin-cushiony woman stood at the door, with a cheery, blooming face, like a ripe apple.
<p/>I trust thine will not be the first. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel/Rachel Halliday</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dressed, like Rachel, in sober gray, with the muslin folded neatly across her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) round, plump little chest.
<p/>Nicely,'' said Ruth, taking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) little drab bonnet, and dusting it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) handkerchief, displaying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) did so, a round little head, on which the Quaker cap sat with a sort of jaunty air, despite all the stroking and patting of the small fat hands, which were busily applied to arranging it.
<p/>Certain stray locks of decidedly curly hair, too, had escaped here and there, and had to be coaxed and cajoled into their place again; and then the new comer, who might have been five-and-twenty, turned from the small looking-glass, before which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) had been making these arrangements, and looked well pleased,--as most people who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) might have been,--for
<p/>'' Ruth Stedman,'' said Rachel, coming joyfully forward; <div class="bookquote">``how is thee, Ruth? she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) said, heartily taking both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) hands. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel/Rachel Halliday</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) was decidedly a wholesome, whole-hearted, chirruping little woman, as ever gladdened man's heart withal.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad to see thee, Eliza,--very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruth</b></font>)</div>said Ruth, shaking hands, as if Eliza were an old friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had long been expecting; <div class="bookquote">``and this is thy dear
<p/>boy,--I brought a cake for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, holding out a little heart to the boy, who came up, gazing through his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) curls, and accepted it shyly.
<p/>'' Ruth, this friend is Eliza Harris; and this is the little boy I told thee of.'' '' Where's thy baby, Ruth?'' said Rachel.
<p/>O, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'s coming; but thy Mary caught him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as I came in, and ran off with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to the barn, to show him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to the children.
<p/>At this moment, the door opened, and Mary, an honest, rosy-looking girl, with large brown eyes, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother's, came in with the baby.
<p/>Ah! ha!'' said Rachel, coming up, and taking the great, white, fat fellow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) arms, <div class="bookquote">``how good he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) looks, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) does grow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div><p/>To be sure, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) does,'' said little bustling Ruth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) took the child, and began taking off a little blue silk hood, and various layers and wrappers of outer garments; and having given a twitch here, and a pull there, and variously adjusted and arranged him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) heartily, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) set him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) on the floor to collect his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>Baby seemed quite used to this mode of proceeding, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) thumb in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mouth -LRB-as if it were quite a thing of course-RRB-, and seemed soon absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own reflections, while the mother seated herself, and taking out a long stocking of mixed blue and white yarn, began to knit with briskness.
<p/>Mary took the kettle to the well, and soon reappearing, placed it over the stove, where it was soon purring and steaming, a sort of censer of hospitality and good cheer.
<p/>The peaches, moreover, in obedience to a few gentle whispers from Rachel, were soon deposited, by the same hand, in a stew-pan over the fire.
<p/>Rachel now took down a snowy moulding-board, and, tying on an apron, proceeded quietly to making up some biscuits, first saying to Mary,--<div class="bookquote">``Mary, hadn't thee better tell John to get a chicken ready?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>and Mary disappeared accordingly.
<p/>'' '' '' '' '' Mary, thee'd better fill the kettle, hadn't thee?'' gently suggested the mother. '' And how is Abigail Peters?'' said Rachel, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) biscuits.
<p/>Leah Hills went in, this afternoon, and baked bread and pies enough to last some days; and I engaged to go back to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) up, this evening.''
<p/>'' O, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>)'s better,'' said Ruth; ``I was in, this morning; made the bed, tidied up the house. <div class="bookquote">``I will go in tomorrow, and do any cleaning there may be, and look over the mending,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel/Rachel Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Rachel.
<p/>'' Ah! that is well,'' said Ruth. '' I've heard,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that Hannah Stanwood is sick. John was up there, last night,--I must go there tomorrow.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``John can come in here to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) meals, if thee needs to stay all day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel/Rachel Halliday</b></font>)</div>suggested Rachel. '' Thank thee, Rachel; will see, tomorrow; but, here comes Simeon.
<p/>'' Simeon Halliday, a tall, straight, muscular man, in drab coat and pantaloons, and broad-brimmed hat, now entered. '' How is thee, Ruth?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) said, warmly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) spread his (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) broad open hand for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) little fat palm; <div class="bookquote">``and how is John?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O!
<p/>John is well, and all the rest of our folks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ruth</b></font>)</div>said Ruth, cheerily. '' Any news, father?'' said Rachel, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) was putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) biscuits into the oven.
<p/>Peter Stebbins told me that they should be along tonight, with friends ,'' said Simeon, significantly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) was washing his (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) hands at a neat sink, in a little back porch.
<p/>'' '' Indeed!'' said Rachel, looking thoughtfully, and glancing at Eliza. '' Did thee say thy name was Harris?'' said Simeon to Eliza, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) reentered.
<p/>Rachel glanced quickly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) husband, as Eliza tremulously answered <div class="bookquote">``yes;''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) fears, ever uppermost, suggesting that possibly there might be advertisements out for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mother!''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon, standing in the porch, and calling Rachel out. '' What does thee want, father?'' said Rachel, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) floury hands, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) went into the porch.
<p/>'' This child's husband is in the settlement, and will be here tonight,'' said Simeon. '' Now, thee doesn't say that, father?'' said Rachel, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) face radiant with joy.
<p/>Peter was down yesterday, with the wagon, to the other stand, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) found an old woman and two men; and one said his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) name was George Harris; and from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) told of his (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) history, I am certain who he (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is.
<p/>'' It's really true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Peter</b></font>) is a bright, likely fellow, too.'' '' Shall we tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now?'' said Simeon. '' Let's tell Ruth,'' said Rachel.
<p/>'' Here, Ruth,--come here. '' Ruth laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) knitting-work, and was in the back porch in a moment. '' Ruth, what does thee think?'' said Rachel.
<p/>'' Father says Eliza's husband is in the last company, and will be here tonight. '' A burst of joy from the little Quakeress interrupted the speech.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) gave such a bound from the floor, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) little hands, that two stray curls fell from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) Quaker cap, and lay brightly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) white neckerchief.
<p/>'' Hush thee, dear!'' said Rachel, gently; <div class="bookquote">``hush, Ruth! Tell us, shall we tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel/Rachel Halliday</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now! to be sure,--this very minute.
<p/>Thee uses thyself only to learn how to love thy neighbor, Ruth,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon, looking, with a beaming face, on Ruth.
<p/>Why, now, suppose 't was my John, how should I feel? Do tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>), right off.'' '' '' To be sure.
<p/>Isn't it what we are made for? If I didn't love John and the baby, I should not know how to feel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>).
<p/>Come, now do tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>),--do! '' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) hands persuasively on Rachel's arm. ``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) into thy bed-room, there, and let me fry the chicken while thee does it.
<p/>Rachel came out into the kitchen, where Eliza was sewing, and opening the door of a small bed-room, said, gently, <div class="bookquote">``Come in here with me, my daughter; I have news to tell thee.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>'' The blood flushed in Eliza's pale face; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) rose, trembling with nervous anxiety, and looked towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) boy. ''
<p/>No, no,'' said little Ruth, darting up, and seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) hands. '' Never thee fear; it's good news, Eliza,--go in, go in!
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) gently pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to the door which closed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>); and then, turning round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) caught little Harry in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) arms, and began kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' Thee'll see thy father, little one. Does thee know it? Thy father is coming,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, over and over again, as the boy looked wonderingly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
<p/>Rachel Halliday drew Eliza toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``The Lord hath had mercy on thee, daughter; thy husband hath escaped from the house of bondage.
<p/>The blood flushed to Eliza's cheek in a sudden glow, and went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) heart with as sudden a rush.
<p/>Meanwhile, within the door, another scene was going on. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) sat down, pale and faint. '' Have courage, child,'' said Rachel, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is among friends, who will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) here tonight.'' <div class="bookquote">``Tonight!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>Eliza repeated, <div class="bookquote">``tonight!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>The words lost all meaning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) head was dreamy and confused; all was mist for a moment.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) awoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) found herself snugly tucked up on the bed, with a blanket over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), and little Ruth rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) hands with camphor.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) eyes in a state of dreamy, delicious languor, such as one who has long been bearing a heavy load, and now feels it gone, and would rest.
<p/>The tension of the nerves, which had never ceased a moment since the first hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) flight, had given way, and a strange feeling of security and rest came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>); and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) lay, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) large, dark eyes open, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) followed, as in a quiet dream, the motions of those about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) saw the door open into the other room; saw the supper-table, with its snowy cloth; heard the dreamy murmur of the singing tea-kettle; saw Ruth tripping backward and forward, with plates of cake and saucers of preserves, and ever and anon stopping to put a cake into Harry's hand, or pat his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) head, or twine his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) long curls round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) snowy fingers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) saw the ample, motherly form of Rachel, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) ever and anon came to the bedside, and smoothed and arranged something about the bedclothes, and gave a tuck here and there, by way of expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) good-will; and was conscious of a kind of sunshine beaming down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) large, clear, brown eyes.
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) fly up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and commence whispering very earnestly, ever and anon, with impressive gesture, pointing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) little finger toward the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>), with the baby in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) arms, sitting down to tea; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) saw them all at table, and little Harry in a high chair, under the shadow of Rachel's ample wing; there were low murmurs of talk, gentle tinkling of tea-spoons, and musical clatter of cups and saucers, and all mingled in a delightful dream of rest; and Eliza slept, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had not slept before, since the fearful midnight hour when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child and fled through the frosty starlight.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) dreamed of a beautiful country,--a land, it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), of rest,--green shores, pleasant islands, and beautifully glittering water; and there, in a house which kind voices told her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was a home
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband's footsteps; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) felt him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) coming nearer; his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arms were around her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) tears falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) awoke!
<p/>The daylight had long faded; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child lay calmly sleeping by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) side; a candle was burning dimly on the stand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband was sobbing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) pillow.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) saw Ruth's husband come in,--saw , she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) boy playing, free and happy child. It was no dream. The next morning was a cheerful one at the Quaker house.
<p/>Mother'' was up betimes, and surrounded by busy girls and boys, whom we had scarce time to introduce to our readers yesterday, and who all moved obediently to Rachel's gentle
<p/>'' in the work of getting breakfast; for a breakfast in the luxurious valleys of Indiana is a thing complicated and multiform, and, like picking up the rose-leaves and trimming the bushes in Paradise, asking other hands than those of the original mother.
<p/>While, therefore, John ran to the spring for fresh water, and Simeon the second sifted meal for corn-cakes, and Mary ground coffee,
<p/>Rachel moved gently, and quietly about, making biscuits, cutting up chicken, and diffusing a sort of sunny radiance over the whole proceeding generally.
<p/>If there was any danger of friction or collision from the ill-regulated zeal of so many young operators, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) gentle <div class="bookquote">``Come!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>operators</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thee had better,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or more gentle <div class="bookquote">``Hadn't thee better? come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was quite sufficient to allay the difficulty.
<p/>We had rather, for our part, have the cestus of Rachel Halliday, that kept heads from being turned, and made everything go on harmoniously.
<p/>Bards have written of the cestus of Venus, that turned the heads of all the world in successive generations. We think it is more suited to our modern days, decidedly.
<p/>While all other preparations were going on, Simeon the elder stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) shirt-sleeves before a little looking-glass in the corner, engaged in the anti-patriarchal operation of shaving.
<p/>Everything went on so sociably, so quietly, so harmoniously, in the great kitchen,--it seemed so pleasant to every one to do just what they were doing, there was such an atmosphere of mutual confidence and good fellowship everywhere,--even
<p/>the knives and forks had a social clatter as they went on to the table; and the chicken and ham had a cheerful and joyous fizzle in the pan, as if they rather enjoyed being cooked than otherwise;--and when George and Eliza and little Harry came out, they met such a hearty, rejoicing welcome, no wonder it seemed to them like a dream.
<p/>At last, they were all seated at breakfast, while Mary stood at the stove, baking griddle-cakes, which, as they gained the true exact golden-brown tint of perfection, were transferred quite handily to the table.
<p/>There was so much motherliness and full-heartedness even in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) passed a plate of cakes or poured a cup of coffee, that it seemed to put a spirit into the food and drink she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) offered.
<p/>It was the first time that ever George had sat down on equal terms at any white man's table; and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat down, at first, with some constraint and awkwardness; but they all exhaled and went off like fog, in the genial morning rays of this simple, overflowing kindness.
<p/>This, indeed, was a home,-- home ,--a word that George had never yet known a meaning for; and a belief in God, and trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) providence, began to encircle his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart, as, with a golden cloud of protection and confidence, dark, misanthropic, pining atheistic doubts, and fierce despair, melted away before the light of a living Gospel, breathed in living faces, preached by a thousand unconscious acts of love and good will, which, like the cup of cold water given in the name of a disciple, shall never lose their reward.
<p/>Rachel never looked so truly and benignly happy as at the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) table. '' Father, what if thee should get found out again?'' said Simeon second, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) buttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) cake.
<p/>'' I should pay my fine,'' said Simeon, quietly. '' But what if they put thee in prison? '' <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't thee and mother manage the farm?''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon, smiling.
<p/>'' Mother can do almost everything,'' said the boy. '' But isn't it a shame to make such laws?'' '' Thee mustn't speak evil of thy rulers, Simeon,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) father, gravely.
<p/>The Lord only gives us our worldly goods that we may do justice and mercy; if our rulers require a price of us for it, we must deliver it up.
<p/>'' '' Well, I hate those old slaveholders!'' said the boy, who felt as unchristian as became any modern reformer. ''
<p/>I would do even the same for the slaveholder as for the slave, if the Lord brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to my door in affliction.
<p/>Simeon second blushed scarlet; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) mother only smiled, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Simeon is my good boy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) will grow older, by and by, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) will be like his (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) father.
<p/>I am surprised at thee, son,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said Simeon; <div class="bookquote">``thy mother never taught thee so. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I hope, my good sir, that you are not exposed to any difficulty on our account,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, anxiously.
<p/>'' Fear nothing, George, for therefore are we sent into the world. If we would not meet trouble for a good cause, we were not worthy of our name.''
<p/>'' But, for me ,'' said George, <div class="bookquote">``I could not bear it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Fear not, then, friend George; it is not for thee, but for God and man, we do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon.
<p/>'' And now thou must lie by quietly this day, and tonight, at ten o'clock, Phineas Fletcher will carry thee onward to the next stand,--thee and the rest of thy company.
<p/>The pursuers are hard after thee; we must not delay.'' '' If that is the case, why wait till evening?'' said George.
<p/>'' Thou art safe here by daylight, for every one in the settlement is a Friend, and all are watching. It has been found safer to travel by night.
<p/>'' CHAPTER XIV Evangeline ``A young star! which shone O'er life--too sweet an image, for such glass! A lovely being, scarcely formed or moulded; A rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded.
<p/>How, as by an enchanted wand, have its scenes been changed, since Chateaubriand wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Friend</b></font>) prose-poetic description of it,* as a river of mighty, unbroken solitudes, rolling amid undreamed wonders of vegetable and animal existence.
<p/>In Atala; or the Love and Constantcy of Two Savages in the Desert -LRB-1801-RRB- by Francois Auguste Rene, Vicomte de Chateaubriand -LRB-1768-1848-RRB-.
<p/>But as in an hour, this river of dreams and wild romance has emerged to a reality scarcely less visionary and splendid.
<p/>What other river of the world bears on its bosom to the ocean the wealth and enterprise of such another country?--a country whose products embrace all between the tropics and the poles!
<p/>Those turbid waters, hurrying, foaming, tearing along, an apt resemblance of that headlong tide of business which is poured along its wave by a race more vehement and energetic than any the old world ever saw.
<p/>would that they did not also bear along a more fearful freight,--the tears of the oppressed, the sighs of the helpless, the bitter prayers of poor, ignorant hearts to an unknown God--unknown, unseen and silent, but who will yet <div class="bookquote">``come out of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) place to save all the poor of the earth!''
 (<font color='red'><b>an God</b></font>)</div><p/>The slanting light of the setting sun quivers on the sea-like expanse of the river; the shivery canes, and the tall, dark cypress, hung with wreaths of dark, funereal moss, glow in the golden ray, as the heavily-laden steamboat marches onward.
<p/>Piled with cotton-bales, from many a plantation, up over deck and sides, till she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seems in the distance a square, massive block of gray, she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) moves heavily onward to the nearing mart.
<p/>'' The Mississippi! * Ah! We must look some time among its crowded decks before we shall find again our humble friend Tom.
<p/>Partly from confidence inspired by Mr. Shelby's representations, and partly from the remarkably inoffensive and quiet character of the man, Tom had insensibly won his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) way far into the confidence even of such a man as Haley.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) had watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) narrowly through the day, and never allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) to sleep at night unfettered; but the uncomplaining patience and apparent contentment of Tom's manner led him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gradually to discontinue these restraints, and for some time Tom had enjoyed a sort of parole of honor, being permitted to come and go freely where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pleased on the boat.
<p/>Ever quiet and obliging, and more than ready to lend a hand in every emergency which occurred among the workmen below, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had won the good opinion of all the hands, and spent many hours in helping them with as hearty a good will as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) worked on a Kentucky farm.
<p/>When there seemed to be nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would climb to a nook among the cotton-bales of the upper deck, and busy himself in studying over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Bible,--and
<p/>High on the upper deck, in a little nook among the everywhere predominant cotton-bales, at last we may find him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). it is there
<p/>For a hundred or more miles above New Orleans, the river is higher than the surrounding country, and rolls its tremendous volume between massive levees twenty feet in height.
<p/>The traveller from the deck of the steamer, as from some floating castle top, overlooks the whole country for miles and miles around.
<p/>Tom, therefore, had spread out full before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), in plantation after plantation, a map of the life to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was approaching.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw the distant slaves at their toil; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw afar their villages of huts gleaming out in long rows on many a plantation, distant from the stately mansions and pleasure-grounds of the master;--and as the moving picture passed on, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) poor, foolish heart would be turning backward to the Kentucky farm, with its old shadowy beeches,--to the master's house, with its wide, cool halls, and, near by, the little cabin overgrown with the multiflora and bignonia.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) seemed to see familiar faces of comrades who had grown up with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) from infancy; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) busy wife, bustling in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) preparations for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) evening meals; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) heard the merry laugh of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) boys at their play, and the chirrup of the baby at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) knee; and then, with a start, all faded, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) saw again the canebrakes and cypresses and gliding plantations, and heard again the creaking and groaning of the machinery, all telling him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) too plainly that all that phase of life had gone by forever.
<p/>In such a case, you write to your wife, and send messages to your children; but Tom could not write,--the mail for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had no existence, and the gulf of separation was unbridged by even a friendly word or signal.
<p/>Is it strange, then, that some tears fall on the pages of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Bible, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lays it on the cotton-bale, and, with patient finger, threading his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) slow way from word to word, traces out its promises?
<p/>we see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) now. Having learned late in life, Tom was but a slow reader, and passed on laboriously from verse to verse.
<p/>one whose words, like ingots of gold, seem often to need to be weighed separately, that the mind may take in their priceless value.
<p/>Fortunate for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was it that the book he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was intent on was one which slow reading cannot injure,--nay, Let us follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a moment, as, pointing to each word, and pronouncing each half aloud, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reads, <div class="bookquote">``Let--not--your--heart--be--troubled.
<p/>In--my --Father's--house--are--many--mansions. I--go--to--prepare--a--place--for--you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Cicero, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) darling and only daughter, had a heart as full of honest grief as poor
<p/>only men;--but Cicero could pause over no such sublime words of hope, and look to no such future reunion; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) had seen them, ten to one he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would not have believed,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) must fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) head first with a thousand questions of authenticity of manuscript, and correctness of translation.
<p/>But, to poor Tom, there it lay, just what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) needed, so evidently true and divine that the possibility of a question never entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) simple head.
<p/>As for Tom's Bible, though it had no annotations and helps in margin from learned commentators, still it had been embellished with certain way-marks and guide-boards of Tom's own invention, and which helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) more than the most learned expositions could have done.
<p/>It had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) custom to get the Bible read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master's children, in particular by young Master George; and, as they read, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would designate, by bold, strong marks and dashes, with pen and ink, the passages which more particularly gratified his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ear or affected his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heart.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Bible was thus marked through, from one end to the other, with a variety of styles and designations; so he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could in a moment seize upon his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) favorite passages, without the labor of spelling out what lay between them;--and while it lay there before him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), every passage breathing of some old home scene, and recalling some past enjoyment, his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) Bible seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) all of this life that remained, as well as the promise of a future one.
<p/>Among the passengers on the boat was a young gentleman of fortune and family, resident in New Orleans, who bore the name of St. Clare.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a daughter between five and six years of age, together with a lady who seemed to claim relationship to both, and to have the little one especially under her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) charge.
<p/>Tom's,--perhaps no fuller, for both were It must be true; for, if not true, how could he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) live? Tom had often caught glimpses of this little girl,--for
<p/>, that can be no more contained in one place than a sunbeam or a summer breeze,--nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) one that, once seen, could be easily forgotten.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was one of those busy, tripping creatures Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) form was the perfection of childish beauty, without its usual chubbiness and squareness of outline.
<p/>There was about it an undulating and aerial grace, such as one might dream of for some mythic and allegorical being.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty of feature than for a singular and dreamy earnestness of expression, which made the ideal start when they looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and by which the dullest and most literal were impressed, without exactly knowing why.
<p/>The shape of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and the turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neck and bust was peculiarly noble, and the long golden-brown hair that floated like a cloud around it, the deep spiritual gravity of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) violet blue eyes, shaded by heavy fringes of golden brown,--all marked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out from other children, and made every one turn and look after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) glided hither and thither on the boat.
<p/>On the contrary, an airy and innocent playfulness seemed to flicker like the shadow of summer leaves over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) childish face, and around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) buoyant figure.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was always in motion, always with a half smile on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rosy mouth, flying hither and thither, with an undulating and cloud-like tread, singing to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) moved as in a happy dream.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father and female guardian were incessantly busy in pursuit of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),--but, when caught, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) melted from them again like a summer cloud; and as no word of chiding or reproof ever fell on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ear for whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chose to do, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own way all over the boat.
<p/>Always dressed in white, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to move like a shadow through all sorts of places, without contracting spot or stain; and there was not a corner or nook, above or below, where those fairy footsteps had not glided, and that visionary golden head, with its deep blue eyes, fleeted along.
<p/>The fireman, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fireman</b></font>) looked up from his (<font color='blue'><b>fireman</b></font>) sweaty toil, sometimes found those eyes looking wonderingly into the raging depths of the furnace, and fearfully and pityingly at him (<font color='blue'><b>fireman</b></font>), as if she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>fireman</b></font>) in some dreadful danger.
<p/>Anon the steersman at the wheel paused and smiled, as the picture-like head gleamed through the window of the round house, and in a moment was gone again.
<p/>A thousand times a day rough voices blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>), and smiles of unwonted softness stole over hard faces, as she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) passed; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) tripped fearlessly over dangerous places, rough, sooty hands were stretched involuntarily out to save her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>), and smooth her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) path.
<p/>Tom, who had the soft, impressible nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) kindly race, ever yearning toward the simple and childlike, watched the little creature with daily increasing interest.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) seemed something almost divine; and whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) golden head and deep blue eyes peered out upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from behind some dusky cotton-bale, or looked down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) over some ridge of packages, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) half believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw one of the angels stepped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) New Testament.
<p/>Nevertheless, the little one was not what you would have called either a grave child or a sad one. Often and often she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) walked mournfully round the place where Haley's gang of men and women sat in their chains.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) would glide in among them, and look at them with an air of perplexed and sorrowful earnestness; and sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) would lift their chains with her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) slender hands, and then sigh wofully, as she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) glided away.
<p/>Several times she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) appeared suddenly among them, with her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) hands full of candy, nuts, and oranges, which she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) would distribute joyfully to them, and then be gone again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) knew an abundance of simple acts to propitiate and invite the approaches of the little people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) resolved to play his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) part right skilfully.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) could cut cunning little baskets out of cherry-stones, could make grotesque faces on hickory-nuts, or odd-jumping figures out of elder-pith, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) was a very Pan in the manufacture of whistles of all sizes and sorts.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) pockets were full of miscellaneous articles of attraction, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) had hoarded in days of old for his (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) master's children, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) now produced, with commendable prudence and economy, one by one, as overtures for acquaintance and friendship.
<p/>The little one was shy, for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) busy interest in everything going on, and it was not easy to tame her (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>).
<p/>For a while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Haley</b></font>) would perch like a canary-bird on some box or package near Tom, while busy in the little arts afore-named, and take from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), with a kind of grave bashfulness, the little articles he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) offered.
<p/>Tom watched the little lady a great deal, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ventured on any overtures towards acquaintanceship. But at last they got on quite confidential terms.
<p/>'' What's little missy's name?'' said Tom, at last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought matters were ripe to push such an inquiry. ''
<p/>Evangeline St. Clare,'' said the little one, <div class="bookquote">``though papa and everybody else call me Eva. Now, what's your name?''  (<font color='red'><b>Evangeline St. Clare</b></font>)</div>'' My name's Tom
<p/>; the little chil`en used to call me Uncle Tom, way back thar in Kentuck.'' '' Then I mean to call you Uncle Tom, because, you see, I like you,'' said Eva.
<p/>'' So, Uncle Tom, where are you going?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know, Miss Eva.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't know?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva. '' No, I am going to be sold to somebody.
<p/>I don't know who.'' '' My papa can buy you,'' said Eva, quickly; <div class="bookquote">``and if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) buys you, you will have good times.
<p/>The boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and Eva, hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father's voice, bounded nimbly away.
<p/>I mean to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), this very day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, my little lady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom. Tom rose up, and went forward to offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) service in wooding, and soon was busy among the hands.
<p/>Eva and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father were standing together by the railings to see the boat start from the landing-place, the wheel had made two or three revolutions in the water, when, by some sudden movement, the little one suddenly lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into the water.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father, scarce knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did, was plunging in after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), but was held back by some behind him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), who saw that more efficient aid had followed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) child.
<p/>Tom was standing just under her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) on the lower deck, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) fell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) strike the water, and sink, and was after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) in a moment.
<p/>A broad-chested, strong-armed fellow, it was nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to keep afloat in the water, till, in a moment or two the child rose to the surface, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arms, and, swimming with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) to the boat-side, handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) up, all dripping, to the grasp of hundreds of hands, which, as if they had all belonged to one man, were stretched eagerly out to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
<p/>A few moments more, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), dripping and senseless, to the ladies' cabin, where, as is usual in cases of the kind, there ensued a very well-meaning and kind-hearted strife among the female occupants generally, as to who should do the most things to make a disturbance, and to hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) recovery in every way possible.
<p/>A general bustle of expectation and preparation was spread through the boat; in the cabin, one and another were gathering their things together, and arranging them, preparatory to going ashore.
<p/>The steward and chambermaid, and all, were busily engaged in cleaning, furbishing, and arranging the splendid boat, preparatory to a grand entree.
<p/>On the lower deck sat our friend Tom, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arms folded, and anxiously, from time to time, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes towards a group on the other side of the boat.
<p/>There stood the fair Evangeline, a little paler than the day before, but otherwise exhibiting no traces of the accident which had befallen her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangeline</b></font>).
<p/>A graceful, elegantly-formed young man stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangeline</b></font>), carelessly leaning one elbow on a bale of cotton while a large pocket-book lay open before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>It was a sultry, close day, the next day, as the steamer drew near to New Orleans. It was quite evident, at a glance, that the gentleman was Eva's father.
<p/>There was the same noble cast of head, the same large blue eyes, the same golden-brown hair; yet the expression was wholly different.
<p/>In the large, clear blue eyes, though in form and color exactly similar, there was wanting that misty, dreamy depth of expression; all was clear, bold, and bright, but with a light wholly of this world: the beautifully cut mouth had a proud and somewhat sarcastic expression, while an air of free-and-easy superiority sat not ungracefully in every turn and movement of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fine form.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was listening, with a good-humored, negligent air, half comic, half contemptuous, to Haley, who was very volubly expatiating on the quality of the article for which they were bargaining.
<p/>Well, now, my good fellow, what's the damage, as they say in Kentucky; in short, what's to be paid out for this business?
<p/>'' All the moral and Christian virtues bound in black Morocco, complete!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) said, when Haley had finished. '' How much are you going to cheat me, now?
<p/>Out with it!'' <div class="bookquote">``Wal,''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div>said Haley, <div class="bookquote">``if I should say thirteen hundred dollars for that ar fellow, I shouldn't but just save myself
<p/>; I shouldn't, now, re`ly.''  (<font color='red'><b>Haley/Mr. Haley</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Poor fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) keen, mocking blue eye on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but I suppose you'd let me have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for that, out of a particular regard for me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' Well, the young lady here seems to be sot on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and nat`lly enough.'' <div class="bookquote">``O! certainly, there's a call on your benevolence, my friend.
<p/>Now, as a matter of Christian charity, how cheap could you afford to let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) go, to oblige a young lady that's particular sot on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wal, now, just think on `t,''  (<font color='red'><b>the trader</b></font>)</div>said the trader; ``just look at them limbs,--broad-chested, strong as a horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Bad, bad, very bad; knows altogether too much!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, with the same mocking smile playing about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wal, there might be something in that ar, if it warnt for his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) character; but I can show recommends from his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) master and others, to prove he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) is one of your real pious,--the most humble, prayin, pious crittur ye ever did see.

<p/>If the trader had not been sure, by a certain good-humored twinkle in the large eye, that all this banter was sure, in the long run, to turn out a cash concern, he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) might have been somewhat out of patience; as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>) laid down a greasy pocket-book on the cotton-bales, and began anxiously studying over certain papers in it, the young man standing by, the while, looking down on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with an air of careless, easy drollery.

<p/>It was not in nature to look into that gay, young, handsome face, without a feeling of pleasure; and Tom felt the tears start in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, heartily, <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, Mas`r!''

<p/>Since the thread of our humble hero's life has now become interwoven with that of higher ones, it is necessary to give some brief introduction to them.
<p/>CHAPTER XV Of Tom's New Master, and Various Other Matters Augustine St. Clare was the son of a wealthy planter of Louisiana.
<p/>Of two brothers, very similar in temperament and character, one had settled on a flourishing farm in Vermont, and the other became an opulent planter in Louisiana.
<p/>The mother of Augustine was a Huguenot French lady, whose family had emigrated to Louisiana during the days of its early settlement.
<p/>Having inherited from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mother an exceeding delicacy of constitution, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was, at the instance of physicians, during many years of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) boyhood, sent to the care of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) uncle in Vermont, in order that his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) constitution might be strengthened by the cold of a more bracing climate.
<p/>In childhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was remarkable for an extreme and marked sensitiveness of character, more akin to the softness of woman than the ordinary hardness of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own sex.
<p/>Time, however, overgrew this softness with the rough bark of manhood, and but few knew how living and fresh it still lay at the core.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) talents were of the very first order, although his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind showed a preference always for the ideal and the aesthetic, and there was about him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that repugnance to the actual business of life which is the common result of this balance of the faculties.
<p/>Soon after the completion of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) college course, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) whole nature was kindled into one intense and passionate effervescence of romantic passion.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hour came,--the hour that comes only once; his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) star rose in the horizon,--that star that rises so often in vain, to be remembered only as a thing of dreams; and it rose for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in vain.
<p/>To drop the figure,--he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) saw and won the love of a high-minded and beautiful woman, in one of the northern states, and they were affianced.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) returned south to make arrangements for their marriage, when, most unexpectedly, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) letters were returned to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) by mail, with a short note from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) guardian, stating to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that ere this reached him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) the lady would be the wife of another.
<p/>Stung to madness, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) vainly hoped, as many another has done, to fling the whole thing from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) heart by one desperate effort.
<p/>Too proud to supplicate or seek explanation, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) threw himself at once into a whirl of fashionable society, and in a fortnight from the time of the fatal letter was the accepted lover of the reigning belle of the season; and as soon as arrangements could be made, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) became the husband of a fine figure, a pair of bright dark eyes, and a hundred thousand dollars; and, of course, everybody thought him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) a happy fellow.
<p/>The married couple were enjoying their honeymoon, and entertaining a brilliant circle of friends in their splendid villa, near Lake Pontchartrain, when, one day, a letter was brought to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) in that well-remembered writing.
<p/>It was handed to him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was in full tide of gay and successful conversation, in a whole room-full of company.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) turned deadly pale when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) saw the writing, but still preserved his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) composure, and finished the playful warfare of badinage which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was at the moment carrying on with a lady opposite; and, a short time after, was missed from the circle.
<p/>The family had its origin in Canada. Augustine and another brother were the only children of their parents. In his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) room, alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) opened and read the letter, now worse than idle and useless to be read.
<p/>It was from her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>), giving a long account of a persecution to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) had been exposed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) guardian's family, to lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) to unite herself with their son: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) related how, for a long time, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) letters had ceased to arrive; how she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) had written time and again, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) became weary and doubtful; how her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) health had failed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) anxieties, and how, at last, she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) had discovered the whole fraud which had been practised on them both.
<p/>The letter ended with expressions of hope and thankfulness, and professions of undying affection, which were more bitter than death to the unhappy young man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) immediately: <div class="bookquote">``I have received yours,--but too late. I believed all I heard. I was desperate. I am married , and all is over.
<p/>Only forget,--it is all that remains for either of us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And thus ended the whole romance and ideal of life for Augustine St. Clare.
<p/>But the real remained,--the real , like the flat, bare, oozy tide-mud, when the blue sparkling wave, with all its company of gliding boats and white-winged ships, its music of oars and chiming waters, has gone down, and there it lies, flat, slimy, bare,--exceedingly real.
<p/>Of course, in a novel, people's hearts break, and they die, and that is the end of it; and in a story this is very convenient.
<p/>There is a most busy and important round of eating, drinking, dressing, walking, visiting, buying, selling, talking, reading, and all that makes up what is commonly called living , yet to be gone through; and this yet remained to Augustine.
<p/>Had his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) wife been a whole woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) might yet have done something--as woman can--to mend the broken threads of life, and weave again into a tissue of brightness.
<p/>But in real life we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us. But Marie St. Clare could not even see that they had been broken.
<p/>As before stated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) consisted of a fine figure, a pair of splendid eyes, and a hundred thousand dollars; and none of these items were precisely the ones to minister to a mind diseased.
<p/>When Augustine, pale as death, was found lying on the sofa, and pleaded sudden sick-headache as the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) distress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) recommended to him (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) to smell of hartshorn; and when the paleness and headache came on week after week, she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) only said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) never thought Mr. St. Clare was sickly; but it seems he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was very liable to sick-headaches, and that it was a very unfortunate thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) didn't enjoy going into company with her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>), and it seemed odd to go so much alone, when they were just married.
<p/>Augustine was glad in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had married so undiscerning a woman; but as the glosses and civilities of the honeymoon wore away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) discovered that a beautiful young woman, who has lived all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life to be caressed and waited on, might prove quite a hard mistress in domestic life.
<p/>Marie never had possessed much capability of affection, or much sensibility, and the little that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had, had been merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness; a selfishness the more hopeless, from its quiet obtuseness, its utter ignorance of any claims but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own.
<p/>From her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) infancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been surrounded with servants, who lived only to study her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) caprices; the idea that they had either feelings or rights had never dawned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), even in distant perspective.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father, whose only child she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been, had never denied her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) anything that lay within the compass of human possibility; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) entered life, beautiful, accomplished, and an heiress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had, of course, all the eligibles and non-eligibles of the other sex sighing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) feet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had no doubt that Augustine was a most fortunate man in having obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>).
<p/>It is a great mistake to suppose that a woman with no heart will be an easy creditor in the exchange of affection.
<p/>There is not on earth a more merciless exactor of love from others than a thoroughly selfish woman; and the more unlovely she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grows,
<p/>When, therefore, St. Clare began to drop off those gallantries and small attentions which flowed at first through the habitude of courtship, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sultana no way ready to resign her (<font color='blue'><b>sultana</b></font>) slave; there were abundance of tears, poutings, and small tempests, there were discontents, pinings, upbraidings.
<p/>St. Clare was good-natured and self-indulgent, and sought to buy off with presents and flatteries; and when Marie became mother to a beautiful daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really felt awakened, for a time, to something like tenderness.
<p/>St. Clare's mother had been a woman of uncommon elevation and purity of character, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) gave to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) child his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mother's name, fondly fancying that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would prove a reproduction of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) image.
<p/>The thing had been remarked with petulant jealousy by his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband's absorbing devotion to the child with suspicion and dislike; all that was given to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seemed so much taken from herself.
<p/>the more jealously and scrupulously she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) exacts love, to the uttermost farthing. From the time of the birth of this child, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) health gradually sunk.
<p/>A life of constant inaction, bodily and mental,--the friction of ceaseless ennui and discontent, united to the ordinary weakness which attended the period of maternity,--in course of a few years changed the blooming young belle into a yellow faded, sickly woman, whose time was divided among a variety of fanciful diseases, and who considered herself, in every sense, the most ill-used and suffering person in existence.
<p/>There was no end of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) various complaints; but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) principal forte appeared to lie in sick-headache, which sometimes would confine her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) room three days out of six.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only daughter was exceedingly delicate, and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feared that, with no one to look after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) health and life might yet fall a sacrifice to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother's inefficiency.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on a tour to Vermont, and had persuaded his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousin, Miss Ophelia St. Clare, to return with him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) southern residence; and they are now returning on this boat, where we have introduced them to our readers.
<p/>And now, while the distant domes and spires of New Orleans rise to our view, there is yet time for an introduction to Miss Ophelia.
<p/>Whoever has travelled in the New England States will remember, in some cool village, the large farmhouse, with its clean-swept grassy yard, shaded by the dense and massive foliage of the sugar maple; and remember the air of order and stillness, of perpetuity and unchanging repose, that seemed to breathe over the whole place.
<p/>Nothing lost, or out of order; not a picket loose in the fence, not a particle of litter in the turfy yard, with its clumps of lilac bushes growing up under the windows.
<p/>Within, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) will remember wide, clean rooms, where nothing ever seems to be doing or going to be done, where everything is once and forever rigidly in place, and where all household arrangements move with the punctual exactness of the old clock in the corner.
<p/>In the family <div class="bookquote">``keeping-room,''  (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div>as it is termed, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) will remember the staid, respectable old book-case, with its glass doors, where Rollin's History,
<p/>As, of course, all family arrangements fell into the hands of servants, St. Clare found his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) menage anything but comfortable. * Milton's Paradise Lost, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress, and Scott's Family Bible,
<p/>There are no servants in the house, but the lady in the snowy cap, with the spectacles, who sits sewing every afternoon among her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughters, as if nothing ever had been done, or were to be done,--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) girls, in some long-forgotten fore part of the day, '' did up the work ,'' and for the rest of the time, probably, at all hours when you would see them, it is '' done up .
<p/>The old kitchen floor never seems stained or spotted; the tables, the chairs, and the various cooking utensils, never seem deranged or disordered; though three and sometimes four meals a day are got there, though the family washing and ironing is there performed, and though pounds of butter and cheese are in some silent and mysterious manner there brought into existence.
<p/>** stand side by side in decorous order, with multitudes of other books, equally solemn and respectable. '' * The Ancient History , ten volumes -LRB-1730-1738-RRB-, by the French historian Charles Rollin -LRB-1661-1741-RRB-.
<p/>On such a farm, in such a house and family, Miss Ophelia had spent a quiet existence of some forty-five years, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) cousin invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) southern mansion.
<p/>The eldest of a large family, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was still considered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) father and mother as one of <div class="bookquote">``the children,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>and the proposal that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) should go to Orleans was a most momentous one to the family circle.
<p/>The old gray-headed father took down Morse's Atlas* out of the book-case, and looked out the exact latitude and longitude; and read Flint's Travels in the South and West,
<p/>* * Scott's Family Bible -LRB-1788-1792-RRB-, edited with notes by the English Biblical commentator, Thomas Scott -LRB-1747-1821-RRB-. ** to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Scott</b></font>) own mind as to the nature of the country.

<p/>The good mother inquired, anxiously, <div class="bookquote">``if Orleans wasn't an awful wicked place,''  (<font color='red'><b>The mother</b></font>)</div>saying, ``that it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) most equal to going to the Sandwich Islands, or anywhere among the heathen.
<p/>It was known at the minister's and at the doctor's, and at Miss Peabody's milliner shop, that Ophelia St. Clare was <div class="bookquote">``talking about''  (<font color='red'><b>Ophelia St. Clare</b></font>)</div>going away down to Orleans with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) cousin; and of course the whole village could do no less than help this very important process of talking about the matter.
<p/>The minister, who inclined strongly to abolitionist views, was quite doubtful whether such a step might not tend somewhat to encourage the southerners in holding on to their slaves; while the doctor, who was a stanch colonizationist, inclined to the opinion that Miss Ophelia ought to go, to show the Orleans people that we don't think hardly of them, after all.
<p/>When however, the fact that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had resolved to go was fully before the public mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was solemnly invited out to tea by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) friends and neighbors for the space of a fortnight, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) prospects and plans duly canvassed and inquired into.
<p/>Miss Moseley, who came into the house to help to do the dress-making, acquired daily accessions of importance from the developments with regard to Miss Ophelia's wardrobe which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had been enabled to make.
<p/>It was credibly ascertained that Squire Sinclare, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) name was commonly contracted in the neighborhood, had counted out fifty dollars, and given them to Miss Ophelia, and told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to buy any clothes she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) thought best; and that two new silk dresses, and a bonnet, had been sent for from Boston.
<p/>As to the propriety of this extraordinary outlay, the public mind was divided,--some affirming that it was well enough, all things considered, for once in one's life, and others stoutly affirming that the money had better have been sent to the missionaries; but all parties agreed that there had been no such parasol seen in those parts as had been sent on from New York, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had one silk dress that might fairly be trusted to stand alone, whatever might be said of its mistress.
<p/>There were credible rumors, also, of a hemstitched pocket-handkerchief; and report even went so far as to state that Miss Ophelia had one pocket-handkerchief with lace all around it,--it was even added that it was worked in the corners; but this latter point was never satisfactorily ascertained, and remains, in fact, unsettled to this day.
<p/>Miss Ophelia, as you now behold her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), stands before you, in a very shining brown linen travelling-dress, tall, square-formed, and angular.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) face was thin, and rather sharp in its outlines; the lips compressed, like those of a person who is in the habit of making up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) mind definitely on all subjects; while the keen, dark eyes had a peculiarly searching, advised movement, and travelled over everything, as if they were looking for something to take care of.
<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) movements were sharp, decided, and energetic; and, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was never much of a talker, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) words were remarkably direct, and to the purpose, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) did speak.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) was of opinion, in fact, that southern people needed encouraging. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) habits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was a living impersonation of order, method, and exactness.
<p/>In punctuality, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was as inevitable as a clock, and as inexorable as a railroad engine; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) held in most decided contempt and abomination anything of a contrary character.
<p/>The great sin of sins, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) eyes,--the sum of all evils,--was expressed by one very common and important word in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) vocabulary--``shiftlessness.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) finale and ultimatum of contempt consisted in a very emphatic pronunciation of the word <div class="bookquote">``shiftless;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and by this she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) characterized all modes of procedure which had not a direct and inevitable relation to accomplishment of some purpose then definitely had in mind.
<p/>People who did nothing, or who did not know exactly what they were going to do, or who did not take the most direct way to accomplish what they set their hands to, were objects of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) entire contempt,--a contempt shown less frequently by anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said, than by a kind of stony grimness, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) scorned to say anything about the matter.
<p/>As to mental cultivation,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had a clear, strong, active mind, was well and thoroughly read in history and the older English classics, and thought with great strength within certain narrow limits.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) theological tenets were all made up, labelled in most positive and distinct forms, and put by, like the bundles in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) patch trunk; there were just so many of them, and there were never to be any more.
<p/>So, also, were her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) ideas with regard to most matters of practical life,--such as housekeeping in all its branches, and the various political relations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) native village.
<p/>'' And, underlying all, deeper than anything else, higher and broader, lay the strongest principle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) being--conscientiousness. Nowhere is conscience so dominant and all-absorbing as with New England women.
<p/>It is the granite formation, which lies deepest, and rises out, even to the tops of the highest mountains. Miss Ophelia was the absolute bond-slave of the '' ought .
<p/>Once make her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) certain that the <div class="bookquote">``path of duty,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) commonly phrased it, lay in any given direction, and fire and water could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) from it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would walk straight down into a well, or up to a loaded cannon's mouth, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) were only quite sure that there the path lay.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) standard of right was so high, so all-embracing, so minute, and making so few concessions to human frailty, that, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) strove with heroic ardor to reach it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) never actually did so, and of course was burdened with a constant and often harassing sense of deficiency;--this
<p/>'' gave a severe and somewhat gloomy cast to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) religious character. But, how in the world can Miss Ophelia get along with Augustine St. Clare,--gay, easy, unpunctual, unpractical,
<p/>sceptical,--in short,--walking with impudent and nonchalant freedom over every one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) most cherished habits and opinions? To tell the truth, then, Miss Ophelia loved him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
<p/>When a boy, it had been hers to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) catechism, mend his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) clothes, comb his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hair, and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) up generally in the way he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should go; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) heart having a warm side to it, Augustine had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) usually did with most people, monopolized a large share of it for himself, and therefore it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) succeeded very easily in persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) that the <div class="bookquote">``path of duty''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>lay in the direction of New Orleans, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) must go with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to take care of Eva, and keep everything from going to wreck and ruin during the frequent illnesses of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife.
<p/>The idea of a house without anybody to take care of it went to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart; then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved the lovely little girl, as few could help doing; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) regarded Augustine as very much of a heathen, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) jokes, and forbore with his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) failings, to an extent which those who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thought perfectly incredible.
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is, sitting now in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) state-room, surrounded by a mixed multitude of little and big carpet-bags, boxes, baskets, each containing some separate responsibility which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is tying, binding up, packing, or fastening, with a face of great earnestness.
<p/>But what more or other is to be known of Miss Ophelia our reader must discover by a personal acquaintance. ''
<p/>Now, Eva, have you kept count of your things? Of course you haven't,--children never do: there's the spotted carpet-bag and the little blue band-box with your best
<p/>; then the India rubber satchel is three; and my tape and needle box is four; and my band-box, five; and my collar-box; and that little hair trunk, seven.
<p/>Give it to me, and let me put a paper round it, and tie it to my umbrella with my shade;--there, now.

 (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div><p/>To keep it nice, child; people must take care of their things, if they ever mean to have anything; and now, Eva, is your thimble put up?''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Really, aunty, I don't know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, never mind ; I'll look your box over,--thimble, wax, two spools, scissors, knife, tape-needle; all right,--put it in here.
<p/>What did you ever do, child, when you were coming on with only your papa. I should have thought you'd a lost everything you had.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, aunty, I did lose a great many; and then, when we stopped anywhere, papa would buy some more of whatever it was.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Mercy on us, child,--what a way!''  (<font color='red'><b>aunty</b></font>)</div>'' It was a very easy way, aunty,'' said Eva. '' It's a dreadful shiftless one,'' said aunty.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must shut down,''  (<font color='red'><b>aunty</b></font>)</div>said aunty, with the air of a general, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) squeezed the things in, and sprung upon the lid;--still a little gap remained about the mouth of the trunk.
<p/>'' Why, aunty, what'll you do now?'' said Eva; <div class="bookquote">``that trunk is too full to be shut down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>'' Get up here, Eva!'' said Miss Ophelia, courageously; <div class="bookquote">``what has been done can be done again.
<p/>This trunk has got to be shut and locked--there are no two ways about it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>And the trunk, intimidated, doubtless, by this resolute statement, gave in.
<p/>The hasp snapped sharply in its hole, and Miss Ophelia turned the key, and pocketed it in triumph. '' Now we're ready.
<p/>Where's your papa? I think it time this baggage was set out. Do look out, Eva, and see if you see your papa.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)'s down the other end of the gentlemen's cabin, eating an orange.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) can't know how near we are coming,'' said aunty; <div class="bookquote">``hadn't you better run and speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>aunty</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Papa never is in a hurry about anything,'' said Eva, <div class="bookquote">``and we haven't come to the landing. Do step on the guards, aunty.
<p/>The boat now began, with heavy groans, like some vast, tired monster, to prepare to push up among the multiplied steamers at the levee.
<p/>Look! there's our house, up that street!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>Eva joyously pointed out the various spires, domes, and way-marks, by which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) recognized her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) native city.
<p/>'' Yes, yes, dear; very fine,'' said Miss Ophelia. '' But mercy on us! the boat has stopped! where is your father?
<p/>And now ensued the usual turmoil of landing--waiters running twenty ways at once--men tugging trunks, carpet-bags, boxes--women anxiously calling to their children, and
<p/>Miss Ophelia seated herself resolutely on the lately vanquished trunk, and marshalling all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) goods and chattels in fine military order, seemed resolved to defend them to the last.
<p/>'' everybody crowding in a dense mass to the plank towards the landing. '' Shall I take your trunk, ma'am?'' ''
<p/>Shall I take your baggage?'' <div class="bookquote">``Let me `tend to your baggage, Missis?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Shan't I carry out these yer, Missis? '' rained down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) unheeded.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) sat with grim determination, upright as a darning-needle stuck in a board, holding on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) bundle of umbrella and parasols, and replying with a determination that was enough to strike dismay even into a hackman, wondering to Eva, in each interval, <div class="bookquote">``what upon earth her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) papa could be thinking of; he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) couldn't have fallen over, now,--but something must have happened;'' (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>--and just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had begun to work herself into a real distress, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) came up, with his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) usually careless motion, and giving Eva a quarter of the orange he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) was eating, said, <div class="bookquote">``Well, Cousin Vermont, I suppose you are all ready.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've been ready, waiting, nearly an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia; <div class="bookquote">``I began to be really concerned about you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>That's a clever fellow, now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>Well, the carriage is waiting, and the crowd are now off, so that one can walk out in a decent and Christian manner, and not be pushed and shoved.
<p/>'' Here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) added to a driver who stood behind him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``take these things. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll go and see to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) putting them in,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>Well, at any rate, I'll carry this, and this, and this,'' said Miss Ophelia, singling out three boxes and a small carpet-bag.
<p/>'' O, pshaw, cousin, what's the use?'' said St. Clare. '' '' My dear Miss Vermont, positively you mustn't come the Green Mountains over us that way.
<p/>They'll take you for a waiting-maid; give them to this fellow; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'ll put them down as if they were eggs, now.
<p/>Miss Ophelia looked despairingly as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) cousin took all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) treasures from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), and rejoiced to find herself once more in the carriage with them, in a state of preservation.
<p/>You must adopt at least a piece of a southern principle, and not walk out under all that load. '' ''
<p/>I'm going to take Tom up to mother for a peace-offering, to make up for that drunken fellow that upset the carriage.
<p/>Where's Tom? '' said Eva. '' O, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s on the outside, Pussy. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, Tom will make a splendid driver, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll never get drunk.
<p/>The carriage stopped in front of an ancient mansion, built in that odd mixture of Spanish and French style, of which there are specimens in some parts of New Orleans.
<p/>It was built in the Moorish fashion,--a square building enclosing a court-yard, into which the carriage drove through an arched gateway.
<p/>Wide galleries ran all around the four sides, whose Moorish arches, slender pillars, and arabesque ornaments, carried the mind back, as in a dream, to the reign of oriental romance in Spain.
<p/>In the middle of the court, a fountain threw high its silvery water, falling in a never-ceasing spray into a marble basin, fringed with a deep border of fragrant violets.
<p/>The water in the fountain, pellucid as crystal, was alive with myriads of gold and silver fishes, twinkling and darting through it like so many living jewels.
<p/>Around the fountain ran a walk, paved with a mosaic of pebbles, laid in various fanciful patterns; and this, again, was surrounded by turf, smooth as green velvet, while a carriage-drive enclosed the whole.
<p/>Two large orange-trees, now fragrant with blossoms, threw a delicious shade; and, ranged in a circle round upon the turf, were marble vases of arabesque sculpture, containing the choicest flowering plants of the tropics.
<p/>Huge pomegranate trees, with their glossy leaves and flame-colored flowers, dark-leaved Arabian jessamines, with their silvery stars, geraniums, luxuriant roses bending beneath their heavy abundance of flowers, golden jessamines, lemon-scented verbenum, all united their bloom and fragrance, while here and there a mystic old aloe, with its strange, massive leaves,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>The court, in the inside, had evidently been arranged to gratify a picturesque and voluptuous ideality. sat looking like some old enchanter, sitting in weird grandeur among the more perishable bloom and fragrance around it.
<p/>The galleries that surrounded the court were festooned with a curtain of some kind of Moorish stuff, and could be drawn down at pleasure, to exclude the beams of the sun.
<p/>As the carriage drove in, Eva seemed like a bird ready to burst from a cage, with the wild eagerness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) delight.
<p/>On the whole, the appearance of the place was luxurious and romantic. '' O, isn't it beautiful, lovely! my own dear, darling home!
<p/>'' '''T is a pretty place,'' said Miss Ophelia, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) alighted; <div class="bookquote">``though it looks rather old and heathenish to me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said to Miss Ophelia. '' Isn't it beautiful? '' Tom got down from the carriage, and looked about with an air of calm, still enjoyment.
<p/>The negro, it must be remembered, is an exotic of the most gorgeous and superb countries of the world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) has, deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) heart, a passion for all that is splendid, rich, and fanciful; a passion which, rudely indulged by an untrained taste, draws on them the ridicule of the colder and more correct white race.
<p/>St. Clare, who was in heart a poetical voluptuary, smiled as Miss Ophelia made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) remark on his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) premises, and, turning to Tom, who was standing looking round, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) beaming black face perfectly radiant with admiration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Tom, my boy, this seems to suit you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All this passed in a moment, while trunks were being hustled off, hackman paid, and while a crowd, of all ages and sizes,--men, women, and children,--came running through the galleries, both above and below to see Mas'r come in.
<p/>Foremost among them was a highly-dressed young mulatto man, evidently a very distingue personage, attired in the ultra extreme of the mode, and gracefully waving a scented cambric handkerchief in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
<p/>This personage had been exerting himself, with great alacrity, in driving all the flock of domestics to the other end of the verandah.
<p/>'' Yes, Mas`r, it looks about the right thing,'' said Tom. '' Back! all of you. I am ashamed of you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, in a tone of authority.
<p/>All looked abashed at this elegant speech, delivered with quite an air, and stood huddled together at a respectful distance, except two stout porters, who came up and began conveying away the baggage.
<p/>Owing to Mr. Adolph's systematic arrangements, when St. Clare turned round from paying the hackman, there was nobody in view but Mr. Adolph himself, conspicuous in satin vest, gold guard-chain, and white pants, and bowing with inexpressible grace and suavity.
<p/>Ah, Adolph, is it you?'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) master, offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``how are you, boy?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>while Adolph poured forth, with great fluency, an extemporary speech, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) had been preparing, with great care, for a fortnight before.
<p/>'' Would you intrude on Master's domestic relations, in the first hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) return? '' '' '' Well, well,'' said St. Clare, passing on, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) usual air of negligent drollery, <div class="bookquote">``that's very well got up, Adolph.
<p/>I'll come to the people in a minute;''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>and, so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) led Miss Ophelia to a large parlor that opened on the verandah.
<p/>While this had been passing, Eva had flown like a bird, through the porch and parlor, to a little boudoir opening likewise on the verandah.
<p/>See that the baggage is well bestowed. A tall, dark-eyed, sallow woman, half rose from a couch on which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was reclining.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, in a sort of a rapture, throwing herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) neck, and embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) over and over again.
<p/>'' That'll do,--take care, child,--don't , you make my head ache,'' said the mother, after she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had languidly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). St. Clare came in, embraced his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wife in true, orthodox, husbandly fashion, and then presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cousin.
<p/>A crowd of servants now pressed to the entry door, and among them a middle-aged mulatto woman, of very respectable appearance, stood foremost, in a tremor of expectation and joy, at the door.
<p/>Marie lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) large eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) cousin with an air of some curiosity, and received her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) with languid politeness. ''
<p/>O, there's Mammy! '' said Eva, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) flew across the room; and, throwing herself into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) repeatedly.
<p/>This woman did not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) head ache, but, on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) hugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), and laughed, and cried, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) sanity was a thing to be doubted of; and when released from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), Eva flew from one to another, shaking hands and kissing, in a way that Miss Ophelia afterwards declared fairly turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) stomach.
<p/>'' Well!'' said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``you southern children can do something that I couldn't. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What, now, pray?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare.
<p/>Well, I want to be kind to everybody, and I wouldn't have anything hurt; but as to kissing--'' <div class="bookquote">``Niggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``that you're not up to,--hey?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Yes, that's it. How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)? '' St. Clare laughed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) went into the passage. '' Halloa, here, what's to pay out here?
<p/>Here, you all--Mammy, Jimmy, Polly, Sukey--glad to see Mas`r? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) went shaking hands from one to another.
<p/>Look out for the babies!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) added, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) stumbled over a sooty little urchin, who was crawling upon all fours.
<p/>'' '' If I step upon anybody, let 'em mention it. '' There was an abundance of laughing and blessing Mas`r, as St. Clare distributed small pieces of change among them.
<p/>Come, now, take yourselves off, like good boys and girls,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) said; and the whole assemblage, dark and light, disappeared through a door into a large verandah, followed by Eva, who carried a large satchel, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had been filling with apples, nuts, candy, ribbons, laces, and toys of every description, during her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) whole homeward journey.
<p/>As St. Clare turned to go back his (<font color='blue'><b>Jimmy</b></font>) eye fell upon Tom, who was standing uneasily, shifting from one foot to the other, while Adolph stood negligently leaning against the banisters, examining Tom through an opera-glass, with an air that would have done credit to any dandy living.
<p/>'' '' Puh! you puppy,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master, striking down the opera glass; <div class="bookquote">``is that the way you treat your company?
<p/>Seems to me, Dolph,''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) finger on the elegant figured satin vest that Adolph was sporting, <div class="bookquote">``seems to me that's my vest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O! Master, this vest all stained with wine; of course, a gentleman in Master's standing never wears a vest like this.
<p/>I understood I was to take it. It does for a poor nigger-fellow, like me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>And Adolph tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) head, and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) fingers through his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) scented hair, with a grace.
<p/>Well, here, I'm going to show this Tom to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mistress, and then you take him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the kitchen; and mind you don't put on any of your airs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>'' So, that's it, is it?'' said St. Clare, carelessly. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s worth two such puppies as you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Master always will have his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) joke,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>said Adolph, laughing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) looked wistfully on the velvet carpets, and the before unimagined splendors of mirrors, pictures, statues, and curtains, and, like the Queen of Sheba before Solomon, there was no more spirit in him (<font color='blue'><b>Solomon</b></font>).
<p/>'' I'm delighted to see Master in such spirits.'' <div class="bookquote">``Here, Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, beckoning. Tom entered the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked afraid even to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feet down.
<p/>I tell you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s a regular hearse for blackness and sobriety, and will drive you like a funeral, if you want.
<p/>'' See here, Marie,'' said St. Clare to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wife, <div class="bookquote">``I've bought you a coachman, at last, to order. Open your eyes, now, and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>Now, don't say I never think about you when I'm gone. ''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>Marie opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) eyes, and fixed them on Tom, without rising.
<p/>'' I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll get drunk,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said. '' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s warranted a pious and sober article. '' '' Well, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) may turn out well,'' said the lady; <div class="bookquote">``it's more than I expect, though.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Dolph,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``show Tom down stairs; and, mind yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">``remember what I told you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Adolph tripped gracefully forward, and Tom, with lumbering tread, went after.
<p/>Come, now, Marie,'' said St. Clare, seating himself on a stool beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sofa, <div class="bookquote">``be gracious, and say something pretty to a fellow.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was a daguerreotype, clear and soft as an engraving, representing Eva and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father sitting hand in hand. Marie looked at it with a dissatisfied air.
<p/>'' What made you sit in such an awkward position? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said. '' Well, the position may be a matter of opinion; but what do you think of the likeness?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you don't think anything of my opinion in one case, I suppose you wouldn't in another,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the lady, shutting the daguerreotype.
<p/>Hang the woman!'' said St. Clare, mentally; but aloud he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Come, now, Marie, what do you think of the likeness?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Don't be nonsensical, now.'' '' It's very inconsiderate of you, St. Clare,'' said the lady, <div class="bookquote">``to insist on my talking and looking at things.

<p/>Juniper-berry tea is good for sick-headache,'' said Miss Ophelia; ``at least, Auguste, Deacon Abraham Perry's wife, used to say so; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was a great nurse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll have the first juniper-berries that get ripe in our garden by the lake brought in for that special purpose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, gravely pulling the bell as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) did so; <div class="bookquote">``meanwhile, cousin, you must be wanting to retire to your apartment, and refresh yourself a little, after your journey.

'' I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)'s welcome,'' said Marie, leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head languidly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hand.
<p/>I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'ll find one thing, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) does, and that is, that it's we mistresses that are the slaves, down here.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``O, certainly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) will discover that, and a world of wholesome truths besides, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare. '' Talk about our keeping slaves, as if we did it for our convenience ,'' said Marie.
<p/>Evangeline fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangeline</b></font>) large, serious eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangeline</b></font>) mother's face, with an earnest and perplexed expression, and said, simply, <div class="bookquote">``What do you keep them for, mamma?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I'm sure, if we consulted that , we might let them all go at once. '' '' I don't know, I'm sure, except for a plague; they are the plague of my life.
<p/>I believe that more of my ill health is caused by them than by any one thing; and ours, I know, are the very worst that ever anybody was plagued with.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, come, Marie, you've got the blues, this morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare. '' You know 't isn't so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mammy is the best I ever knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``and yet Mammy, now, is selfish--dreadfully selfish; it's the fault of the whole race.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, now, there's Mammy,'' said Marie, ``I think it's selfish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to sleep so sound nights; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) knows I need little attentions almost every hour, when my worst turns are on, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s so hard to wake.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Selfishness is a dreadful fault,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, gravely. '' I absolutely am worse, this very morning, for the efforts I had to make to wake her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) last night.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Hasn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sat up with you a good many nights, lately, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva. '' How should you know that?'' said Marie, sharply; ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s been complaining, I suppose.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you let Jane or Rosa take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) place, a night or two,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) rest?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) didn't complain; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) only told me what bad nights you'd had,--so many in succession.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``How can you propose it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie.
<p/>So nervous as I am, the least breath disturbs me; and a strange hand about me would drive me absolutely frantic.
<p/>'' St. Clare, you really are inconsiderate. If Mammy felt the interest in me she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ought to , she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'d wake easier,--of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would.
<p/>Miss Ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air of shrewd, observant gravity; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) still kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) lips tightly compressed, as if determined fully to ascertain her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) longitude and position, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) committed herself.
<p/>I've heard of people who had such devoted servants, but it never was my luck;'' and Marie sighed. '' Now, Mammy has a sort of goodness,'' said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s smooth and respectful, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s selfish at heart.
<p/>You see, when I was married and came to live here, of course, I had to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) with me, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) husband my father couldn't spare.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a blacksmith, and, of course, very necessary; and I thought and said, at the time, that Mammy and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had better give each other up, as it wasn't likely to be convenient for them ever to live together again.
<p/>I wish, now, I'd insisted on it, and married Mammy to somebody else; but I was foolish and indulgent, and didn't want to insist.
<p/>I told Mammy, at the time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mustn't ever expect to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more than once or twice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) life again, for the air of father's place doesn't agree with my health, and I can't go there; and I advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to take up with somebody else; but no--she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) wouldn't.
<p/>Now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) never will be done fidgeting and worrying about that husband of hers. Mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), in spots, that everybody don't see as I do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) children?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) has two.'' <div class="bookquote">``I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) feels the separation from them?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>They were little dirty things--I couldn't have them about; and, besides, they took up too much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) time; but I believe that Mammy has always kept up a sort of sulkiness about this.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) won't marry anybody else; and I do believe, now, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) knows how necessary she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) is to me, and how feeble my health is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) husband tomorrow, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) only could.
<p/>Well, of course, I couldn't bring them. I do , indeed,'' said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``they are just so selfish, now, the best of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Ophelia looked keenly at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and saw the flush of mortification and repressed vexation, and the sarcastic curl of the lip, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>'' It's distressing to reflect upon,'' said St. Clare, dryly. '' Now, Mammy has always been a pet with me,'' said Marie.
<p/>I wish some of your northern servants could look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) closets of dresses,--silks and muslins, and one real linen cambric, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) has hanging there.
<p/>'' I've worked sometimes whole afternoons, trimming her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) caps, and getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) ready to go to a party. As to abuse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) don't know what it is.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) never was whipped more than once or twice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) whole life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) has her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) strong coffee or her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) tea every day, with white sugar in it.
<p/>It's abominable, to be sure; but St. Clare will have high life below-stairs, and they every one of them live just as they please.
<p/>I suppose it is partly our fault that they are selfish, and act like spoiled children; but I've talked to St. Clare till I am tired.''
<p/>Eva, the beautiful Eva, had stood listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mother, with that expression of deep and mystic earnestness which was peculiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
<p/>The fact is, our servants are over-indulged. '' And I, too,'' said St. Clare, taking up the morning paper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) walked softly round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother's chair, and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) neck.
<p/>'' Well, Eva, what now?'' said Marie. '' Mamma, couldn't I take care of you one night--just one? I know I shouldn't make you nervous, and I shouldn't sleep.
<p/>I often lie awake nights, thinking-- '' <div class="bookquote">``O, nonsense, child--nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``you are such a strange child!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>'' But may I, mamma?
<p/>I think,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, timidly, <div class="bookquote">``that Mammy isn't well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) told me her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head ached all the time, lately.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, that's just one of Mammy's fidgets!
<p/>Mammy is just like all the rest of them--makes such a fuss about every little headache or finger-ache; it'll never do to encourage it--never!
<p/>If you encourage servants in giving way to every little disagreeable feeling, and complaining of every little ailment, you'll have your hands full.
<p/>I'm principled about this matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), turning to Miss Ophelia; <div class="bookquote">``you'll find the necessity of it. I never complain myself--nobody knows what I endure.
<p/>Miss Ophelia's round eyes expressed an undisguised amazement at this peroration, which struck St. Clare as so supremely ludicrous, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) burst into a loud laugh.
<p/>St. Clare always laughs when I make the least allusion to my ill health,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Marie, with the voice of a suffering martyr.
<p/>I feel it a duty to bear it quietly, and I do. '' '' '' I only hope the day won't come when he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>)'ll remember it!
<p/>'' and Marie put her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) eyes. Of course, there was rather a foolish silence. Finally, St. Clare got up, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) watch, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) had an engagement down street.
<p/>Now, that's just like St. Clare!'' said the latter, withdrawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to be affected by it was no longer in sight.
<p/>Eva tripped away after him (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>), and Miss Ophelia and Marie remained at the table alone. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) never realizes, never can, never will, what I suffer, and have, for years.
<p/>If I was one of the complaining sort, or ever made any fuss about my ailments, there would be some reason for it.
<p/>But I've kept things to myself, and borne, and borne, till St. Clare has got in the way of thinking I can bear anything.
<p/>Men do get tired, naturally, of a complaining wife. '' Miss Ophelia did not exactly know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was expected to answer to this.
<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was thinking what to say, Marie gradually wiped away her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) tears, and smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) plumage in a general sort of way, as a dove might be supposed to make toilet after a shower, and began a housewifely chat with Miss Ophelia, concerning cupboards, closets, linen-presses, store-rooms, and other matters, of which the latter was, by common understanding, to assume the direction,--giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) so many cautious directions and charges, that a head less systematic and business-like than Miss Ophelia's would have been utterly dizzied and confounded.
<p/>And now,'' said Marie, <div class="bookquote">``I believe I've told you everything; so that, when my next sick turn comes on, you'll be able to go forward entirely, without consulting me;--only about Eva,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) requires watching.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) seems to be a good child, very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia; <div class="bookquote">``I never saw a better child.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eva's peculiar,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mother, <div class="bookquote">``very.
<p/>There are things about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) so singular; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) isn't like me, now, a particle;''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>and Marie sighed, as if this was a truly melancholy consideration.
<p/>Miss Ophelia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own heart said, <div class="bookquote">``I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>but had prudence enough to keep it down. '' Eva always was disposed to be with servants; and I think that well enough with some children.
<p/>Now, I always played with father's little negroes--it never did me any harm. But Eva somehow always seems to put herself on an equality with every creature that comes near her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
<p/>It's a strange thing about the child. I never have been able to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) of it. St. Clare, I believe, encourages her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) in it.
<p/>The fact is, St. Clare indulges every creature under this roof but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own wife. '' Again Miss Ophelia sat in blank silence.
<p/>'' Now, there's no way with servants,'' said Marie, <div class="bookquote">``but to put them down , and keep them down. It was always natural to me, from a child.
<p/>Eva is enough to spoil a whole house-full. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) will do when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) comes to keep house herself, I'm sure I don't know.
<p/>Eva never does; there's no getting into the child's head the first beginning of an idea what a servant's place is!
<p/>I hold to being kind to servants --I always am; but you must make 'em know their place . You heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) offering to take care of me nights, to let Mammy sleep!
<p/>That's just a specimen of the way the child would be doing all the time, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was left to herself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, bluntly, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose you think your servants are human creatures, and ought to have some rest when they are tired.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>'' Certainly, of course. I'm very particular in letting them have everything that comes convenient,--anything that doesn't put one at all out of the way, you know.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)'s the sleepiest concern that ever I saw; sewing, standing, or sitting, that creature will go to sleep, and sleep anywhere and everywhere.
<p/>Mammy can make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) sleep, some time or other; there's no difficulty about that. No danger but Mammy gets sleep enough.
<p/>But this treating servants as if they were exotic flowers, or china vases, is really ridiculous,'' said Marie, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) plunged languidly into the depths of a voluminous and pillowy lounge, and drew towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) an elegant cut-glass vinaigrette.
<p/>You see,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) continued, in a faint and lady-like voice, like the last dying breath of an Arabian jessamine, or something equally ethereal, <div class="bookquote">``you see, Cousin Ophelia, I don't often speak of myself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It isn't my habit ; 't isn't agreeable to me. In fact, I haven't strength to do it. But there are points where St. Clare and I differ.
<p/>St. Clare never understood me, never appreciated me. I think it lies at the root of all my ill health. St. Clare means well, I am bound to believe; but men are constitutionally selfish and inconsiderate to woman.
<p/>Miss Ophelia, who had not a small share of the genuine New England caution, and a very particular horror of being drawn into family difficulties, now began to foresee something of this kind impending; so, composing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) face into a grim neutrality, and drawing out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) pocket about a yard and a quarter of stocking, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) kept as a specific against what Dr. Watts asserts to be a personal habit of Satan when people have idle hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) proceeded to knit most energetically, shutting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) lips together in a way that said, as plain as words could, <div class="bookquote">``You needn't try to make me speak.
<p/>That, at least, is my impression. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I don't want anything to do with your affairs,''--in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) looked about as sympathizing as a stone lion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had got somebody to talk to, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) felt it her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) duty to talk, and that was enough; and reinforcing herself by smelling again at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) vinaigrette, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) went on.
<p/>You see, I brought my own property and servants into the connection, when I married St. Clare, and I am legally entitled to manage them my own way.
<p/>St. Clare had his (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) fortune and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) servants, and I'm well enough content he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) should manage them his (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) way; but St. Clare will be interfering.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) really does act as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) servants before me, and before himself, too; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) lets them make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) all sorts of trouble, and never lifts a finger.
<p/>But Marie didn't care for that. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) has wild, extravagant notions about things, particularly about the treatment of servants. Now, about some things, St. Clare is really frightful--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) frightens me--good-natured as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) looks, in general.
<p/>Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) has set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) foot that, come what will, there shall not be a blow struck in this house, except what he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) or I strike; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) does it in a way that I really dare not cross him (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).
<p/>Well, you may see what that leads to; for St. Clare wouldn't raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) hand, if every one of them walked over him (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), and I--
<p/>you see how cruel it would be to require me to make the exertion. Now, you know these servants are nothing but grown-up children.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything about it, and I thank the Lord that I don't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, shortly. '' Well, but you will have to know something, and know it to your cost, if you stay here.
<p/>Marie seemed wonderfully supported, always, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) got upon this topic; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) now opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) eyes, and seemed quite to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) languor.
<p/>You don't know what a provoking, stupid, careless, unreasonable, childish, ungrateful set of wretches they are. '' '' You don't know, and you can't, the daily, hourly trials that beset a housekeeper from them, everywhere and every way.
<p/>But it's no use to complain to St. Clare. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) talks the strangest stuff. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says we have made them what they are, and ought to bear with them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says their faults are all owing to us, and that it would be cruel to make the fault and punish it too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) says we shouldn't do any better, in their place; just as if one could reason from them to us, you know.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't you believe that the Lord made them of one blood with us?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, shortly. '' No, indeed not I!
<p/>A pretty story, truly! They are a degraded race. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't you think they've got immortal souls?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, with increasing indignation.
<p/>But as to putting them on any sort of equality with us, you know, as if we could be compared, why, it's impossible!
<p/>Now, St. Clare really has talked to me as if keeping Mammy from her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) husband was like keeping me from mine.
<p/>'' O, well,'' said Marie, yawning, <div class="bookquote">``that, of course--nobody doubts that. There's no comparing in this way. Mammy couldn't have the feelings that I should.
<p/>It's a different thing altogether,--of course, it is,--and yet St. Clare pretends not to see it. And just as if Mammy could love her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) little dirty babies as I love Eva!
<p/>Yet St. Clare once really and soberly tried to persuade me that it was my duty, with my weak health, and all I suffer, to let Mammy go back, and take somebody else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) place.
<p/>I don't often show my feelings, I make it a principle to endure everything in silence; it's a wife's hard lot, and I bear it.
<p/>That was a little too much even for me to bear. But I did break out, that time; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has never alluded to the subject since.
<p/>But I know by his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looks, and little things that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) says, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thinks so as much as ever; and it's so trying, so provoking!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Ophelia looked very much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) should say something; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) rattled away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) needles in a way that had volumes of meaning in it, if Marie could only have understood it.
<p/>A household without any rule; where servants have it all their own way, do what they please, and have what they please, except so far as I, with my feeble health, have kept up government.
<p/>I keep my cowhide about, and sometimes I do lay it on; but the exertion is always too much for me.
<p/>'' So, you just see,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``what you've got to manage. If St. Clare would only have this thing done as others do--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And how's that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, send them to the calaboose, or some of the other places to be flogged. That's the only way.
<p/>If I wasn't such a poor, feeble piece, I believe I should manage with twice the energy that St. Clare does.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' And how does St. Clare contrive to manage?'' said Miss Ophelia. '' You say he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never strikes a blow.
<p/>Well, men have a more commanding way, you know; it is easier for them; besides, if you ever looked full in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eye, it's peculiar,--that
<p/>'' '' eye,--and if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) speaks decidedly, there's a kind of flash. I'm afraid of it, myself; and the servants know they must mind.
<p/>I couldn't do as much by a regular storm and scolding as St. Clare can by one turn of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eye, if once he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is in earnest.
<p/>O, there's no trouble about St. Clare; that's the reason he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s no more feeling for me. But you'll find, when you come to manage, that there's no getting along without severity,--they
<p/>are so bad, so deceitful, so lazy.'' '' The old tune,'' said St. Clare, sauntering in. '' What an awful account these wicked creatures will have to settle, at last, especially for being lazy!
<p/>You see, cousin,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) stretched himself at full length on a lounge opposite to Marie, <div class="bookquote">``it's wholly inexcusable in them, in the light of the example that Marie and I set them,--this laziness.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, now, St. Clare, you are too bad!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie. '' Am I, now? Why, I thought I was talking good, quite remarkably for me.
<p/>I try to enforce your remarks, Marie, always.'' <div class="bookquote">``You know you meant no such thing, St. Clare,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie. '' O, I must have been mistaken, then.
<p/>O, come, Marie, the day is growing warm, and I have just had a long quarrel with Dolph, which has fatigued me excessively; so, pray be agreeable, now, and let a fellow repose in the light of your smile.
<p/>Thank you, my dear, for setting me right.'' <div class="bookquote">``You do really try to be provoking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie. '' '' '' What's the matter about Dolph?'' said Marie.
<p/>'' That fellow's impudence has been growing to a point that is perfectly intolerable to me. I only wish I had the undisputed management of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a while.
<p/>I'd bring him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) down!'' <div class="bookquote">``What you say, my dear, is marked with your usual acuteness and good sense,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare.
<p/>As to Dolph, the case is this: that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has so long been engaged in imitating my graces and perfections, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has, at last, really mistaken himself for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) master; and I have been obliged to give him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a little insight into his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mistake.
<p/>Why, I was obliged to let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) understand explicitly that I preferred to keep some of my clothes for my own personal wearing; also, I put his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) magnificence upon an allowance of cologne-water, and actually was so cruel as to restrict him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``How?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie. '' Dolph was particularly huffy about it, and I had to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) like a father, to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) round.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O! St. Clare, when will you learn how to treat your servants? It's abominable, the way you indulge them!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie.
<p/>Why, after all, what's the harm of the poor dog's wanting to be like his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) master; and if I haven't brought him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) up any better than to find his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chief good in cologne and cambric handkerchiefs, why shouldn't I give them to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?''
<p/>'' '' And why haven't you brought him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) up better?'' said Miss Ophelia, with blunt determination. '' Too much trouble,--laziness, cousin, laziness,--which ruins more souls than you can shake a stick at.
<p/>I'm inclined to think that laziness is what your old Dr. Botherem, up in Vermont, used to call the `essence of moral evil.'
<p/>If it weren't for laziness, I should have been a perfect angel, myself. It's an awful consideration, certainly.'' <div class="bookquote">``I think you slaveholders have an awful responsibility upon you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>You ought to educate your slaves, and treat them like reasonable creatures,--like immortal creatures, that you've got to stand before the bar of God with.
<p/>That's my mind,'' said the good lady, breaking suddenly out with a tide of zeal that had been gaining strength in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind all the morning.
<p/>'' I wouldn't have it, for a thousand worlds. '' O! come, come,'' said St. Clare, getting up quickly; <div class="bookquote">``what do you know about us?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sat down to the piano, and rattled a lively piece of music. St. Clare had a decided genius for music.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) touch was brilliant and firm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) fingers flew over the keys with a rapid and bird-like motion, airy, and yet decided.
<p/>After pushing the music aside, he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) rose up, and said, gayly, <div class="bookquote">``Well, now, cousin, you've given us a good talk and done your duty; on the whole, I think the better of you for it.
<p/>I make no manner of doubt that you threw a very diamond of truth at me, though you see it hit me so directly in the face that it wasn't exactly appreciated, at first.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) played piece after piece, like a man who is trying to play himself into a good humor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``For my part, I don't see any use in such sort of talk,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie.
<p/>I'm sure, if anybody does more for servants than we do, I'd like to know who; and it don't do 'em a bit
<p/>As to talking to them, or anything like that, I'm sure I have talked till I was tired and hoarse, telling them their duty, and all that; and I'm sure they can go to church when they like, though they don't understand a word of the sermon, more than so many pigs,--so it isn't of any great use for them to go, as I see; but they do go, and so they have every chance; but, as I said before, they are a degraded race, and always will be, and there isn't any help for them
<p/>'' good,--not a particle,--they get worse and worse. ; you can't make anything of them, if you try. You see, Cousin Ophelia, I've tried, and you haven't; I was born and bred among them, and I know.
<p/>'' Miss Ophelia thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had said enough, and therefore sat silent. St. Clare whistled a tune. '' St. Clare, I wish you wouldn't whistle,'' said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``it makes my head worse.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare. '' Is there anything else you wouldn't wish me to do?'' <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would have some kind of sympathy for my trials; you never have any feeling for me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>angel</b></font>)</div><p/>'' My dear accusing angel!'' said St. Clare. '' It's provoking to be talked to in that way. '' '' Then, how will you be talked to?
<p/>I'll talk to order,--any way you'll mention,--only to give satisfaction. '' A gay laugh from the court rang through the silken curtains of the verandah.
<p/>St. Clare stepped out, and lifting up the curtain, laughed too. '' What is it?'' said Miss Ophelia, coming to the railing.
<p/>There sat Tom, on a little mossy seat in the court, every one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) button-holes stuck full of cape jessamines, and Eva, gayly laughing, was hanging a wreath of roses round his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) sat down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knee, like a chip-sparrow, still laughing.
<p/>Tom had a sober, benevolent smile, and seemed, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) quiet way, to be enjoying the fun quite as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) little mistress.
<p/>'' O, Tom, you look so funny!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master, with a half-deprecating, apologetic air.
<p/>'' How can you let her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)?'' said Miss Ophelia. '' Why not?'' said St. Clare. '' Why, I don't know, it seems so dreadful!''
<p/>``You would think no harm in a child's caressing a large dog, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was black; but a creature that can think, and reason, and feel, and is immortal, you shudder at; confess it, cousin.
<p/>Not that there is a particle of virtue in our not having it; but custom with us does what Christianity ought to do,--obliterates the feeling of personal prejudice.
<p/>I know the feeling among some of you northerners well enough. I have often noticed, in my travels north, how much stronger this was with you than with us.
<p/>You loathe them as you would a snake or a toad, yet you are indignant at their wrongs. You would not have them abused; but you don't want to have anything to do with them yourselves.
<p/>You would send them to Africa, out of your sight and smell, and then send a missionary or two to do up all the self-denial of elevating them compendiously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What would the poor and lowly do, without children?''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, leaning on the railing, and watching Eva, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) tripped off, leading Tom with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
<p/>Isn't that it?'' '' Well, cousin,'' said Miss Ophelia, thoughtfully, <div class="bookquote">``there may be some truth in this. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>'' Your little child is your only true democrat.
<p/>Tom, now is a hero to Eva; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stories are wonders in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) songs and Methodist hymns are better than an opera, and the traps and little bits of trash in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket a mine of jewels, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the most wonderful Tom that ever wore a black skin.
<p/>This is one of the roses of Eden that the Lord has dropped down expressly for the poor and lowly, who get few enough of any other kind.''
<p/>'' It's strange, cousin,'' said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``one might almost think you were a professor , to hear you talk. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/>``Not at all; not a professor, as your town-folks have it; and, what is worse, I'm afraid, not a practiser , either.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A professor?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare. '' Yes; a professor of religion. '' '' '' What makes you talk so, then? '' <div class="bookquote">``Nothing is easier than talking,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare.
<p/>I believe Shakespeare makes somebody say, 'I could sooner show twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the twenty to follow my own showing.'
<p/>'' * Nothing like division of labor. My forte lies in talking, and yours, cousin, lies in doing. '' * The Merchant of Venice , Act 1, scene 2, lines 17-18.
<p/>In Tom's external situation, at this time, there was, as the world says, nothing to complain of Little Eva's fancy for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)--the instinctive gratitude and loveliness of a noble nature--had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) to petition her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) especial attendant, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) needed the escort of a servant, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) walks or rides; and Tom had general orders to let everything else go, and attend to Miss Eva whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),--orders which our readers may fancy were far from disagreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stable services were merely a sinecure, and consisted simply in a daily care and inspection, and directing an under-servant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) duties; for Marie St. Clare declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could not have any smell of the horses about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came near her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) must positively not be put to any service that would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) unpleasant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), as her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) nervous system was entirely inadequate to any trial of that nature; one snuff of anything disagreeable being, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) account, quite sufficient to close the scene, and put an end to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) earthly trials at once.
<p/>Tom, therefore, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) well-brushed broadcloth suit, smooth beaver, glossy boots, faultless wristbands and collar, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) grave, good-natured black face, looked respectable enough to be a Bishop of Carthage, as men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) color were, in other ages.
<p/>Then, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) was in a beautiful place, a consideration to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) sensitive race was never indifferent; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) did enjoy with a quiet joy the birds, the flowers, the fountains, the perfume, and light and beauty of the court, the silken hangings, and pictures, and lustres, and statuettes, and gilding, that made the parlors within a kind of Aladdin's palace to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>) was kept well dressed, for St. Clare was fastidiously particular on this point. If ever Africa shall show an elevated and cultivated race,--and come it must,
<p/>some time, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) turn to figure in the great drama of human improvement.--life will awake there with a gorgeousness and splendor of which our cold western tribes faintly have conceived.
<p/>In that far-off mystic land of gold, and gems, and spices, and waving palms, and wondrous flowers, and miraculous fertility, will awake new forms of art, new styles of splendor; and the negro race, no longer despised and trodden down, will, perhaps, show forth some of the latest and most magnificent revelations of human life.
<p/>Certainly they will, in their gentleness, their lowly docility of heart, their aptitude to repose on a superior mind and rest on a higher power, their childlike simplicity of affection, and facility of forgiveness.
<p/>In all these they will exhibit the highest form of the peculiarly Christian life , and, perhaps, as God chasteneth whom he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loveth, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hath chosen poor Africa in the furnace of affliction, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) the highest and noblest in that kingdom which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will set up, when every other kingdom has been tried, and failed; for the first shall be last, and the last first.
<p/>Was this what Marie St. Clare was thinking of, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) stood, gorgeously dressed, on the verandah, on Sunday morning, clasping a diamond bracelet on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) slender wrist?
<p/>Or, if it wasn't that, it was something else; for Marie patronized good things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was going now, in full force,--diamonds, silk, and lace, and jewels, and all,--to a fashionable church, to be very religious.
<p/>Most likely it was. Marie always made a point to be very pious on Sundays. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) stood, so slender, so elegant, so airy and undulating in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) motions,
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lace scarf enveloping her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) like a mist. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) looked a graceful creature, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) felt very good and very elegant indeed.
<p/>It was not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had not as handsome a silk dress and shawl, and as fine a pocket-handkerchief; but stiffness and squareness, and bolt-uprightness, enveloped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) with as indefinite yet appreciable a presence as did grace her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) elegant neighbor; not the grace of God, however,--that is quite another thing!
<p/>Miss Ophelia stood at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) side, a perfect contrast. '' Where's Eva?'' said Marie. '' The child stopped on the stairs, to say something to Mammy.
<p/>'' And what was Eva saying to Mammy on the stairs? Listen, reader, and you will hear, though Marie does not. ''
<p/>Dear Mammy, I know your head is aching dreadfully. '' <div class="bookquote">``Lord bless you, Miss Eva! my head allers aches lately. You don't need to worry.
<p/>Well, I'm glad you're going out; and here,'' (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>--and the little girl threw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``Mammy, you shall take my vinaigrette.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do hear the darlin talk!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Mammy, as Eva thrust it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) bosom, and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), ran down stairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mother.
<p/>'' What were you stopping for?'' <div class="bookquote">``I was just stopping to give Mammy my vinaigrette, to take to church with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Eva''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie, stamping impatiently,--<div class="bookquote">``your gold vinaigrette to Mammy! When will you learn what's proper ? Go right and take it back this moment!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Eva looked downcast and aggrieved, and turned slowly. '' I say, Marie, let the child alone; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) shall do as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) pleases,'' said St. Clare.
<p/>'' St. Clare, how will she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ever get along in the world?'' said Marie. '' The Lord knows,'' said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'ll get along in heaven better than you or I.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, papa, don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said Eva, softly touching his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) elbow; <div class="bookquote">``it troubles mother.

<p/>If I did go at all, I would go where Mammy goes; there's something to keep a fellow awake there, at least.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, papa; but I'd rather go to church.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Isn't it dreadful tiresome?''

<p/>St. Clare stood on the steps and kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), as the carriage drove away; large tears were in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>You see, Evangeline,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Evangeline</b></font>) mother, ``it's always right and proper to be kind to servants, but it isn't proper to treat them just as we would our relations, or people in our own class of life.

<p/>'' What can I do to make this child understand me? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said. '' Nothing,'' said Miss Ophelia, significantly. *

<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must have been very improving,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare. '' The subject must have been an extensive one.'' '' Well, I mean all my views about society, and such things,'' said Marie.
<p/>The text was, `He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hath made everything beautiful in its season;' and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) showed how all the orders and distinctions in society came from God; and that it was so appropriate, you know, and beautiful, that some should be high and some low, and that some were born to rule and some to serve, and all that, you know; and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) applied it so well to all this ridiculous fuss that is made about slavery, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) proved distinctly that the Bible was on our side, and supported all our institutions so convincingly.
<p/>I can learn what does me as much good as that from the Picayune, any time, and smoke a cigar besides; which I can't do, you know, in a church.
<p/>'' I only wish you'd heard him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``O, I didn't need it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare.

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/>If I was to say anything on this slavery matter, I would say out, fair and square, `We're in for it; we've got 'em, and mean to keep 'em,--it's for our convenience and our interest;' for that's the long and short of it,--that's just the whole of what all this sanctified stuff amounts to, after all; and I think that it will be intelligible to everybody, everywhere.

(<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie.
<p/>This religious talk on such matters,--why don't they carry it a little further, and show the beauty, in its season, of a fellow's taking a glass too much, and sitting a little too late over his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cards, and various providential arrangements of that sort, which are pretty frequent among us
<p/>'' I think it's shocking to hear you talk. '' <div class="bookquote">``Shocking! it's the truth. young men;--we'd like to hear that those are right and godly, too.

(<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>'' I'm not going to have any of your horrid New England directness, cousin,'' said St. Clare, gayly.
<p/>If I answer that question, I know you'll be at me with half a dozen others, each one harder than the last; and I'm not a going to define my position.
<p/>I am one of the sort that lives by throwing stones at other people's glass houses, but I never mean to put up one for them to stone.''

<p/>Is that which can bend and turn, and descend and ascend, to fit every crooked phase of selfish, worldly society, religion?
<p/>Is that religion which is less scrupulous, less generous, less just, less considerate for man, than even my own ungodly, worldly, blinded nature?
<p/>No! When I look for a religion, I must look for something above me, and not something beneath.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you don't believe that the Bible justifies slavery,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>'' The Bible was my mother's book,'' said St. Clare. '' By it she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lived and died, and I would be very sorry to think it did.
<p/>I'd as soon desire to have it proved that my mother could drink brandy, chew tobacco, and swear, by way of satisfying me that I did right in doing the same.
<p/>It wouldn't make me at all more satisfied with these things in myself, and it would take from me the comfort of respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and it really is a comfort, in this world, to have anything one can respect.
<p/>In short, you see,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), suddenly resuming his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gay tone, <div class="bookquote">``all I want is that different things be kept in different boxes.
<p/>The whole frame-work of society, both in Europe and America, is made up of various things which will not stand the scrutiny of any very ideal standard of morality.
<p/>It's pretty generally understood that men don't aspire after the absolute right, but only to do about as well as the rest of the world.
<p/>Now, when any one speaks up, like a man, and says slavery is necessary to us, we can't get along without it, we should be beggared if we give it up, and, of course, we mean to hold on to it,--this
<p/>is strong, clear, well-defined language; it has the respectability of truth to it; and, if we may judge by their practice, the majority of the world will bear us out in it.
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begins to put on a long face, and snuffle, and quote Scripture, I incline to think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) isn't much better than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be.

<p/>I wanted the horses out early, this morning, and I stole up to Tom's cubiculum there, over the stables, and there I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) holding a meeting by himself; and, in fact, I haven't heard anything quite so savory as Tom's prayer, this some time.

<p/>'' Well, we shall see,--shan't we, Eva?'' CHAPTER XVII The Freeman's Defence There was a gentle bustle at the Quaker house, as the afternoon drew to a close.
<p/>Rachel Halliday moved quietly to and fro, collecting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) household stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest compass, for the wanderers who were to go forth that night.
<p/>The afternoon shadows stretched eastward, and the round red sun stood thoughtfully on the horizon, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Freeman</b></font>) beams shone yellow and calm into the little bed-room where George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife were sitting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) child on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) knee, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife's hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). Both looked thoughtful and serious and traces of tears were on their cheeks.
<p/>'' Yes, Eliza,'' said George, <div class="bookquote">``I know all you say is true. You are a good child,--a great deal better than I am; and I will try to do as you say.
<p/>I'll try to act worthy of a free man. I'll try to feel like a Christian. God Almighty knows that I've meant to do
<p/>everything has been against me; and now I'll forget all the past, and put away every hard and bitter feeling, and read my Bible, and learn to be a good man.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>I can do dress-making very well; and I understand fine washing and ironing; and between us we can find something to live on.''
<p/>well,--tried hard to do well,--when '' And when we get to Canada,'' said Eliza, ``I can help you. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Eliza, so long as we have each other and our boy.
<p/>Eliza, if these people only knew what a blessing it is for a man to feel that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and child belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) !
<p/>I've often wondered to see men that could call their wives and children their own fretting and worrying about anything else.
<p/>O! Why, I feel rich and strong, though we have nothing but our bare hands. I feel as if I could scarcely ask God for any more.
<p/>Yes, though I've worked hard every day, till I am twenty-five years old, and have not a cent of money, nor a roof to cover me, nor a spot of land to call my own, yet, if they will only let me alone now, I will be satisfied,--thankful; I will work, and send back the money for you and my boy.
<p/>As to my old master, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) has been paid five times over for all he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ever spent for me. I don't owe him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) anything.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But yet we are not quite out of danger,'' said Eliza; <div class="bookquote">``we are not yet in Canada.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``but it seems as if I smelt the free air, and it makes me strong.
<p/>At this moment, voices were heard in the outer apartment, in earnest conversation, and very soon a rap was heard on the door.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>Eliza started and opened it. Simeon Halliday was there, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) a Quaker brother, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) introduced as Phineas Fletcher.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) had not the placid, quiet, unworldly air of Simeon Halliday; on the contrary, a particularly wide-awake and au fait appearance, like a man who rather prides himself on knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is about, and keeping a bright lookout ahead; peculiarities which sorted rather oddly with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broad brim and formal phraseology.
<p/>Our friend Phineas hath discovered something of importance to the interests of thee and thy party, George,'' said Simeon; <div class="bookquote">``it were well for thee to hear it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said Phineas, <div class="bookquote">``and it shows the use of a man's always sleeping with one ear open, in certain places, as I've always said.
<p/>Phineas was tall and lathy, red-haired, with an expression of great acuteness and shrewdness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) face. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>Last night I stopped at a little lone tavern, back on the road.
<p/>Well, I was tired with hard driving; and, after my supper I stretched myself down on a pile of bags in the corner, and pulled a buffalo over me, to wait till my bed was ready; and what does I do, but get fast asleep.
<p/>Thee remembers the place, Simeon, where we sold some apples, last year, to that fat woman, with the great ear-rings. ''
<p/>No; I slept, ears and all, for an hour or two, for I was pretty well tired; but when I came to myself a little, I found that there were some men in the room, sitting round a table, drinking and talking; and I thought, before I made much muster, I'd just see what they were up to, especially as I heard them say something about the Quakers. '
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With one ear open, Phineas?''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon, quietly. '' So,' says one, `they are up in the Quaker settlement, no doubt,' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>).
<p/>Then I listened with both ears, and I found that they were talking about this very party. So I lay and heard them lay off all their plans.
<p/>This young man, they said, was to be sent back to Kentucky, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master, who was going to make an example of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), to keep all niggers from running away; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife two of them were going to run down to New Orleans to sell, on their own account, and they calculated to get sixteen or eighteen hundred dollars for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and the child, they said, was going to a trader, who had bought him (<font color='blue'><b>trader</b></font>); and then there was the boy, Jim, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mother
<p/>They said that there were two constables, in a town a little piece ahead, who would go in with 'em to get 'em taken up, and the young woman was to be taken before a judge; and one of the fellows, who is small and smooth-spoken, was to swear to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) property, and get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) delivered over to him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) to take south.
<p/>They've got a right notion of the track we are going tonight; and they'll be down after us, six or eight strong.
<p/>, they were to go back to their masters in Kentucky. So now, what's to be done? '' The group that stood in various attitudes, after this communication, were worthy of a painter.
<p/>Rachel Halliday, who had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) hands out of a batch of biscuit, to hear the news, stood with them upraised and floury, and with a face of the deepest concern.
<p/>George stood with clenched hands and glowing eyes, and looking as any other man might look, whose wife was to be sold at auction, and son sent to a trader, all under the shelter of a Christian nation's laws.
<p/>Simeon looked profoundly thoughtful; Eliza had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) arms around her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband, and was looking up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>). '' What shall we do, George?'' said Eliza faintly.
<p/>'' I know what I shall do,'' said George, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stepped into the little room, and began examining pistols. ''
<p/>Ay, ay,'' said Phineas, nodding his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) head to Simeon; <div class="bookquote">``thou seest, Simeon, how it will work.''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon, sighing; <div class="bookquote">``I pray it come not to that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't want to involve any one with or for me,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George. '' If you will lend me your vehicle and direct me, I will drive alone to the next stand.
<p/>Jim is a giant in strength, and brave as death and despair, and so am I. '' '' Ah, well, friend,'' said Phineas, <div class="bookquote">``but thee'll need a driver, for all that.
<p/>Thee's quite welcome to do all the fighting, thee knows; but I know a thing or two about the road, that thee doesn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Involve,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said Phineas, with a curious and keen expression of face, <div class="bookquote">``When thee does involve me, please to let me know.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>But I don't want to involve you,'' said George. '' <div class="bookquote">``Phineas is a wise and skilful man,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon. ''
<p/>Thee does well, George, to abide by his (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) judgment; and,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) added, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) hand kindly on George's shoulder, and pointing to the pistols, <div class="bookquote">``be not over hasty with these,--young blood is hot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>All I ask of this country is to be let alone, and I will go out peaceably; but,''--he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) paused, and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) brow darkened and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) face worked,--``I've had a sister sold in that New Orleans market.
<p/>I know what they are sold for; and am I going to stand by and see them take my wife and sell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), when God has given me a pair of strong arms to defend her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will attack no man,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George. '' No; God help me! I'll fight to the last breath, before they shall take my wife and son.
<p/>Can you blame me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Mortal man cannot blame thee, George. Flesh and blood could not do otherwise,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon. '' Woe unto the world because of offences, but woe unto them through whom the offence cometh.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Would not even you, sir, do the same, in my place?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I pray that I be not tried,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon; ``the flesh is weak.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think my flesh would be pretty tolerable strong, in such a case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said Phineas, stretching out a pair of arms like the sails of a windmill.
<p/>I an't sure, friend George, that I shouldn't hold a fellow for thee, if thee had any accounts to settle with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).''
<p/>If man should ever resist evil,'' said Simeon, <div class="bookquote">``then George should feel free to do it now: but the leaders of our people taught a more excellent way; for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God; but it goes sorely against the corrupt will of man, and none can receive it save they to whom it is given.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>'' It's quite plain thee wasn't born a Friend,'' said Simeon, smiling. '' The old nature hath its way in thee pretty strong as yet.
<p/>To tell the truth, Phineas had been a hearty, two-fisted backwoodsman, a vigorous hunter, and a dead shot at a buck; but, having wooed a pretty Quakeress, had been moved by the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) charms to join the society in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) neighborhood; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) was an honest, sober, and efficient member, and nothing particular could be alleged against him (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>), yet the more spiritual among them could not but discern an exceeding lack of savor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) developments.
<p/>Friend Phineas will ever have ways of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) own,'' said Rachel Halliday, smiling; ``but we all think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) heart is in the right place, after all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I got up at four o'clock, and came on with all speed, full two or three hours ahead of them, if they start at the time they planned.
<p/>It isn't safe to start till dark, at any rate; for there are some evil persons in the villages ahead, that might be disposed to meddle with us, if they saw our wagon, and that would delay us more than the waiting; but in two hours I think we may venture.
<p/>I will go over to Michael Cross, and engage him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) to come behind on his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) swift nag, and keep a bright lookout on the road, and warn us if any company of men come on.
<p/>Michael keeps a horse that can soon get ahead of most other horses; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) could shoot ahead and let us know, if there were any danger.
<p/>I am going out now to warn Jim and the old woman to be in readiness, and to see about the horse.
<p/>We have a pretty fair start, and stand a good chance to get to the stand before they can come up with us.
<p/>So, have good courage, friend George; this isn't the first ugly scrape that I've been in with thy people,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said Phineas, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) closed the door.
<p/>'' '' '' '' Well,'' said George, <div class="bookquote">``isn't it best that we hasten our flight?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>'' Phineas is pretty shrewd,'' said Simeon.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Simeon</b></font>) will do the best that can be done for thee, George.'' '' All I am sorry for,'' said George, <div class="bookquote">``is the risk to you.''

<p/>Eliza,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel/Rachel Halliday</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``people that have friends, and houses, and lands, and money, and all those things can't love as we do, who have nothing but each other.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>'' Till I knew you, Eliza, no creature had loved me, but my poor, heart-broken mother and sister. I saw poor Emily that morning the trader carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) off.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) came to the corner where I was lying asleep, and said, `Poor George, your last friend is going. What will become of you, poor boy?'
<p/>And I got up and threw my arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>), and cried and sobbed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) cried too; and those were the last kind words I got for ten long years; and my heart all withered up, and felt as dry as ashes, till I met you.
<p/>And your loving me,--why, it was almost like raising one from the dead! I've been a new man ever since! And now, Eliza, I'll give my last drop of blood, but they shall not take you from me.
<p/>Whoever gets you must walk over my dead body.'' <div class="bookquote">``O, Lord, have mercy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>said Eliza, sobbing. '' If he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will only let us get out of this country together, that is all we ask.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is God on their side?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, speaking less to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife than pouring out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own bitter thoughts. '' Does he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) see all they do?
<p/>Why does he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) let such things happen? And they tell us that the Bible is on their side; certainly all the power is.
<p/>They are rich, and healthy, and happy; they are members of churches, expecting to go to heaven; and they get along so easy in the world, and have it all their own way; and poor, honest, faithful Christians,--Christians as good or better than they,--are lying in the very dust under their feet.
<p/>They buy 'em and sell 'em, and make trade of their heart's blood, and groans and tears,--and God lets them.'' <div class="bookquote">``Friend George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon, from the kitchen, <div class="bookquote">``listen to this Psalm; it may do thee good.
<p/>George drew his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) seat near the door, and Eliza, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) tears, came forward also to listen, while Simeon read as follows:
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well-nigh slipped. For I was envious of the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of the wicked.
<p/>They are not in trouble like other men, neither are they plagued like other men. Therefore, pride compasseth them as a chain; violence covereth them as a garment.
<p/>Their eyes stand out with fatness; they have more than heart could wish. They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression; they speak loftily.
<p/>Therefore his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) people return, and the waters of a full cup are wrung out to them, and they say, How doth God know?
<p/>and is there knowledge in the Most High?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is not that the way thee feels, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is so indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George,--<div class="bookquote">``as well as I could have written it myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then, hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Simeon: <div class="bookquote">``When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me until I went unto the sanctuary of God.
<p/>Then understood I their end. Surely thou didst set them in slippery places, thou castedst them down to destruction. As a dream when one awaketh, so, oh Lord, when thou awakest, thou shalt despise their image.
<p/>Nevertheless I am continually with thee; thou hast holden me by my right hand. Thou shalt guide me by thy counsel, and afterwards receive me to glory.
<p/>It is good for me to draw near unto God. I have put my trust in the Lord God. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>*
<p/>The words of holy trust, breathed by the friendly old man, stole like sacred music over the harassed and chafed spirit of George; and after he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) ceased, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat with a gentle and subdued expression on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fine features.
<p/>* Ps. 73, <div class="bookquote">``The End of the Wicked contrasted with that of the Righteous.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>'' If this world were all, George,'' said Simeon, <div class="bookquote">``thee might, indeed, ask where is the Lord?
<p/>But it is often those who have least of all in this life whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) chooseth for the kingdom. Put thy trust in him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) and, no matter what befalls thee here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will make all right hereafter.
<p/>If these words had been spoken by some easy, self-indulgent exhorter, from whose mouth they might have come merely as pious and rhetorical flourish, proper to be used to people in distress, perhaps they might not have had much effect; but coming from one who daily and calmly risked fine and imprisonment for the cause of God and man, they had a weight that could not but be felt, and both the poor, desolate fugitives found calmness and strength breathing into them from it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Simeon/Simeon Halliday</b></font>)</div>And now Rachel took Eliza's hand kindly, and led the way to the supper-table. As they were sitting down, a light tap sounded at the door, and Ruth entered.
<p/>'' I just ran in,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``with these little stockings for the boy,--three pair, nice, warm woollen ones. It will be so cold, thee knows, in Canada.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) added, tripping round to Eliza's side of the table, and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruth</b></font>) warmly by the hand, and slipping a seed-cake into Harry's hand.
<p/>Does thee keep up good courage, Eliza? '' I brought a little parcel of these for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, tugging at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) pocket to get out the package.
<p/>'' Children, thee knows, will always be eating. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, thank you; you are too kind,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>said Eliza. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Ruth, sit down to supper,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel/Rachel Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Rachel.
<p/>I left John with the baby, and some biscuits in the oven; and I can't stay a moment, else John will burn up all the biscuits, and give the baby all the sugar in the bowl.
<p/>So, good-by, Eliza; good-by, George; the Lord grant thee a safe journey;'' and, with a few tripping steps, Ruth was out of the apartment.
<p/>A little while after supper, a large covered-wagon drew up before the door; the night was clear starlight; and Phineas jumped briskly down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) seat to arrange his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) passengers.
<p/>'' I couldn't, any way. That's the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) does,'' said the little Quakeress, laughing. '' George walked out of the door, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) child on one arm and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife on the other.
<p/>You get out, a moment,'' said Phineas to those inside, <div class="bookquote">``and let me fix the back of the wagon, there, for the women-folks and the boy.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) step was firm, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face settled and resolute. Rachel and Simeon came out after them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Here are the two buffaloes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel/Rachel Halliday</b></font>)</div>said Rachel.
<p/>Jim came out first, and carefully assisted out his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) old mother, who clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) arm, and looked anxiously about, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) expected the pursuer every moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Make the seats as comfortable as may be; it's hard riding all night. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Crow</b></font>)</div>'' Jim, are your pistols all in order?'' said George, in a low, firm voice.
<p/>'' Yes, indeed,'' said Jim. '' And you've no doubt what you shall do, if they come?'' <div class="bookquote">``I rather think I haven't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Crow</b></font>)</div>said Jim, throwing open his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) broad chest, and taking a deep breath.
<p/>During this brief colloquy, Eliza had been taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) kind friend, Rachel, and was handed into the carriage by Simeon, and, creeping into the back part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) boy, sat down among the buffalo-skins.
<p/>The old woman was next handed in and seated and George and Jim placed on a rough board seat front of them, and Phineas mounted in front.
<p/>'' Do you think I'll let them get mother again? '' '' Farewell, my friends,'' said Simeon, from without. '' God bless you!'' answered all from within.
<p/>And the wagon drove off, rattling and jolting over the frozen road. There was no opportunity for conversation, on account of the roughness of the way and the noise of the wheels.
<p/>The vehicle, therefore, rumbled on, through long, dark stretches of woodland,--over wide dreary plains,--up hills, and down valleys,--and on, on, on they jogged, hour after hour.
<p/>The poor, frightened old woman at last forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fears; and, even Eliza, as the night waned, found all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) anxieties insufficient to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) eyes from closing.
<p/>Phineas seemed, on the whole, the briskest of the company, and beguiled his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) long drive with whistling certain very unquaker-like songs, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) went on.
<p/>But about three o'clock George's ear caught the hasty and decided click of a horse's hoof coming behind them at some distance and jogged Phineas by the elbow.
<p/>That must be Michael,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I think I know the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) gallop;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) rose up and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) head anxiously back over the road.
<p/>The child soon fell asleep, and lay heavily in his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) mother's lap. Phineas pulled up his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) horses, and listened. '' A man riding in hot haste was now dimly descried at the top of a distant hill.
<p/>'' There he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, I do believe!'' said Phineas. George and Jim both sprang out of the wagon before they knew what they were doing.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) went down into a valley, where they could not see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); but they heard the sharp, hasty tramp, rising nearer and nearer; at last they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) emerge on the top of an eminence, within hail.
<p/>All stood intensely silent, with their faces turned towards the expected messenger. On he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) came. '' Yes, that's Michael!'' said Phineas; and, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``Halloa, there, Michael!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Phineas! is that thee?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes; what news--they coming?'' '' Right on behind, eight or ten of them, hot with brandy, swearing and foaming like so many wolves.
<p/>'' And, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) spoke, a breeze brought the faint sound of galloping horsemen towards them. '' In with you,--quick, boys, in! '' said Phineas.
<p/>And, with the word, both jumped in, and Phineas lashed the horses to a run, the horseman keeping close beside them.
<p/>The wagon rattled, jumped, almost flew, over the frozen ground; but plainer, and still plainer, came the noise of pursuing horsemen behind.
<p/>The women heard it, and, looking anxiously out, saw, far in the rear, on the brow of a distant hill, a party of men looming up against the red-streaked sky of early dawn.
<p/>'' If you must fight, wait till I get you a piece ahead. '' Another hill, and their pursuers had evidently caught sight of their wagon,
<p/>whose white cloth-covered top made it conspicuous at some distance, and a loud yell of brutal triumph came forward on the wind.
<p/>Eliza sickened, and strained her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) bosom; the old woman prayed and groaned, and George and Jim clenched their pistols with the grasp of despair.
<p/>The pursuers gained on them fast; the carriage made a sudden turn, and brought them near a ledge of a steep overhanging rock, that rose in an isolated ridge or clump in a large lot, which was, all around it, quite clear and smooth.
<p/>This isolated pile, or range of rocks, rose up black and heavy against the brightening sky, and seemed to promise shelter and concealment.
<p/>It was a place well known to Phineas, who had been familiar with the spot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) hunting days; and it was to gain this point he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) had been racing his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) horses.
<p/>'' Now for it! '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>), suddenly checking his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) horses, and springing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) seat to the ground. '' Out with you, in a twinkling, every one, and up into these rocks with me.
<p/>Michael, thee tie thy horse to the wagon, and drive ahead to Amariah's and get him (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) boys to come back and talk to these fellows.
<p/>There,'' said Phineas, catching up Harry, ``you, each of you, see to the women; and run, now if you ever did run!
<p/>Quicker than we can say it, the whole party were over the fence, making with all speed for the rocks, while Michael, throwing himself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) horse, and fastening the bridle to the wagon, began driving it rapidly away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come ahead,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said Phineas, as they reached the rocks, and saw in the mingled starlight and dawn, the traces of a rude but plainly marked foot-path leading up among them; <div class="bookquote">``this is one of our old hunting-dens.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>In a twinkling they were all out of the carriage. '' '' They needed no exhortation. Come up!'' Phineas went before, springing up the rocks like a goat, with the boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) arms.
<p/>The party of horsemen came up to the fence, and, with mingled shouts and oaths, were dismounting, to prepare to follow them.
<p/>A few moments' scrambling brought them to the top of the ledge; the path then passed between a narrow defile, where only one could walk at a time, till suddenly they came to a rift or chasm more than a yard in breadth, and beyond which lay a pile of rocks, separate from the rest of the ledge, standing full thirty feet high, with its sides steep and perpendicular as those of a castle.
<p/>Phineas easily leaped the chasm, and sat down the boy on a smooth, flat platform of crisp white moss, that covered the top of the rock.
<p/>Jim came second, bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) trembling old mother over his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) shoulder, and George and Eliza brought up the rear. '' Over with you!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) called; <div class="bookquote">``spring, now, once, for your lives!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), as one after another sprang across.
<p/>Several fragments of loose stone formed a kind of breast-work, which sheltered their position from the observation of those below. ''
<p/>Well, here we all are,'' said Phineas, peeping over the stone breast-work to watch the assailants, who were coming tumultuously up under the rocks.
<p/>Whoever comes here has to walk single file between those two rocks, in fair range of your pistols, boys, d'ye see?''
<p/>'' Let 'em get us, if they can. <div class="bookquote">``I do see,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George! <div class="bookquote">``and now, as this matter is ours, let us take all the risk, and do all the fighting.
<p/>Thee's quite welcome to do the fighting, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said Phineas, chewing some checkerberry-leaves as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) spoke; <div class="bookquote">``but I may have the fun of looking on, I suppose.
<p/>But see, these fellows are kinder debating down there, and looking up, like hens when they are going to fly up on to the roost.
<p/>Hadn't thee better give 'em a word of advice, before they come up, just to tell 'em handsomely they'll be shot if they do?
<p/>The party beneath, now more apparent in the light of the dawn, consisted of our old acquaintances, Tom Loker and Marks, with two constables, and a posse consisting of such rowdies at the last tavern as could be engaged by a little brandy to go and help the fun of trapping a set of niggers.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Well, Tom, yer coons are farly treed,'' said one. '' Yes, I see 'em go up right here,'' said Tom;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``and here's a path. I'm for going right up. They can't jump down in a hurry, and it won't take long to ferret 'em out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But, Tom, they might fire at us from behind the rocks,'' said Marks. '' That would be ugly, you know.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ugh! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with a sneer. '' Always for saving your skin, Marks! No danger! niggers are too plaguy scared!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know why I shouldn't save my skin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marks</b></font>)</div>said Marks. '' It's the best I've got; and niggers do fight like the devil, sometimes.
<p/>At this moment, George appeared on the top of a rock above them, and, speaking in a calm, clear voice, said, <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, who are you, down there, and what do you want?''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``We want a party of runaway niggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom Loker. '' One George Harris, and Eliza Harris, and their son, and Jim Selden, and an old woman.
<p/>We've got the officers, here, and a warrant to take 'em; and we're going to have 'em, too. D'ye hear? An't you George Harris
<p/>, that belongs to Mr. Harris, of Shelby county, Kentucky?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am George Harris. A Mr. Harris, of Kentucky, did call me his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) property.
<p/>But now I'm a free man, standing on God's free soil; and my wife and my child I claim as mine.
<p/>You can come up, if you like; but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man, and the next, and the next; and so on till the last.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jim/Jim Crow</b></font>)</div><p/>Jim and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) mother are here. We have arms to defend ourselves, and we mean to do it. <div class="bookquote">``O, come! come!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>said a short, puffy man, stepping forward, and blowing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so. '' Young man, this an't no kind of talk at all for you.
<p/>We've got the law on our side, and the power, and so forth; so you'd better give up peaceably, you see; for you'll certainly have to give up, at last.''
<p/>You see, we're officers of justice. <div class="bookquote">``I know very well that you've got the law on your side, and the power,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, bitterly.
<p/>You mean to take my wife to sell in New Orleans, and put my boy like a calf in a trader's pen, and send Jim's old mother to the brute that whipped and abused her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) couldn't abuse her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) son.
<p/>You want to send Jim and me back to be whipped and tortured, and ground down under the heels of them that you call masters; and your laws will bear you out in it,--more shame for you and them!
<p/>We don't own your laws; we don't own your country; we stand here as free, under God's sky, as you are; and, by the great God that made us, we'll fight for our liberty till we die.
<p/>George stood out in fair sight, on the top of the rock, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) declaration of independence; the glow of dawn gave a flush to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) swarthy cheek, and bitter indignation and despair gave fire to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dark eye; and, as if appealing from man to the justice of God, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand to heaven as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>If it had been only a Hungarian youth, now bravely defending in some mountain fastness the retreat of fugitives escaping from Austria into America, this would have been sublime heroism; but as it was a youth of African descent, defending the retreat of fugitives through America into Canada, of course we are too well instructed and patriotic to see any heroism in it; and if any of our readers do, they must do it on their own private responsibility.
<p/>When despairing Hungarian fugitives make their way, against all the search-warrants and authorities of their lawful government, to America, press and political cabinet ring with applause and welcome.
<p/>Be it as it may, it is certain that the attitude, eye, voice, manner, of the speaker for a moment struck the party below to silence.
<p/>'' But you haven't got us. '' When despairing African fugitives do the same thing,--it is--what is it? There is something in boldness and determination that for a time hushes even the rudest nature.
<p/>Marks was the only one who remained wholly untouched. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was deliberately cocking his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) pistol, and, in the momentary silence that followed George's speech, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) fired at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
<p/>Ye see ye get jist as much for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) dead as alive in Kentucky,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said coolly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pistol on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) coat-sleeve.
<p/>George sprang backward,--Eliza uttered a shriek,--the ball had passed close to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hair, had nearly grazed the cheek of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife, and struck in the tree above.
<p/>'' '' It's nothing, Eliza,'' said George, quickly. '' Thee'd better keep out of sight, with thy speechifying,'' said Phineas; <div class="bookquote">``they're mean scamps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Jim,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, <div class="bookquote">``look that your pistols are all right, and watch that pass with me. The first man that shows himself I fire at; you take the second, and so on.
<p/>It won't do, you know, to waste two shots on one.''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>'' But what if you don't hit?'' <div class="bookquote">``I shall hit,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, coolly.
<p/>'' Good! now, there's stuff in that fellow,'' muttered Phineas, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) teeth. The party below, after Marks had fired, stood, for a moment, rather undecided.
<p/>'' I think you must have hit some on 'em,'' said one of the men. '' I heard a squeal!'' ''
<p/>I'm going right up for one,'' said Tom. '' I never was afraid of niggers, and I an't going to be now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drew up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pistol, examined it, pointed it towards that point in the defile where the first man would appear.
<p/>One of the most courageous of the party followed Tom, and, the way being thus made, the whole party began pushing up the rock,--the hindermost pushing the front ones faster than they would have gone of themselves.
<p/>On they came, and in a moment the burly form of Tom appeared in sight, almost at the verge of the chasm.
<p/>George fired,--the shot entered his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) side,--but, though wounded, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would not retreat, but, with a yell like that of a mad bull, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was leaping right across the chasm into the party.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said Phineas, suddenly stepping to the front, and meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) with a push from his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) long arms, <div class="bookquote">``thee isn't wanted here.
<p/>Down he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) fell into the chasm, crackling down among trees, bushes, logs, loose stones, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) lay bruised and groaning thirty feet below.
<p/>The fall might have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>), had it not been broken and moderated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) clothes catching in the branches of a large tree; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) came down with some force, however,--more than was at all agreeable or convenient.
<p/>Lord help us, they are perfect devils!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Marks, heading the retreat down the rocks with much more of a will than he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had joined the ascent, while all the party came tumbling precipitately after him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>),--the fat constable, in particular, blowing and puffing in a very energetic manner.
<p/>I say, fellers,'' said Marks, <div class="bookquote">``you jist go round and pick up Tom, there, while I run and get on to my horse to go back for help,--that's you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Marks</b></font>)</div>and, without minding the hootings and jeers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) company, Marks was as good as his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) word, and was soon seen galloping away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was ever such a sneaking varmint?''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>said one of the men; <div class="bookquote">``to come on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) clear out and leave us this yer way!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>Who goes after? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, springing up the rocks. George heard the words distinctly. '' '' '' '' Well, we must pick up that feller,'' said another.
<p/>The men, led by the groans of Tom, scrambled and crackled through stumps, logs and bushes, to where that hero lay groaning and swearing with alternate vehemence.
<p/>'' Cuss me if I much care whether he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) is dead or alive. '' '' Ye keep it agoing pretty loud, Tom,'' said one.
<p/>'' Ye much hurt?'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't know. Get me up, can't ye? Blast that infernal Quaker! If it hadn't been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), I'd a pitched some on 'em down here, to see how they liked it.
<p/>With much labor and groaning, the fallen hero was assisted to rise; and, with one holding him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) up under each shoulder, they got him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) as far as the horses.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' If you could only get me a mile back to that ar tavern. Give me a handkerchief or something, to stuff into this place, and stop this infernal bleeding.
<p/>'' George looked over the rocks, and saw them trying to lift the burly form of Tom into the saddle. After two or three ineffectual attempts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reeled, and fell heavily to the ground.
<p/>'' O, I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) isn't killed!'' said Eliza, who, with all the party, stood watching the proceeding. '' Why not?'' said Phineas; <div class="bookquote">``serves him (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) right.
<p/>Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, who had been groaning and praying, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Methodist fashion, during all the encounter, <div class="bookquote">``it's an awful case for the poor crittur's soul.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Because after death comes the judgment,'' said Eliza. '' <div class="bookquote">``On my word, they're leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>), I do believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said Phineas.
<p/>It was true; for after some appearance of irresolution and consultation, the whole party got on their horses and rode away.
<p/>When they were quite out of sight, Phineas began to bestir himself. '' Well, we must go down and walk a piece,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) said.
<p/>I told Michael to go forward and bring help, and be along back here with the wagon; but we shall have to walk a piece along the road, I reckon, to meet them.
<p/>It's early in the day; there won't be much travel afoot yet a while; we an't much more than two miles from our stopping-place.
<p/>'' The Lord grant he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) be along soon! If the road hadn't been so rough last night, we could have outrun 'em entirely.
<p/>As the party neared the fence, they discovered in the distance, along the road, their own wagon coming back, accompanied by some men on horseback.
<p/>'' '' Well, now, there's Michael, and Stephen and Amariah,'' exclaimed Phineas, joyfully. '' Now we are made--as safe as if we'd got there.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, do stop, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>said Eliza, <div class="bookquote">``and do something for that poor man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s groaning dreadfully. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It would be no more than Christian,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George; <div class="bookquote">``let's take him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up and carry him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, let's have a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>);'' and Phineas, who in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) hunting and backwoods life had acquired some rude experience of surgery, kneeled down by the wounded man, and began a careful examination of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition.
<p/>'' And doctor him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up among the Quakers!'' said Phineas; <div class="bookquote">``pretty well, that! Well, I don't care if we do. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div><p/>Marks,'' said Tom, feebly, <div class="bookquote">``is that you, Marks?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>'' No; I reckon `tan't friend,'' said Phineas. '' Much Marks cares for thee, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) own skin's safe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>)'s off, long ago. '' <div class="bookquote">``I believe I'm done for,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom. '' The cussed sneaking dog, to leave me to die alone!
<p/>My poor old mother always told me 't would be so.'' '' La sakes! jist hear the poor crittur. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s got a mammy, now,'' said the old negress.
<p/>'' I can't help kinder pityin' on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Softly, softly; don't thee snap and snarl, friend,''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>said Phineas, as Tom winced and pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) hand away.
<p/>And Phineas busied himself with making some off-hand surgical arrangements with his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) own pocket-handkerchief, and such as could be mustered in the company.
<p/>'' Thee has no chance, unless I stop the bleeding. '' '' You pushed me down there,'' said Tom, faintly. ''
<p/>Well if I hadn't thee would have pushed us down, thee sees,'' said Phineas, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) stooped to apply his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) bandage.
<p/>'' There, there,--let me fix this bandage. We mean well to thee; we bear no malice. Thee shall be taken to a house where they'll nurse thee first rate, well as thy own mother could.''
<p/>In men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) class, vigor and resolution are entirely a physical matter, and ooze out with the flowing of the blood; and the gigantic fellow really looked piteous in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) helplessness.
<p/>The buffalo-skins, doubled in fours, were spread all along one side, and four men, with great difficulty, lifted the heavy form of Tom into it.
<p/>Tom groaned, and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes. The other party now came up. The seats were taken out of the wagon. Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was gotten in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fainted entirely.
<p/>The old negress, in the abundance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) compassion, sat down on the bottom, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lap.
<p/>Eliza, George and Jim, bestowed themselves, as well as they could, in the remaining space and the whole party set forward.
<p/>'' What do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)?'' said George, who sat by Phineas in front. '' Well it's only a pretty deep flesh-wound; but, then, tumbling and scratching down that place didn't help him (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) much.
<p/>It has bled pretty freely,--pretty much drained him (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>) out, courage and all,--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Phineas</b></font>)'ll get over it, and may be learn a thing or two by it.
<p/>'' '' I'm glad to hear you say so,'' said George. '' It would always be a heavy thought to me,
<p/>if I'd caused his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) death, even in a just cause. '' '' Yes,'' said Phineas, <div class="bookquote">``killing is an ugly operation, any way they'll fix it,--man or beast.
<p/>I've seen a buck that was shot down and a dying, look that way on a feller with his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) eye, that it reely most made a feller feel wicked for killing on him (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>); and human creatures is a more serious consideration yet, bein', as thy wife says, that the judgment comes to 'em after death.
<p/>So I don't know as our people's notions on these matters is too strict; and, considerin' how I was raised, I fell in with them pretty considerably.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Phineas/Phineas Fletcher</b></font>)</div>'' What shall you do with this poor fellow?'' said George. '' O, carry him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) along to Amariah's. There's old Grandmam Stephens there,--Dorcas, they call her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>),--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>)'s most an amazin' nurse.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) takes to nursing real natural, and an't never better suited than when she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) gets a sick body to tend. We may reckon on turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephens</b></font>) over to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) for a fortnight or so.
<p/>A ride of about an hour more brought the party to a neat farmhouse, where the weary travellers were received to an abundant breakfast.
<p/>Tom Loker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed than he (<font color='blue'><b>Loker</b></font>) had ever been in the habit of occupying.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Loker</b></font>) wound was carefully dressed and bandaged, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Loker</b></font>) lay languidly opening and shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>Loker</b></font>) eyes on the white window-curtains and gently-gliding figures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Loker</b></font>) sick room, like a weary child.
<p/>CHAPTER XVIII Miss Ophelia's Experiences and Opinions Our friend Tom, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own simple musings, often compared his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) more fortunate lot, in the bondage into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was cast, with that of Joseph in Egypt; and, in fact, as time went on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) developed more and more under the eye of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master, the strength of the parallel increased.
<p/>'' And here, for the present, we shall take our leave of one party. St. Clare was indolent and careless of money.
<p/>Hitherto the providing and marketing had been principally done by Adolph, who was, to the full, as careless and extravagant as his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) master; and, between them both, they had carried on the dispersing process with great alacrity.
<p/>Accustomed, for many years, to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) master's property as his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) own care, Tom saw, with an uneasiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could scarcely repress, the wasteful expenditure of the establishment; and, in the quiet, indirect way which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) class often acquire, would sometimes make his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own suggestions.
<p/>St. Clare at first employed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) occasionally; but, struck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) soundness of mind and good business capacity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) confided in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) more and more, till gradually all the marketing and providing for the family were intrusted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>No, no, Adolph,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) said, one day, as Adolph was deprecating the passing of power out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) hands; <div class="bookquote">``let Tom alone.
<p/>You only understand what you want; Tom understands cost and come to; and there may be some end to money, bye and bye if we don't let somebody do that.
<p/>Trusted to an unlimited extent by a careless master, who handed him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a bill without looking at it, and pocketed the change without counting it, Tom had every facility and temptation to dishonesty; and nothing but an impregnable simplicity of nature, strengthened by Christian faith, could have kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>'' But, to that nature, the very unbounded trust reposed in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was bond and seal for the most scrupulous accuracy.
<p/>Thoughtless and self-indulgent, and unrestrained by a master who found it easier to indulge than to regulate, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had fallen into an absolute confusion as to meum tuum with regard to himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) master, which sometimes troubled even St. Clare.
<p/>With Adolph the case had been different. His (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) own good sense taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) that such a training of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) servants was unjust and dangerous.
<p/>A sort of chronic remorse went with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) everywhere, although not strong enough to make any decided change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) course; and this very remorse reacted again into indulgence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) passed lightly over the most serious faults, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) told himself that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) part, his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) dependents had not fallen into them.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) never read the Bible; never went to church; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) jested and made free with any and every thing that came in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) wit; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) Sunday evenings at the opera or theatre; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) went to wine parties, and clubs, and suppers, oftener than was at all expedient,--were all things that Tom could see as plainly as anybody, and on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) based a conviction that <div class="bookquote">``Mas'r wasn't a Christian;'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--a conviction, however, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have been very slow to express to any one else, but on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) founded many prayers, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own simple fashion, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was by himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) little dormitory.
<p/>Not that Tom had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own way of speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind occasionally, with something of the tact often observable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) class; as, for example, the very day after the Sabbath we have described, St. Clare was invited out to a convivial party of choice spirits, and was helped home, between one and two o'clock at night, in a condition when the physical had decidedly attained the upper hand of the intellectual.
<p/>Tom and Adolph assisted to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) composed for the night, the latter in high spirits, evidently regarding the matter as a good joke, and laughing heartily at the rusticity of Tom's horror, who really was simple enough to lie awake most of the rest of the night, praying for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) young master.
<p/>Well, Tom, what are you waiting for?'' said St. Clare, the next day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) library, in dressing-gown and slippers.
<p/>Tom regarded his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gay, airy, handsome young master with an odd mixture of fealty, reverence, and fatherly solicitude. '' St. Clare had just been entrusting Tom with some money, and various commissions.
<p/>'' Isn't all right there, Tom? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, as Tom still stood waiting. '' I'm `fraid not, Mas`r,'' said Tom, with a grave face.
<p/>St. Clare laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paper, and set down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coffee-cup, and looked at Tom. '' Why Tom, what's the case?
<p/>You look as solemn as a coffin.'' <div class="bookquote">``I feel very bad, Mas`r. I allays have thought that Mas'r would be good to everybody.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, Tom, haven't I been? Come, now, what do you want? There's something you haven't got, I suppose, and this is the preface.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mas'r allays been good to me. I haven't nothing to complain of on that head. But there is one that Mas'r isn't good to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Tom, what's got into you? Speak out; what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Last night, between one and two, I thought so.
<p/>I studied upon the matter then. Mas'r isn't good to himself . ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Tom said this with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand on the door-knob.
<p/>St. Clare felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face flush crimson, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) laughed. '' O, that's all, is it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, gayly. <div class="bookquote">``All!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, turning suddenly round and falling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees.
<p/>'' O, my dear young Mas`r; I'm `fraid it will be loss of all--all --body and soul. The good Book says, `it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder!'
<p/>my dear Mas`r! '' Tom's voice choked, and the tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cheeks. '' You poor, silly fool!'' said St. Clare, with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get up, Tom. I'm not worth crying over. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>But Tom wouldn't rise, and looked imploring. '' Well, I won't go to any more of their cursed nonsense, Tom,'' said St. Clare; <div class="bookquote">``on my honor, I won't.
<p/>I don't know why I haven't stopped long ago. I've always despised it , and myself for it,--so now, Tom, wipe up your eyes, and go about your errands.
<p/>Come, come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``no blessings. I'm not so wonderfully good, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gently pushed Tom to the door.
<p/>'' There, I'll pledge my honor to you, Tom, you don't see me so again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said; and Tom went off, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, with great satisfaction.
<p/>'' I'll keep my faith with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), too,'' said St. Clare, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) closed the door. And St. Clare did so,--for gross sensualism, in any form, was not the peculiar temptation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nature.
<p/>But, all this time, who shall detail the tribulations manifold of our friend Miss Ophelia, who had begun the labors of a Southern housekeeper?
<p/>There is all the difference in the world in the servants of Southern establishments, according to the character and capacity of the mistresses who have brought them up.
<p/>Such are enabled, with apparent ease, and without severity, to subject to their will, and bring into harmonious and systematic order, the various members of their small estate,--to regulate their peculiarities, and so balance and compensate the deficiencies of one by the excess of another, as to produce a harmonious and orderly system.
<p/>Such a housekeeper was Mrs. Shelby, whom we have already described; and such our readers may remember to have met with.
<p/>South as well as north, there are women who have an extraordinary talent for command, and tact in educating. If they are not common at the South, it is because they are not common in the world.
<p/>They are to be found there as often as anywhere; and, when existing, find in that peculiar state of society a brilliant opportunity to exhibit their domestic talent.
<p/>Indolent and childish, unsystematic and improvident, it was not to be expected that servants trained under her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) care should not be so likewise; and she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had very justly described to Miss Ophelia the state of confusion she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would find in the family, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had not ascribed it to the proper cause.
<p/>The first morning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) regency, Miss Ophelia was up at four o'clock; and having attended to all the adjustments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own chamber, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had done ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) came there, to the great amazement of the chambermaid, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) prepared for a vigorous onslaught on the cupboards and closets of the establishment of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had the keys.
<p/>Such a housekeeper Marie St. Clare was not, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother before her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). The store-room, the linen-presses, the china-closet, the kitchen and cellar, that day, all went under an awful review.
<p/>Hidden things of darkness were brought to light to an extent that alarmed all the principalities and powers of kitchen and chamber, and caused many wonderings and murmurings about <div class="bookquote">``dese yer northern ladies''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from the domestic cabinet.
<p/>Old Dinah, the head cook, and principal of all rule and authority in the kitchen department, was filled with wrath at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) considered an invasion of privilege.
<p/>Dinah was a character in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own way, and it would be injustice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) memory not to give the reader a little idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was a native and essential cook, as much as Aunt Chloe,--cooking being an indigenous talent of the African race; but Chloe was a trained and methodical one, who moved in an orderly domestic harness, while Dinah was a self-taught genius, and, like geniuses in general, was positive, opinionated and erratic, to the last degree.
<p/>Like a certain class of modern philosophers, Dinah perfectly scorned logic and reason in every shape, and always took refuge in intuitive certainty; and here she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was perfectly impregnable.
<p/>No possible amount of talent, or authority, or explanation, could ever make her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) believe that any other way was better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own, or that the course she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had pursued in the smallest matter could be in the least modified.
<p/>This had been a conceded point with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) old mistress, Marie's mother; and <div class="bookquote">``Miss Marie,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie mother</b></font>)</div>as Dinah always called her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) young mistress, even after her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) marriage, found it easier to submit than contend; and so Dinah had ruled supreme.
<p/>This was the easier, in that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was perfect mistress of that diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of manner with the utmost inflexibility as to measure.
<p/>No feudal baron in Magna Charta times could have more thoroughly resented some incursion of the crown. Dinah was mistress of the whole art and mystery of excuse-making, in all its branches.
<p/>Indeed, it was an axiom with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) that the cook can do no wrong; and a cook in a Southern kitchen finds abundance of heads and shoulders on which to lay off every sin and frailty, so as to maintain her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own immaculateness entire.
<p/>If any part of the dinner was a failure, there were fifty indisputably good reasons for it; and it was the fault undeniably of fifty other people, whom Dinah berated with unsparing zeal.
<p/>But it was very seldom that there was any failure in Dinah's last results. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) mode of doing everything was peculiarly meandering and circuitous, and without any sort of calculation as to time
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) kitchen generally looked as if it had been arranged by a hurricane blowing through it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had about as many places for each cooking utensil as there were days in the year,--yet,
<p/>if one would have patience to wait her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own good time, up would come her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) dinner in perfect order, and in a style of preparation with which an epicure could find no fault.
<p/>Dinah, who required large intervals of reflection and repose, and was studious of ease in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) arrangements, was seated on the kitchen floor, smoking a short, stumpy pipe, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was much addicted, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) always kindled up, as a sort of censer, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) felt the need of an inspiration in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) arrangements.
<p/>and place,--though It was now the season of incipient preparation for dinner. It was Dinah's mode of invoking the domestic Muses.
<p/>Seated around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) were various members of that rising race with which a Southern household abounds, engaged in shelling peas, peeling potatoes, picking pin-feathers out of fowls, and other preparatory arrangements,--Dinah every once in a while interrupting her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) meditations to give a poke, or a rap on the head, to some of the young operators, with the pudding-stick that lay by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) side.
<p/>In fact, Dinah ruled over the woolly heads of the younger members with a rod of iron, and seemed to consider them born for no earthly purpose but to <div class="bookquote">``save her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) steps,''  (<font color='red'><b>the members</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) phrased it.
<p/>It was the spirit of the system under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had grown up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) carried it out to its full extent.
<p/>Dinah had heard, from various sources, what was going on, and resolved to stand on defensive and conservative ground,--mentally determined to oppose and ignore every new measure, without any actual observable contest.
<p/>The kitchen was a large brick-floored apartment, with a great old-fashioned fireplace stretching along one side of it,--an arrangement which St. Clare had vainly tried to persuade Dinah to exchange for the convenience of a modern cook-stove.
<p/>Miss Ophelia, after passing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) reformatory tour through all the other parts of the establishment, now entered the kitchen. Not she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).

<p/>When St. Clare had first returned from the north, impressed with the system and order of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) uncle's kitchen arrangements, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had largely provided his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own with an array of cupboards, drawers, and various apparatus, to induce systematic regulation, under the sanguine illusion that it would be of any possible assistance to Dinah in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) arrangements.
<p/>No Puseyite,* or conservative of any school, was ever more inflexibly attached to time-honored inconveniences than Dinah. * He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) might as well have provided them for a squirrel or a magpie.
<p/>The more drawers and closets there were, the more hiding-holes could Dinah make for the accommodation of old rags, hair-combs, old shoes, ribbons, cast-off artificial flowers, and other articles of vertu , wherein her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) soul delighted.
<p/>When Miss Ophelia entered the kitchen Dinah did not rise, but smoked on in sublime tranquillity, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) movements obliquely out of the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eye, but apparently intent only on the operations around her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>).
<p/>Miss Ophelia commenced opening a set of drawers. '' What is this drawer for, Dinah? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said. '' It's handy for most anything, Missis,'' said Dinah.
<p/>From the variety it contained, Miss Ophelia pulled out first a fine damask table-cloth stained with blood, having evidently been used to envelop some raw meat.
<p/>So it appeared to be. '' What's this, Dinah? You don't wrap up meat in your mistress' best table-cloths?'' <div class="bookquote">``O Lor, Missis, no; the towels was all a missin'--so
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Shif`less!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia to herself, proceeding to tumble over the drawer, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) found a nutmeg-grater and two or three nutmegs, a Methodist hymn-book, a couple of soiled Madras handkerchiefs, some yarn and knitting-work, a paper of tobacco and a pipe, a few crackers, one or two gilded china-saucers with some pomade in them, one or two thin old shoes, a piece of flannel carefully pinned up enclosing some small white onions, several damask table-napkins, some coarse crash towels, some twine and darning-needles, and several broken papers, from which sundry sweet herbs were sifting into the drawer.
<p/>I jest did it. I laid out to wash that a,--that's why I put it thar. '' Where do you keep your nutmegs, Dinah?'' said Miss Ophelia, with the air of one who prayed for patience.
<p/>'' Most anywhar, Missis; there's some in that cracked tea-cup, up there, and there's some over in that ar cupboard. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Here are some in the grater,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, holding them up. '' Laws, yes, I put 'em there this morning,--I likes to keep my things handy,'' said Dinah.
<p/>'' You, Jake! what are you stopping for! You'll cotch it! Be still, thar!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) added, with a dive of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) stick at the criminal.
<p/>'' What's this?'' said Miss Ophelia, holding up the saucer of pomade. '' Laws, it's my har grease ;--I put it thar to have it handy.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you use your mistress' best saucers for that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Law! it was cause I was driv, and in sich a hurry;--I was gwine to change it this very day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Here are two damask table-napkins. '' <div class="bookquote">``Them table-napkins I put thar, to get 'em washed out, some day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you have some place here on purpose for things to be washed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>r St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, Mas'r St. Clare got dat ar chest, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, for dat; but I likes to mix up biscuit and hev my things on it some days, and then it an't handy a liftin' up the lid.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you mix your biscuits on the pastry-table, there?''  (<font color='red'><b>sot thing another</b></font>)</div>``Law, Missis, it gets sot so full of dishes, and one thing and another, der an't
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wash my dishes!''  (<font color='red'><b>sot thing another</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, in a high key, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) wrath began to rise over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) habitual respect of manner; <div class="bookquote">``what does ladies know `bout work, I want to know?
<p/>When 'd Mas'r ever get his (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) dinner, if I vas to spend all my time a washin' and a puttin' up dishes?
<p/>no room, noway--''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>'' But you should wash your dishes, and clear them away.'' Miss Marie never telled me so, nohow.''
<p/>'' Well, here are these onions. '' <div class="bookquote">``Laws, yes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>said Dinah; <div class="bookquote">``thar is whar I put 'em, now. I couldn't `member.
<p/>Them 's particular onions I was a savin' for dis yer very stew. I'd forgot they was in dat ar old flannel.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>Miss Ophelia lifted out the sifting papers of sweet herbs. '' I wish Missis wouldn't touch dem ar. I likes to keep my things where I knows whar to go to 'em,'' said Dinah, rather decidedly.
<p/>'' But you don't want these holes in the papers. '' '' Them 's handy for siftin' on 't out,'' said Dinah.
<p/>'' But you see it spills all over the drawer.'' <div class="bookquote">``Laws, yes! if Missis will go a tumblin' things all up so, it will.
<p/>If Missis only will go up stars till my clarin' up time comes, I'll have everything right; but I can't do nothin' when ladies is round, a henderin'.
<p/>Missis has spilt lots dat ar way ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, coming uneasily to the drawers. '' You, Sam, don't you gib the baby dat ar sugar-bowl!
<p/>I'm going through the kitchen, and going to put everything in order, once , Dinah; and then I'll expect you to keep it so.
<p/>I'll crack ye over, if ye don't mind!'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Lor, now! Miss Phelia; dat ar an't no way for ladies to do.
<p/>I never did see ladies doin' no sich; my old Missis nor Miss Marie never did, and I don't see no kinder need on `t;''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>and Dinah stalked indignantly about, while Miss Ophelia piled and sorted dishes, emptied dozens of scattering bowls of sugar into one receptacle, sorted napkins, table-cloths, and towels, for washing; washing, wiping, and arranging with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own hands, and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly amazed Dinah.
<p/>if dat ar de way dem northern ladies do, dey an't ladies, nohow,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said to some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) satellites, when at a safe hearing distance.
<p/>I has things as straight as anybody, when my clarin' up times comes; but I don't want ladies round, a henderin', and getting my things all where I can't find 'em.
<p/>To do Dinah justice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had, at irregular periods, paroxyms of reformation and arrangement, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``clarin' up times,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would begin with great zeal, and turn every drawer and closet wrong side outward, on to the floor or tables, and make the ordinary confusion seven-fold more confounded.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would light her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) pipe, and leisurely go over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) arrangements, looking things over, and discoursing upon them; making all the young fry scour most vigorously on the tin things, and keeping up for several hours a most energetic state of confusion, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) would explain to the satisfaction of all inquirers, by the remark that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``clarin' up.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) couldn't hev things a gwine on so as they had been, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was gwine to make these yer young ones keep better order;''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>for Dinah herself, somehow, indulged the illusion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>), herself, was the soul of order, and it was only the young uns , and the everybody else in the house, that were the cause of anything that fell short of perfection in this respect.
<p/>When all the tins were scoured, and the tables scrubbed snowy white, and everything that could offend tucked out of sight in holes and corners, Dinah would dress herself up in a smart dress, clean apron, and high, brilliant Madras turban, and tell all marauding <div class="bookquote">``young uns''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>to keep out of the kitchen, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) was gwine to have things kept nice.
<p/>Indeed, these periodic seasons were often an inconvenience to the whole household; for Dinah would contract such an immoderate attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) scoured tin, as to insist upon it that it shouldn't be used again for any possible purpose,--at least, till the ardor of the <div class="bookquote">``clarin' up''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>period abated.
<p/>Miss Ophelia, in a few days, thoroughly reformed every department of the house to a systematic pattern; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) labors in all departments that depended on the cooperation of servants were like those of Sisyphus or the Danaides.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lor now! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' In despair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) one day appealed to St. Clare. '' There is no such thing as getting anything like a system in this family!''
<p/>'' To be sure, there isn't,'' said St. Clare. '' Such shiftless management, such waste, such confusion, I never saw!'' <div class="bookquote">``I dare say you didn't.''
 (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div><p/>My dear cousin, you may as well understand, once for all, that we masters are divided into two classes, oppressors and oppressed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not take it so coolly, if you were housekeeper.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' We who are good-natured and hate severity make up our minds to a good deal of inconvenience.
<p/>If we will keep a shambling, loose, untaught set in the community, for our convenience, why, we must take the consequence.
<p/>Some rare cases I have seen, of persons, who, by a peculiar tact, can produce order and system without severity; but I'm not one of them,--and
<p/>I will not have the poor devils thrashed and cut to pieces, and they know it,--and, of course, they know the staff is in their own hands.''
<p/>so I made up my mind, long ago, to let things go just as they do. '' But to have no time, no place, no order,--all going on in this shiftless way!''
<p/>What on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knows what to do with?
<p/>As to order and system, where there is nothing to be done but to lounge on the sofa and read, an hour sooner or later in breakfast or dinner isn't of much account.
<p/>'' My dear Vermont, you natives up by the North Pole set an extravagant value on time! Now, there's Dinah gets you a capital dinner,--soup, ragout, roast fowl, dessert, ice-creams
<p/>and all,--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) creates it all out of chaos and old night down there, in that kitchen. I think it really sublime, the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) manages.
<p/>But, Heaven bless us! if we are to go down there, and view all the smoking and squatting about, and hurryscurryation of the preparatory process, we should never eat more!
<p/>My good cousin, absolve yourself from that! It's more than a Catholic penance, and does no more good. You'll only lose your own temper, and utterly confound Dinah.
<p/>Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) go her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) own way.'' '' But, Augustine, you don't know how I found things.'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't I? Don't I know that the rolling-pin is under her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) bed, and the nutmeg-grater in her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) pocket with her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) tobacco,--that
<p/>there are sixty-five different sugar-bowls, one in every hole in the house,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) washes dishes with a dinner-napkin one day, and with a fragment of an old petticoat the next?
<p/>But the upshot is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) gets up glorious dinners, makes superb coffee; and you must judge her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) as warriors and statesmen are judged, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) success .''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But the waste,--the expense!'' <div class="bookquote">``O, well! Lock everything you can, and keep the key. Give out by driblets, and never inquire for odds and ends,--it isn't best.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' That troubles me, Augustine. I can't help feeling as if these servants were not strictly honest . Are you sure they can be relied on?''
<p/>Augustine laughed immoderately at the grave and anxious face with which Miss Ophelia propounded the question. '' O, cousin, that's too good,-- honest!
<p/>--as if that's a thing to be expected! Honest!--why , of course, they arn't. Why should they be? What upon earth is to make them so?''
<p/>As to Marie, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) has spirit enough, to be sure, to kill off a whole plantation, if I'd let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) manage; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) wouldn't get the cheatery out of them.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you instruct?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Instruct! O, fiddlestick! What instructing do you think I should do? I look like it! <div class="bookquote">``Are there no honest ones?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, now and then one, whom Nature makes so impracticably simple, truthful and faithful, that the worst possible influence can't destroy it.
<p/>But, you see, from the mother's breast the colored child feels and sees that there are none but underhand ways open to it.
<p/>'' It can get along no other way with its parents, its mistress, its young master and missie play-fellows. Cunning and deception become necessary, inevitable habits.
<p/>As to honesty, the slave is kept in that dependent, semi-childish state, that there is no making him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) realize the rights of property, or feel that his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master's goods are not his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) own, if he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) can get them.
<p/>It isn't fair to expect anything else of him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) ought not to be punished for it. For my part, I don't see how they can be honest.
<p/>Such a fellow as Tom, here, is,--is a moral miracle!'' '' And what becomes of their souls?'' said Miss Ophelia. ''
<p/>That isn't my affair, as I know of,'' said St. Clare; <div class="bookquote">``I am only dealing in facts of the present life.
<p/>The fact is, that the whole race are pretty generally understood to be turned over to the devil, for our benefit, in this world, however it may turn out in another!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>'' This is perfectly horrible!'' said Miss Ophelia; <div class="bookquote">``you ought to be ashamed of yourselves!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't know as I am.
<p/>Look at the high and the low, all the world over, and it's the same story,--the lower class used up, body, soul and spirit, for the good of the upper.
<p/>It is so in England; it is so everywhere; and yet all Christendom stands aghast, with virtuous indignation, because we do the thing in a little different shape from what they do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>We are in pretty good company, for all that,'' said St. Clare, ``as people in the broad road generally are. <div class="bookquote">``It isn't so in Vermont.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But there's the bell; so, Cousin, let us for a while lay aside our sectional prejudices, and come out to dinner.
<p/>As Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen in the latter part of the afternoon, some of the sable children called out, ``La, sakes!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, well, in New England, and in the free States, you have the better of us, I grant. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Prue</b></font>)</div>thar's Prue a coming, grunting along like she (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) allers does.
<p/>'' A tall, bony colored woman now entered the kitchen, bearing on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head a basket of rusks and hot rolls.
<p/>'' Ho, Prue! you've come,'' said Dinah. Prue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance, and a sullen, grumbling voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) set down her (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) basket, squatted herself down, and resting her (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) elbows on her (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) knees said, <div class="bookquote">``O Lord!
<p/>I wish't I 's dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why do you wish you were dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' I'd be out o' my misery,'' said the woman, gruffly, without taking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes from the floor.
<p/>What need you getting drunk, then, and cutting up, Prue?'' said a spruce quadroon chambermaid, dangling, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) spoke, a pair of coral ear-drops.
<p/>'' The woman looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a sour surly glance. '' Maybe you'll come to it, one of these yer days.
<p/>I'd be glad to see you, I would; then you'll be glad of a drop, like me, to forget your misery.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Prue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, <div class="bookquote">``let's look at your rusks. Here's Missis will pay for them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>Miss Ophelia took out a couple of dozen.
<p/>'' Thar's some tickets in that ar old cracked jug on the top shelf,'' said Dinah. '' You, Jake, climb up and get it down.''
<p/>'' Tickets,--what are they for?'' said Miss Ophelia. '' We buy tickets of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) Mas`r, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) gives us bread for 'em.''
<p/>And they counts my money and tickets, when I gets home, to see if I 's got the change; and if I han't, they half kills me.''
<p/>'' '' And serves you right,'' said Jane, the pert chambermaid, <div class="bookquote">``if you will take their money to get drunk on.
<p/>That's what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does, Missis.''  (<font color='red'><b>the chambermaid</b></font>)</div>'' And that's what I will do,--I can't live no other ways,--drink and forget my misery.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are very wicked and very foolish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``to steal your master's money to make yourself a brute with.
<p/>I wish I 's dead, I do,--I wish I 's dead, and out of my misery!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>and slowly and stiffly the old creature rose, and got her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) basket on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) head again; but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) went out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) looked at the quadroon girl, who still stood playing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) ear-drops.
<p/>Ye think ye're mighty fine with them ar, a frolickin' and a tossin' your head, and a lookin' down on everybody.
<p/>'' '' '' It's mighty likely, Missis; but I will do it,--yes, I will. O Lord! '' Well, never mind,--you may live to be a poor, old, cut-up crittur, like me.
<p/>Hope to the Lord ye will, I do; then see if ye won't drink,--drink,--drink,--yerself into torment; and sarve ye right, too--ugh!
<p/>'' and, with a malignant howl, the woman left the room. '' Disgusting old beast!'' said Adolph, who was getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) master's shaving-water.
<p/>'' If I was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) master, I'd cut her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is.'' '' Ye couldn't do that ar, no ways,'' said Dinah.
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) back's a far sight now,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) can't never get a dress together over it. '' <div class="bookquote">``I think such low creatures ought not to be allowed to go round to genteel families,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Jane</b></font>)</div>said Miss Jane.
<p/>It must be observed that, among other appropriations from his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) master's stock, Adolph was in the habit of adopting his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) name and address; and that the style under which he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) moved, among the colored circles of New Orleans, was that of Mr. St. Clare .
<p/>'' What do you think, Mr. St. Clare? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said, coquettishly tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head at Adolph. '' I'm certainly of your opinion, Miss Benoir,'' said Adolph.
<p/>Benoir was the name of Marie St. Clare's family, and Jane was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) servants. '' Pray, Miss Benoir, may I be allowed to ask if those drops are for the ball, tomorrow night?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder, now, Mr. St. Clare, what the impudence of you men will come to!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pretty head 'til the ear-drops twinkled again.
<p/>They are certainly bewitching!'' '' I shan't dance with you for a whole evening, if you go to asking me any more questions.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, you couldn't be so cruel, now! I was just dying to know whether you would appear in your pink tarletane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>said Adolph.
<p/>'' What is it?'' said Rosa, a bright, piquant little quadroon who came skipping down stairs at this moment. '' Why, Mr. St. Clare's so impudent!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'s always a saucy creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa/Miss Rosa</b></font>)</div>said Rosa, poising herself on one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) little feet, and looking maliciously at Adolph.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On my honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>said Adolph, <div class="bookquote">``I'll leave it to Miss Rosa now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>)'s always getting me so angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``O! ladies, ladies, you will certainly break my heart, between you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>said Adolph. '' I shall be found dead in my bed, some morning, and you'll have it to answer for.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do hear the horrid creature talk!''  (<font color='red'><b>both ladies</b></font>)</div>said both ladies, laughing immoderately. '' Come,--clar out, you! I can't have you cluttering up the kitchen,'' said Dinah; <div class="bookquote">``in my way, foolin' round here.

<p/>'' And it will be wool, after all,'' said Rosa, maliciously shaking down her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) long, silky curls. '' Well, in the Lord's sight, an't wool as good as har, any time?'' said Dinah.
<p/>'' I'd like to have Missis say which is worth the most,--a couple such as you, or one like me. Get out wid
<p/>St. Clare's voice was heard at the head of the stairs, asking Adolph if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) meant to stay all night with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) shaving-water; and Miss Ophelia, coming out of the dining-room, said, <div class="bookquote">``Jane and Rosa, what are you wasting your time for, here?
<p/>ye, ye trumpery,--I won't have ye round!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>Here the conversation was interrupted in a two-fold manner. Go in and attend to your muslins.
<p/>Our friend Tom, who had been in the kitchen during the conversation with the old rusk-woman, had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) out into the street.
<p/>At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) set her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) basket down on a doorstep, and began arranging the old, faded shawl which covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) go on, giving every once in a while a suppressed groan. '' I'll carry your basket a piece,'' said Tom, compassionately.
<p/>'' Why should ye?'' said the woman. '' I don't want no help. '' <div class="bookquote">``You seem to be sick, or in trouble, or somethin',''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom.
<p/>'' I an't sick,'' said the woman, shortly. '' I wish,'' said Tom, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) earnestly,--<div class="bookquote">``I wish I could persuade you to leave off drinking.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) knowed I could feed it on what other folks eat; and the child kinder pined, and cried, and cried, and cried, day and night, and got all gone to skin and bones, and Missis got sot agin it

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) made me sleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) room; and I had to put it away off in a little kind o' garret, and thar it cried itself to death, one night.

<p/>S'pose they'd have me thar? I'd rather go to torment, and get away from Mas'r and Missis. Tom turned, and walked sorrowfully back to the house.
<p/>In the court he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) met little Eva,--a crown of tuberoses on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) head, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes radiant with delight. '' O, Tom! here you are.
<p/>Papa says you may get out the ponies, and take me in my little new carriage,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) hand.
<p/>I'm glad I've found you. '' But what's the matter Tom?--you look sober.'' '' I feel bad, Miss Eva,'' said Tom, sorrowfully.
<p/>'' But I'll get the horses for you.'' '' But do tell me, Tom, what is the matter. I saw you talking to cross old Prue.
<p/>'' Tom, in simple, earnest phrase, told Eva the woman's history. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) did not exclaim or wonder, or weep, as other children do.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) cheeks grew pale, and a deep, earnest shadow passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) laid both hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) bosom, and sighed heavily.

<p/>'' Why not, Miss Eva?'' '' These things sink into my heart, Tom,'' said Eva,--<div class="bookquote">``they sink into my heart,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) repeated, earnestly.
<p/>A few days after, another woman came, in old Prue's place, to bring the rusks; Miss Ophelia was in the kitchen.
<p/>'' I don't want to go;'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) turned from Tom, and went into the house. <div class="bookquote">``Lor! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>said Dinah, <div class="bookquote">``what's got Prue?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Prue isn't coming any more,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, mysteriously. '' Why not?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>)'s down cellar,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, glancing at Miss Ophelia. After Miss Ophelia had taken the rusks, Dinah followed the woman to the door.
<p/>'' What has got Prue, any how? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) said. The woman seemed desirous, yet reluctant, to speak, and answered, in low, mysterious tone.
<p/>'' Well, you mustn't tell nobody, Prue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) got drunk agin,--and they had her (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) down cellar,--and thar they left her (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) all
<p/>Dinah held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hands, and, turning, saw close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) side the spirit-like form of Evangeline, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) large, mystic eyes dilated with horror, and every drop of blood driven from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) lips and cheeks.

<p/>Miss Eva's gwine to faint away! What go us all, to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) har such talk? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) pa'll be rail mad.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shan't faint, Dinah,''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child, firmly; <div class="bookquote">``and why shouldn't I hear it? It an't so much for me to hear it, as for poor Prue to suffer it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Lor sakes ! it isn't for sweet, delicate young ladies, like you,--these yer stories isn't; it's enough to kill 'em!''
<p/>Dinah gave a very garrulous version of it, to which Tom added the particulars which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had drawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) that morning.
<p/>Eva sighed again, and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step. Miss Ophelia anxiously inquired the woman's story. ''
<p/>An abominable business,--perfectly horrible! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) exclaimed, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) entered the room where St. Clare lay reading his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paper. '' Pray, what iniquity has turned up now?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>why, those folks have whipped Prue to death!'' said Miss Ophelia, going on, with great strength of detail, into the story, and enlarging on its most shocking particulars.
<p/>'' What now? '' I thought it would come to that, some time,'' said St. Clare, going on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paper.
<p/>'' Thought so!--an't you going to do anything about it?'' said Miss Ophelia. '' Haven't you got any selectmen , or anybody, to interfere and look after such matters?''
<p/>'' It's commonly supposed that the property interest is a sufficient guard in these cases. If people choose to ruin their own possessions, I don't know what's to be done.
<p/>It seems the poor creature was a thief and a drunkard; and so there won't be much hope to get up sympathy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).''
<p/>'' It is perfectly outrageous,--it is horrid, Augustine! It will certainly bring down vengeance upon you.'' '' My dear cousin, I didn't do it, and I can't help it; I would, if I could.
<p/>If low-minded, brutal people will act like themselves, what am I to do? they have absolute control; they are irresponsible despots.
<p/>There would be no use in interfering; there is no law that amounts to anything practically, for such a case. The best we can do is to shut our eyes and ears, and let it alone.
<p/>It's the only resource left us.'' <div class="bookquote">``How can you shut your eyes and ears? How can you let such things alone?''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>Here is a whole class,--debased, uneducated, indolent, provoking,--put, without any sort of terms or conditions, entirely into the hands of such people as the majority in our world are; people who have neither consideration nor self-control, who haven't even an enlightened regard to their own interest,--for
<p/>Of course, in a community so organized, what can a man of honorable and humane feelings do, but shut his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can, and harden his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart?
<p/>'' My dear child, what do you expect? that's the case with the largest half of mankind. I can't buy every poor wretch I see.
<p/>I can't turn knight-errant, and undertake to redress every individual case of wrong in such a city as this. The most I can do is to try and keep out of the way of it.
<p/>St. Clare's fine countenance was for a moment overcast; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Come, cousin, don't stand there looking like one of the Fates; you've only seen a peep through the curtain,--a specimen of what is going on, the world over, in some shape or other.

<p/>T is like looking too close into the details of Dinah's kitchen;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and St. Clare lay back on the sofa, and busied himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) paper.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) knit and knit, but while she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mused the fire burned; at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) broke out--<div class="bookquote">``I tell you, Augustine, I can't get over things

<p/><div class="bookquote">``What now?''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, looking up. '' At it again, hey?'' <div class="bookquote">``I say it's perfectly abominable for you to defend such a system!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, with increasing warmth.
<p/>'' I defend it, my dear lady? Who ever said I did defend it?'' said St. Clare. '' Of course, you defend it,--you all do,--all you Southerners.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you such a sweet innocent as to suppose nobody in this world ever does what they don't think is right?
<p/>What do you have slaves for, if you don't?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Don't you, or didn't you ever, do anything that you did not think quite right?''
<p/>'' If I do, I repent of it, I hope,'' said Miss Ophelia, rattling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) needles with energy. '' So do I,'' said St. Clare, peeling his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) orange;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I'm repenting of it all the time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' What do you keep on doing it for?'' <div class="bookquote">``Didn't you ever keep on doing wrong, after you'd repented, my good cousin?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, only when I've been very much tempted,'' said Miss Ophelia. '' Well, I'm very much tempted,'' said St. Clare;
<p/>Well, I have been resolving I won't, off and on, these ten years,'' said St. Clare; ``but I haven't, some how, got clear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``that's just my difficulty.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I always resolve I won't and I try to break off.'' '' Have you got clear of all your sins, cousin?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cousin Augustine,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, seriously, and laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) knitting-work, ``I suppose I deserve that you should reprove my short-comings.
<p/>I know all you say is true enough; nobody else feels them more than I do; but it does seem to me, after all, there is some difference between me and you.
<p/>It seems to me I would cut off my right hand sooner than keep on, from day to day, doing what I thought was wrong.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, now, cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said Augustine, sitting down on the floor, and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) head back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) lap, <div class="bookquote">``don't take on so awfully serious!
<p/>But, then, my conduct is so inconsistent with my profession, I don't wonder you reprove me.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>You know what a good-for-nothing, saucy boy I always was.
<p/>I love to poke you up,--that's all,--just to see you get earnest. I do think you are desperately, distressingly good; it tires me to death to think of it.''
<p/>'' But this is a serious subject, my boy, Auguste,'' said Miss Ophelia, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forehead. '' Dismally so,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and I--well, I never want to talk seriously in hot weather.
<p/>What with mosquitos and all, a fellow can't get himself up to any very sublime moral flights; and I believe,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
<p/>St. Clare, suddenly rousing himself up, <div class="bookquote">``there's a theory, now! I understand now why northern nations are always more virtuous than southern ones,--I see into that whole subject.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, so I am, I suppose; but for once I will be serious, now; but you must hand me that basket of oranges;--you see, you'll have to `stay me with flagons and comfort me with apples,' if I'm going to make this effort.
<p/>When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for a fellow to hold two or three dozen of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) fellow-worms in captivity, a decent regard to the opinions of society requires--

<p/>The short of the matter is, cousin,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) handsome face suddenly settling into an earnest and serious expression, <div class="bookquote">``on this abstract question of slavery there can, as I think, be but one opinion.
<p/>Planters, who have money to make by it,--clergymen, who have planters to please,--politicians, who want to rule by it,--may warp and bend language and ethics to a degree that shall astonish the world at their ingenuity; they can press nature and the Bible, and nobody knows what else, into the service; but, after all, neither they nor the world believe in it one particle the more.
<p/>It comes from the devil, that's the short of it;--and, to my mind, it's a pretty respectable specimen of what he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) can do in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) own line.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Wait,--I'm coming on,--you'll hear. '' Miss Ophelia stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) knitting, and looked surprised, and St. Clare, apparently enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) astonishment, went on.
<p/>'' You seem to wonder; but if you will get me fairly at it, I'll make a clean breast of it.
<p/>Strip it of all its ornament, run it down to the root and nucleus of the whole, and what is it?
<p/>Why, because my brother Quashy is ignorant and weak, and I am intelligent and strong,--because I know how, and can do it,--therefore, I may steal all he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has, keep it, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) only such and so much as suits my fancy.
<p/>This cursed business, accursed of God and man, what is it? Whatever is too hard, too dirty, too disagreeable, for me, I may set Quashy to doing.
<p/>Because I don't like work, Quashy shall work. Because the sun burns me, Quashy shall stay in the sun. Quashy shall earn the money, and I will spend it.
<p/>Quashy shall do my will, and not his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), all the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mortal life, and have such chance of getting to heaven, at last, as I find convenient.
<p/>Quashy shall lie down in every puddle, that I may walk over dry-shod. This I take to be about what slavery is .
<p/>I defy anybody on earth to read our slave-code, as it stands in our law-books, and make anything else of it.
<p/>And the only reason why the land don't sink under it, like Sodom and Gomorrah, is because it is used in a way infinitely better than it is.
<p/>For pity's sake, for shame's sake, because we are men born of women, and not savage beasts, many of us do not, and dare not,--we would scorn to use the full power which our savage laws put into our hands.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) who goes the furthest, and does the worst, only uses within limits the power that the law gives him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>).
<p/>St. Clare had started up, and, as his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) manner was when excited, was walking, with hurried steps, up and down the floor.
<p/>Talk of the abuses of slavery! Humbug! The thing itself is the essence of all abuse! '' His (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) fine face, classic as that of a Greek statue, seemed actually to burn with the fervor of his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) large blue eyes flashed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) gestured with an unconscious eagerness. Miss Ophelia had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) in this mood before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) sat perfectly silent.
<p/>I declare to you,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>), suddenly stopping before his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) cousin ''-LRB-It's no sort of use to talk or to feel on this subject-RRB-, but I declare to you, there have been times when I have thought, if the whole country would sink, and hide all this injustice and misery from the light, I would willingly sink with it.
<p/>When I have been travelling up and down on our boats, or about on my collecting tours, and reflected that every brutal, disgusting, mean, low-lived fellow I met, was allowed by our laws to become absolute despot of as many men, women and children, as he (<font color='blue'><b>despot</b></font>) could cheat, steal, or gamble money enough to buy,--when I have seen such men in actual ownership of helpless children, of young girls and women,--I have been ready to curse my country, to curse the human race!''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Augustine! Augustine! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``I'm sure you've said enough. I never, in my life, heard anything like this, even at the North.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At the North!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, with a sudden change of expression, and resuming something of his (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) habitual careless tone. ''
<p/>Pooh! your northern folks are cold-blooded; you are cool in everything! You can't begin to curse up hill and down as we can, when we get fairly at it.''
<p/>'' Well, but the question is,'' said Miss Ophelia. '' O, yes, to be sure, the question is ,--and a deuce of a question it is!
<p/>How came you in this state of sin and misery? Well, I shall answer in the good old words you used to teach me, Sundays.
<p/>My servants were my father's, and, what is more, my mother's; and now they are mine, they and their increase, which bids fair to be a pretty considerable item.
<p/>I came so by ordinary generation. My father, you know, came first from New England; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was just such another man as your father,--a
<p/>Your father settled down in New England, to rule over rocks and stones, and to force an existence out of Nature; and mine settled in Louisiana, to rule over men and women, and force existence out of them.
<p/>My mother,'' said St. Clare, getting up and walking to a picture at the end of the room, and gazing upward with a face fervent with veneration, '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was divine!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) probably was of mortal birth; but, as far as ever I could observe, there was no trace of any human weakness or error about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); and everybody that lives to remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), whether bond or free, servant, acquaintance, relation, all say the same.
<p/>regular old Roman,--upright , energetic, noble-minded, with an iron will. Don't look at me so!--you know what I mean! Why, cousin, that mother has been all that has stood between me and utter unbelief for years.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a direct embodiment and personification of the New Testament,--a living fact, to be accounted for, and to be accounted for in no other way than by its truth.
<p/>mother!'' said St. Clare, clasping his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) hands, in a sort of transport; and then suddenly checking himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) came back, and seating himself on an ottoman
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``My brother and I were twins; and they say, you know, that twins ought to resemble each other; but we were in all points a contrast.
<p/>O, mother! He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had black, fiery eyes, coal-black hair, a strong, fine Roman profile, and a rich brown complexion. I had blue eyes, golden hair, a Greek outline, and fair complexion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was generous to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) friends and equals, but proud, dominant, overbearing, to inferiors, and utterly unmerciful to whatever set itself up against him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was active and observing, I dreamy and inactive. Truthful we both were; he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) from pride and courage, I from a sort of abstract ideality.
<p/>We loved each other about as boys generally do,--off and on, and in general;--he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was my father's pet, and I my mother's.
<p/>There was a morbid sensitiveness and acuteness of feeling in me on all possible subjects, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) and my father had no kind of understanding, and with which they could have no possible sympathy.
<p/>But mother did; and so, when I had quarreled with Alfred, and father looked sternly on me, I used to go off to mother's room, and sit by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>I remember just how she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to look, with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pale cheeks, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deep, soft, serious eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) white dress,--she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) always wore white; and I used to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) whenever I read in Revelations about the saints that were arrayed in fine linen, clean and white.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a great deal of genius of one sort and another, particularly in music; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to sit at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) organ, playing fine old majestic music of the Catholic church, and singing with a voice more like an angel than a mortal woman; and I would lay my head down on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap, and cry, and dream, and feel,--oh, immeasurably!--things that I had no language to say! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In those days, this matter of slavery had never been canvassed as it has now; nobody dreamed of any harm in it.
<p/>I think, in some preexistent state, he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) must have been in the higher circles of spirits, and brought all his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) old court pride along with him (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>); for it was ingrain, bred in the bone, though he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was originally of poor and not in any way of noble family.
<p/>'' '' My father was a born aristocrat. My brother was begotten in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) image. '' Now, an aristocrat, you know, the world over, has no human sympathies, beyond a certain line in society.
<p/>In England the line is in one place, in Burmah in another, and in America in another; but the aristocrat of all these countries never goes over it.
<p/>What would be hardship and distress and injustice in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own class, is a cool matter of course in another one.
<p/>Among his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) equals , never was a man more just and generous; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) considered the negro, through all possible gradations of color, as an intermediate link between man and animals, and graded all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ideas of justice or generosity on this hypothesis.
<p/>I suppose, to be sure, if anybody had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), plump and fair, whether they had human immortal souls, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have hemmed and hawed, and said yes.
<p/>But my father was not a man much troubled with spiritualism; religious sentiment he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had none, beyond a veneration for God, as decidedly the head of the upper classes.
<p/>Well, my father worked some five hundred negroes; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was an inflexible, driving, punctilious business man; everything was to move by system,--to be sustained with unfailing accuracy and precision.
<p/>Now, if you take into account that all this was to be worked out by a set of lazy, twaddling, shiftless laborers, who had grown up, all their lives, in the absence of every possible motive to learn how to do anything but `shirk,' as you Vermonters say, and you'll see that there might naturally be, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plantation, a great many things that looked horrible and distressing to a sensitive child, like me.
<p/>My father's dividing line was that of color. '' '' Besides all, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had an overseer,--great, tall, slab-sided, two-fisted renegade son of Vermont---LRB-begging
<p/>your pardon-RRB-,--who had gone through a regular apprenticeship in hardness and brutality and taken his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) degree to be admitted to practice.
<p/>My mother never could endure him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), nor I; but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) obtained an entire ascendency over my father; and this man was the absolute despot of the estate.
<p/>I was a little fellow then, but I had the same love that I have now for all kinds of human things,--a kind of passion for the study of humanity, come in what shape it would.
<p/>I was found in the cabins and among the field-hands a great deal, and, of course, was a great favorite; and all sorts of complaints and grievances were breathed in my ear; and I told them to mother, and we, between us, formed a sort of committee for a redress of grievances.
<p/>We hindered and repressed a great deal of cruelty, and congratulated ourselves on doing a vast deal of good, till, as often happens, my zeal overacted.
<p/>Father was a fond, indulgent husband, but a man that never flinched from anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) thought necessary; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) foot, like a rock, between us and the field-hands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) told my mother, in language perfectly respectful and deferential, but quite explicit, that over the house-servants she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should be entire mistress, but that with the field-hands he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) could allow no interference.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) revered and respected her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) above all living beings; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) would have said it all the same to the virgin Mary herself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had come in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) system.
<p/>'' Stubbs complained to my father that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) couldn't manage the hands, and must resign his (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) position. '' I used sometimes to hear my mother reasoning cases with him (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>),--endeavoring to excite his (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) sympathies.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) would listen to the most pathetic appeals with the most discouraging politeness and equanimity. ' It all resolves itself into this,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) would say; `must I part with Stubbs, or keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>)?
<p/>We can't have perfection; and if I keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>), I must sustain his (<font color='blue'><b>Stubbs</b></font>) administration as a whole , even if there are, now and then, things that are exceptionable.
<p/>Stubbs is the soul of punctuality, honesty, and efficiency,--a thorough business hand, and as humane as the general run. All government includes some necessary hardness.
<p/>General rules will bear hard on particular cases.' This last maxim my father seemed to consider a settler in most alleged cases of cruelty.
<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said that , he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) commonly drew up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet on the sofa, like a man that has disposed of a business, and betook himself to a nap, or the newspaper, as the case might be.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could have divided Poland as easily as an orange, or trod on Ireland as quietly and systematically as any man living.
<p/>'' The fact is my father showed the exact sort of talent for a statesman. At last my mother gave up, in despair.
<p/>It never will be known, till the last account, what noble and sensitive natures like hers have felt, cast, utterly helpless, into what seems to them an abyss of injustice and cruelty, and which seems so to nobody about them.
<p/>It has been an age of long sorrow of such natures, in such a hell-begotten sort of world as ours. What remained for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but to train her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own views and sentiments?
<p/>From the cradle, Alfred was an aristocrat; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) grew up, instinctively, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) sympathies and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) reasonings were in that line, and all mother's exhortations went to the winds.
<p/>Well, after all you say about training, children will grow up substantially what they are by nature, and only that. As to me, they sunk deep into me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) never contradicted, in form, anything my father said, or seemed directly to differ from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) impressed, burnt into my very soul, with all the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) deep, earnest nature, an idea of the dignity and worth of the meanest human soul.
<p/>I have looked in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face with solemn awe, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would point up to the stars in the evening, and say to me, `See there, Auguste!
<p/>the poorest, meanest soul on our place will be living, when all these stars are gone forever,--will live as long as God lives!'
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Auguste</b></font>) had some fine old paintings; one, in particular, of Jesus healing a blind man. They were very fine, and used to impress me strongly. '
<p/>See there, Auguste,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Auguste</b></font>) would say; `the blind man was a beggar, poor and loathsome; therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not heal him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) afar off!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! Remember this, my boy.' If I had lived to grow up under her (<font color='blue'><b>Auguste</b></font>) care, she (<font color='blue'><b>Auguste</b></font>) might have stimulated me to
<p/>I know not what of enthusiasm. I might have been a saint, reformer, martyr,--but, alas! alas! I went from her (<font color='blue'><b>Auguste</b></font>) when I was only thirteen, and I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Auguste</b></font>) again!''
<p/>St. Clare rested his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) hands, and did not speak for some minutes. After a while, he (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) looked up, and went on: <div class="bookquote">``What poor, mean trash this whole business of human virtue is!
<p/>A mere matter, for the most part, of latitude and longitude, and geographical position, acting with natural temperament. The greater part is nothing but an accident!
<p/>Your father, for example, settles in Vermont, in a town where all are, in fact, free and equal; becomes a regular church member and deacon, and in due time joins an Abolition society, and thinks us all little better than heathens.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>deacon</b></font>) is, for all the world, in constitution and habit, a duplicate of my father. I can see it leaking out in fifty different ways,--just the same strong, overbearing, dominant spirit.
<p/>You know very well how impossible it is to persuade some of the folks in your village that Squire Sinclair does not feel above them.
<p/>The fact is, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) has fallen on democratic times, and embraced a democratic theory, he (<font color='blue'><b>Squire</b></font>) is to the heart an aristocrat, as much as my father, who ruled over five or six hundred slaves.
<p/>Miss Ophelia felt rather disposed to cavil at this picture, and was laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) knitting to begin, but St. Clare stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Now, I know every word you are going to say. I do not say they were alike, in fact.
<p/>One fell into a condition where everything acted against the natural tendency, and the other where everything acted for it; and so one turned out a pretty wilful, stout, overbearing old democrat, and the other a wilful, stout old despot.
<p/>If both had owned plantations in Louisiana, they would have been as like as two old bullets cast in the same mould.
<p/>'' '' What an undutiful boy you are!'' said Miss Ophelia. '' I don't mean them any disrespect,'' said St. Clare.
<p/>But, to go back to my history: <div class="bookquote">``When father died, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left the whole property to us twin boys, to be divided as we should agree.
<p/>There does not breathe on God's earth a nobler-souled, more generous fellow, than Alfred, in all that concerns his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) equals; and we got on admirably with this property question, without a single unbrotherly word or feeling.
<p/>We undertook to work the plantation together; and Alfred, whose outward life and capabilities had double the strength of mine, became an enthusiastic planter, and a wonderfully successful one.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You know reverence is not my forte. '' But two years' trial satisfied me that I could not be a partner in that matter.
<p/>To have a great gang of seven hundred, whom I could not know personally, or feel any individual interest in, bought and driven, housed, fed, worked like so many horned cattle, strained up to military precision,--the question of how little of life's commonest enjoyments would keep them in working order being a constantly recurring problem,--the necessity of drivers and overseers,--the ever-necessary whip, first, last, and
<p/>only argument,--the whole thing was insufferably disgusting and loathsome to me; and when I thought of my mother's estimate of one poor human soul, it became even frightful!
<p/>To this day, I have no patience with the unutterable trash that some of your patronizing Northerners have made up, as in their zeal to apologize for our sins.
<p/>Tell me that any man living wants to work all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days, from day-dawn till dark, under the constant eye of a master, without the power of putting forth one irresponsible volition, on the same dreary, monotonous, unchanging toil, and all for two pairs of pantaloons and a pair of shoes a year, with enough food and shelter to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in working order!
<p/>Any man who thinks that human beings can, as a general thing, be made about as comfortable that way as any other, I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might try it.
<p/>'' It's all nonsense to talk to me about slaves enjoying all this! We all know better. I'd buy the dog, and work him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with a clear conscience!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I always have supposed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``that you, all of you, approved of these things, and thought them right --according to Scripture.
<p/>Alfred who is as determined a despot as ever walked, does not pretend to this kind of defence;--no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) stands, high and haughty, on that good old respectable ground, the right of the strongest ; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) says, and I think quite sensibly, that the American planter is `only doing, in another form, what the English aristocracy and capitalists are doing by the lower classes;' that is, I take it, appropriating them, body and bone, soul and spirit, to their use and convenience.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Humbug! We are not quite reduced to that yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) defends both,--and I think, at least, consistently . He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) says that there can be no high civilization without enslavement of the masses, either nominal or real.
<p/>There must, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) says, be a lower class, given up to physical toil and confined to an animal nature; and a higher one thereby acquires leisure and wealth for a more expanded intelligence and improvement, and becomes the directing soul of the lower.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) reasons, because, as I said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) is born an aristocrat;--so I don't believe, because I was born a democrat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How in the world can the two things be compared?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' The English laborer is not sold, traded, parted from his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) family, whipped.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) is as much at the will of his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) employer as if he (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) were sold to him (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>). The slave-owner can whip his (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) refractory slave to death,--the capitalist can starve him (<font color='blue'><b>laborer</b></font>) to death.
<p/>As to family security, it is hard to say which is the worst,--to have one's children sold, or see them starve to death at home.''
<p/>'' But it's no kind of apology for slavery, to prove that it isn't worse than some other bad thing. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I didn't give it for one,--nay, I'll say, besides, that ours is the more bold and palpable infringement of human rights; actually buying a man up, like a horse,--looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth, cracking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joints, and trying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paces and then paying down for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--having speculators, breeders, traders, and brokers in human bodies and souls,--sets the thing before the eyes of the civilized world in a more tangible form, though the thing done be, after all, in its nature, the same; that is, appropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of another without any regard to their own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, I've travelled in England some, and I've looked over a good many documents as to the state of their lower classes; and I really think there is no denying
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never thought of the matter in this light,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' Alfred, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) says that his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) slaves are better off than a large class of the population of England.
<p/>You see, you must not infer, from what I have told you, that Alfred is what is called a hard master; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) isn't.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) is despotic, and unmerciful to insubordination; he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) would shoot a fellow down with as little remorse as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) would shoot a buck, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) opposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>).
<p/>When I was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), I insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) should do something for their instruction; and, to please me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) did get a chaplain, and used to have them catechized Sunday, though, I believe, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) heart, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) thought it would do about as much good to set a chaplain over his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) dogs and horses.
<p/>And the fact is, that a mind stupefied and animalized by every bad influence from the hour of birth, spending the whole of every week-day in unreflecting toil, cannot be done much with by a few hours on Sunday.
<p/>The teachers of Sunday-schools among the manufacturing population of England, and among plantation-hands in our country, could perhaps testify to the same result, there and here .
<p/>Yet some striking exceptions there are among us, from the fact that the negro is naturally more impressible to religious sentiment than the white.
<p/>But, in general, he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) takes a sort of pride in having his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) slaves comfortably fed and accommodated. '' '' '' Well,'' said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``how came you to give up your plantation life?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) thought it absurd, after he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) had reformed, and altered, and improved everywhere, to suit my notions, that I still remained unsatisfied.
<p/>The fact was, it was, after all, the THING that I hated--the using these men and women, the perpetuation of all this ignorance, brutality and vice,--just to make money for me! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Well, we jogged on together some time, till Alfred saw plainly that I was no planter. Besides, I was always interfering in the details.
<p/>Being myself one of the laziest of mortals, I had altogether too much fellow-feeling for the lazy; and when poor, shiftless dogs put stones at the bottom of their cotton-baskets to make them weigh heavier, or filled their sacks with dirt, with cotton at the top, it seemed so exactly like what I should do if I were they, I couldn't and wouldn't have them flogged for it.
<p/>Well, of course, there was an end of plantation discipline; and Alf and I came to about the same point that I and my respected father did, years before.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me that I was a womanish sentimentalist, and would never do for business life; and advised me to take the bank-stock and the New Orleans family mansion, and go to writing poetry, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manage the plantation.
<p/>So we parted, and I came here.'' '' But why didn't you free your slaves?'' '' Well, I wasn't up to that.
<p/>To hold them as tools for money-making, I could not;--have them to help spend money, you know, didn't look quite so ugly to me.
<p/>Some of them were old house-servants, to whom I was much attached; and the younger ones were children to the old.
<p/>All were well satisfied to be as they were. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) paused, and walked reflectively up and down the room. ''
<p/>There was,'' said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``a time in my life when I had plans and hopes of doing something in this world, more than to float and drift.
<p/>I had vague, indistinct yearnings to be a sort of emancipator,--to free my native land from this spot and stain. All young men have had such fever-fits, I suppose, some
<p/>time,--but then-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia;--<div class="bookquote">``you ought not to put your hand to the plough, and look back.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/>I suppose it was a necessary incident to wisdom in us both; but, some how or other, instead of being actor and regenerator in society, I became a piece of driftwood, and have been floating and eddying about, ever since.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, well, things didn't go with me as I expected, and I got the despair of living that Solomon did. Alfred scolds me, every time we meet; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) has the better of me, I grant,--for
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) really does something; his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) life is a logical result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) opinions and mine is a contemptible non sequitur .
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>'' My dear cousin, can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation?'' '' Satisfied! Was I not just telling you I despised it?
<p/>But, then, to come back to this point,--we were on this liberation business. I don't think my feelings about slavery are peculiar.
<p/>The land groans under it; and, bad as it is for the slave, it is worse, if anything, for the master.
<p/>It takes no spectacles to see that a great class of vicious, improvident, degraded people, among us, are an evil to us, as well as to themselves.
<p/>The capitalist and aristocrat of England cannot feel that as we do, because they do not mingle with the class they degrade as we do.
<p/>They are in our homes; they are the associates of our children, and they form their minds faster than we can; for they are a race that children always will cling to and assimilate with.
<p/>I find many men who, in their hearts, think of it just as I do. If Eva, now, was not more angel than ordinary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) would be ruined.
<p/>We might as well allow the small-pox to run among them, and think our children would not take it, as to let them be uninstructed and vicious, and think our children will not be affected by that.
<p/>Yet our laws positively and utterly forbid any efficient general educational system, and they do it wisely, too; for, just begin and thoroughly educate one generation, and the whole thing would be blown sky high.
<p/>If we did not give them liberty, they would take it.'' '' And what do you think will be the end of this?'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>One thing is certain,--that there is a mustering among the masses, the world over; and there is a dies iræ coming on, sooner or later.
<p/>My mother used to tell me of a millennium that was coming, when Christ should reign, and all men should be free and happy.
<p/>'' I don't know. The same thing is working in Europe, in England, and in this country. And she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) taught me, when I was a boy, to pray, `thy kingdom come.'
<p/>Sometimes I think all this sighing, and groaning, and stirring among the dry bones foretells what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to tell me was coming.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Augustine, sometimes I think you are not far from the kingdom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, laying down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) knitting, and looking anxiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) cousin.
<p/>Thank you for your good opinion, but it's up and down with me,--up to heaven's gate in theory, down in earth's dust in practice.
<p/>But who may abide the day of His (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) appearing?'' '' But there's the teabell,--do let 's go,--and don't say, now, I haven't had one downright serious talk, for once in my life.
<p/>'' At table, Marie alluded to the incident of Prue. '' I suppose you'll think, cousin,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that we are all barbarians.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know it's impossible to get along with some of these creatures. They are so bad they ought not to live.

<p/>I remember father had a man that was so lazy he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would run away just to get rid of work, and lie round in the swamps, stealing and doing all sorts of horrid things.
<p/>That man was caught and whipped, time and again, and it never did him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any good; and the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crawled off, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) couldn't but just go, and died in the swamp.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I broke a fellow in, once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``that all the overseers and masters had tried their hands on in vain.

<p/>Nobody could do anything with him (<font color='blue'><b>African</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>African</b></font>) was sold round from overseer to overseer, till at last Alfred bought him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) could manage him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) was a regular African lion. They called him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) Scipio. Well, one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) knocked down the overseer, and was fairly off into the swamps.
<p/>Alfred was greatly exasperated; but I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) own fault, and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) any wager that I could break the man; and finally it was agreed that, if I caught him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I should have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to experiment on.
<p/>I was on a visit to Alf's plantation, for it was after we had dissolved partnership. So they mustered out a party of some six or seven, with guns and dogs, for the hunt.
<p/>People, you know, can get up as much enthusiasm in hunting a man as a deer, if it is only customary; in fact, I got a little excited myself, though I had only put in as a sort of mediator, in case he (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) was caught.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) ran and bounded like a buck, and kept us well in the rear for some time; but at last he (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) got caught in an impenetrable thicket of cane; then he (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) turned to bay, and I tell you he (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) fought the dogs right gallantly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) dashed them to right and left, and actually killed three of them with only his (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) naked fists, when a shot from a gun brought him (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) down, and he (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>) fell, wounded and bleeding, almost at my feet.
<p/>'' Well, the dogs bayed and howled, and we rode and scampered, and finally we started him (<font color='blue'><b>mediator</b></font>). The poor fellow looked up at me with manhood and despair both in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eye.
<p/>It was all I could do to keep them from shooting him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), in the flush of success; but I persisted in my bargain, and Alfred sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) to me.
<p/>Well, I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) in hand, and in one fortnight I had him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) tamed down as submissive and tractable as heart could desire.
<p/>I kept back the dogs and the party, as they came pressing up, and claimed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) as my prisoner. '' <div class="bookquote">``What in the world did you do to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie.
<p/>I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) to my own room, had a good bed made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), dressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) wounds, and tended him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) myself, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) got fairly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) feet again.
<p/>And, in process of time, I had free papers made out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) might go where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) liked.
<p/>'' Well, it was quite a simple process. '' '' And did he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) go?'' said Miss Ophelia. '' No. The foolish fellow tore the paper in two, and absolutely refused to leave me.
<p/>I never had a braver, better fellow,--trusty and true as steel. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) embraced Christianity afterwards, and became as gentle as a child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) used to oversee my place on the lake, and did it capitally, too. I lost him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) the first cholera season.
<p/>For I was sick, almost to death; and when, through the panic, everybody else fled, Scipio worked for me like a giant, and actually brought me back into life again.
<p/>In fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scipio</b></font>) laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Scipio</b></font>) life for me. But, poor fellow! he (<font color='blue'><b>Scipio</b></font>) was taken, right after, and there was no saving him (<font color='blue'><b>Scipio</b></font>).
<p/>Eva had come gradually nearer and nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told the story,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) small lips apart, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes wide and earnest with absorbing interest.
<p/>I never felt anybody's loss more. '' As he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) suddenly threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) arms around his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) neck, burst into tears, and sobbed convulsively.
<p/>what is the matter?'' said St. Clare, as the child's small frame trembled and shook with the violence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>'' Eva, dear child! '' This child,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``ought not to hear any of this kind of thing,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'s nervous.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, papa, I'm not nervous,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, controlling herself, suddenly, with a strength of resolution singular in such a child.
<p/>'' I'm not nervous, but these things sink into my heart . '' '' What do you mean, Eva?'' <div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you, papa, I think a great many thoughts.
<p/>Perhaps some day I shall tell you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, think away, dear,--only don't cry and worry your papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``Look here,--see
<p/>what a beautiful peach I have got for you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>Eva took it and smiled, though there was still a nervous twiching about the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>A few moments, and merry laughs were heard through the silken curtains, as Eva and St. Clare were pelting each other with roses, and chasing each other among the alleys of the court.
<p/>There is danger that our humble friend Tom be neglected amid the adventures of the higher born; but, if our readers will accompany us up to a little loft over the stable, they may, perhaps, learn a little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) affairs.
<p/>It was a decent room, containing a bed, a chair, and a small, rough stand, where lay Tom's Bible and hymn-book; and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sits, at present, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) slate before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), intent on something that seems to cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a great deal of anxious thought.
<p/>The fact was, that Tom's home-yearnings had become so strong that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had begged a sheet of writing-paper of Eva, and, mustering up all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) small stock of literary attainment acquired by Mas'r George's instructions, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) conceived the bold idea of writing a letter; and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was busy now, on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) slate, getting out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) first draft.
<p/>Tom was in a good deal of trouble, for the forms of some of the letters he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had forgotten entirely; and of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not know exactly which to use.
<p/>And while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was working, and breathing very hard, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) earnestness, Eva alighted, like a bird, on the round of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chair behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and peeped over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>'' Come, look at the gold-fish,'' said St. Clare, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hand and stepping on to the verandah. '' O, Uncle Tom!
<p/>I'm trying to write to my poor old woman, Miss Eva, and my little chil`en,'' said Tom, drawing the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes; <div class="bookquote">``but, some how, I'm feard
<p/>what funny things you are making, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>'' I shan't make it out. '' <div class="bookquote">``I wish I could help you, Tom!
<p/>So Eva put her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) golden head close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and the two commenced a grave and anxious discussion, each one equally earnest, and about equally ignorant; and, with a deal of consulting and advising over every word, the composition began, as they both felt very sanguine, to look quite like writing.
<p/>I've learnt to write some. Last year I could make all the letters, but I'm afraid I've forgotten. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, Uncle Tom, it really begins to look beautiful,'' said Eva, gazing delightedly on it.
<p/>'' How pleased your wife'll be, and the poor little children! O, it's a shame you ever had to go away from them!
<p/>I mean to ask papa to let you go back, some time.'' <div class="bookquote">``Missis said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) would send down money for me, as soon as they could get it together,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom.
<p/>George, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'d come for me; and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) gave me this yer dollar as a sign;'' and Tom drew from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) clothes the precious dollar.
<p/>And I wanted to send a letter, you know, to let 'em know whar I was, and tell poor Chloe that I was well
<p/>'' I'm `spectin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) will. Young Mas'r '' O, he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)'ll certainly come, then!'' said Eva. '' I'm so glad!'' '' off,--cause
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) felt so drefful, poor soul!'' <div class="bookquote">``I say Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare's voice, coming in the door at this moment. Tom and Eva both started.
<p/>'' What's here?'' said St. Clare, coming up and looking at the slate. '' O, it's Tom's letter. I'm helping him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to write it,'' said Eva; <div class="bookquote">``isn't it nice?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wouldn't discourage either of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``but I rather think, Tom, you'd better get me to write your letter for you.
<p/>It's very important he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should write,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said Eva, <div class="bookquote">``because his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mistress is going to send down money to redeem him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), you know, papa
<p/>St. Clare thought, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart, that this was probably only one of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants, to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited.
<p/>I'll do it, when I come home from my ride.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>'' ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) told me they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) so. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not make any audible comment upon it,--only ordered Tom to get the horses out for a ride.
<p/>Tom's letter was written in due form for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that evening, and safely lodged in the post-office. Miss Ophelia still persevered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) labors in the housekeeping line.
<p/>It was universally agreed, among all the household, from Dinah down to the youngest urchin, that Miss Ophelia was decidedly <div class="bookquote">``curis,'' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>--a term by which a southern servant implies that his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) betters don't exactly suit them.
<p/>The higher circle in the family--to wit, Adolph, Jane and Rosa--agreed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) was no lady; ladies never keep working about as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>)
<p/>did,--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) had no air at all; and they were surprised that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) should be any relation of the St. Clares.
<p/>Even Marie declared that it was absolutely fatiguing to see Cousin Ophelia always so busy. And, in fact, Miss Ophelia's industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the complaint.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) sewed and stitched away, from daylight till dark, with the energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency; and then, when the light faded, and the work was folded away, with one turn out came the ever-ready knitting-work, and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was again, going on as briskly as ever.
<p/>One morning, while Miss Ophelia was busy in some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) domestic cares, St. Clare's voice was heard, calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) at the foot of the stairs.
<p/>It really was a labor to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). CHAPTER XX Topsy <div class="bookquote">``Come down here, Cousin, I've something to show you. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I've made a purchase for your department,--see here,'' said St. Clare; and, with the word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) pulled along a little negro girl, about eight or nine years of age.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was one of the blackest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) race; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) round shining eyes, glittering as glass beads, moved with quick and restless glances over everything in the room.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mouth, half open with astonishment at the wonders of the new Mas`r's parlor, displayed a white and brilliant set of teeth.
<p/>'' What is it?'' said Miss Ophelia, coming down, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) sewing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) hand. '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails, which stuck out in every direction.
<p/>The expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) face was an odd mixture of shrewdness and cunning, over which was oddly drawn, like a kind of veil, an expression of the most doleful gravity and solemnity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was dressed in a single filthy, ragged garment, made of bagging; and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) hands demurely folded before her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).
<p/>Altogether, there was something odd and goblin-like about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) appearance,--something, as Miss Ophelia afterwards said, <div class="bookquote">``so heathenish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>as to inspire that good lady with utter dismay; and turning to St. Clare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Augustine, what in the world have you brought that thing here for?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``For you to educate, to be sure, and train in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) should go. I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) was rather a funny specimen in the Jim Crow line.
<p/>Here, Topsy,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Crow</b></font>) added, giving a whistle, as a man would to call the attention of a dog, ``give us a song, now, and show us some of your dancing.
<p/>The black, glassy eyes glittered with a kind of wicked drollery, and the thing struck up, in a clear shrill voice, an odd negro melody, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) kept time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) hands and feet, spinning round, clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) hands, knocking her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) knees together, in a wild, fantastic sort of time, and producing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) throat all those odd guttural sounds which distinguish the native music of her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) race; and finally, turning a summerset or two, and giving a prolonged closing note, as odd and unearthly as that of a steam-whistle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) came suddenly down on the carpet, and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) hands folded, and a most sanctimonious expression of meekness and solemnity over her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) face, only broken by the cunning glances which she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) shot askance from the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>St. Clare, like a mischievous fellow as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was, appeared to enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) astonishment; and, addressing the child again, said, <div class="bookquote">``Topsy, this is your new mistress.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>Miss Ophelia stood silent, perfectly paralyzed with amazement. I'm going to give you up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>); see now that you behave yourself.''
<p/>'' Yes, Mas`r,'' said Topsy, with sanctimonious gravity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) wicked eyes twinkling as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) spoke. '' You're going to be good, Topsy, you understand,'' said St. Clare.
<p/>'' O yes, Mas`r,'' said Topsy, with another twinkle, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) hands still devoutly folded. '' Now, Augustine, what upon earth is this for?'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>Your house is so full of these little plagues, now, that a body can't set down their foot without treading on 'em.
<p/>I get up in the morning, and find one asleep behind the door, and see one black head poking out from under the table, one lying on the door-mat,--and they are mopping and mowing and grinning between all the railings, and tumbling over the kitchen floor!
<p/>'' What on earth did you want to bring this one for?'' <div class="bookquote">``For you to educate--didn't I tell you? You're always preaching about educating.
<p/>I thought I would make you a present of a fresh-caught specimen, and let you try your hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) up in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) should go.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I don't want her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), I am sure;--I have more to do with 'em now than I want to.'' ''
<p/>That's you Christians, all over!--you'll get up a society, and get some poor missionary to spend all his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) days among just such heathen.
<p/>But let me see one of you that would take one into your house with you, and take the labor of their conversion on yourselves!
<p/>No; when it comes to that, they are dirty and disagreeable, and it's too much care, and so on.'' <div class="bookquote">``Augustine, you know I didn't think of it in that light,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, evidently softening.
<p/>'' Well, it might be a real missionary work,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), looking rather more favorably on the child. St. Clare had touched the right string.
<p/>But,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I really didn't see the need of buying this one;--there are enough now, in your house, to take all my time and skill.
<p/>Miss Ophelia's conscientiousness was ever on the alert. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' Well, then, Cousin,'' said St. Clare, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) aside, <div class="bookquote">``I ought to beg your pardon for my good-for-nothing speeches.
<p/>Why, the fact is, this concern belonged to a couple of drunken creatures that keep a low restaurant that I have to pass by every day, and I was tired of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) screaming, and them beating and swearing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).
<p/>You are so good, after all, that there's no sense in them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) looked bright and funny, too, as if something might be made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>);--so
<p/>I bought her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), and I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to you. Try, now, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) a good orthodox New England bringing up, and see what it'll make of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).
<p/>Well, I'll do what I can,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) new subject very much as a person might be supposed to approach a black spider, supposing them to have benevolent designs toward it.
<p/>You know I haven't any gift that way; but I'd like you to try. '' '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)'s dreadfully dirty, and half naked,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Well, take her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) down stairs, and make some of them clean and clothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) up. '' Miss Ophelia carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to the kitchen regions.
<p/>'' Don't see what Mas'r St. Clare wants of `nother nigger!'' said Dinah, surveying the new arrival with no friendly air.
<p/>'' Won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) around under my feet, I know!'' <div class="bookquote">``Pah!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa/Miss Rosa</b></font>)</div>said Rosa and Jane, with supreme disgust; <div class="bookquote">``let her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) keep out of our way!
<p/>What in the world Mas'r wanted another of these low niggers for, I can't see!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>'' You go long! No more nigger dan you be, Miss Rosa,'' said Dinah, who felt this last remark a reflection on herself.
<p/>'' You seem to tink yourself white folks. You an't nerry one, black nor white, I'd like to be one or turrer.
<p/>Miss Ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that would undertake to oversee the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was forced to do it herself, with some very ungracious and reluctant assistance from Jane.
<p/>In fact, in this world, multitudes must live and die in a state that it would be too great a shock to the nerves of their fellow-mortals even to hear described.
<p/>Miss Ophelia had a good, strong, practical deal of resolution; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) went through all the disgusting details with heroic thoroughness, though, it must be confessed, with no very gracious air,--for endurance was the utmost to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) principles could bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) saw, on the back and shoulders of the child, great welts and calloused spots, ineffaceable marks of the system under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had grown up thus far, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) heart became pitiful within her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).
<p/>'' It is not for ears polite to hear the particulars of the first toilet of a neglected, abused child. <div class="bookquote">``See there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, pointing to the marks, <div class="bookquote">``don't that show she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)'s a limb?
<p/>We'll have fine works with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), I reckon. I hate these nigger young uns! so disgusting! I wonder that Mas'r would buy her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><p/>The <div class="bookquote">``young un''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>alluded to heard all these comments with the subdued and doleful air which seemed habitual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), only scanning, with a keen and furtive glance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) flickering eyes,
<p/>When arrayed at last in a suit of decent and whole clothing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hair cropped short to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head, Miss Ophelia, with some satisfaction, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) looked more Christian-like than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own mind began to mature some plans for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) instruction.
<p/>the ornaments which Jane wore in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ears. Sitting down before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) began to question her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). '' How old are you, Topsy?''
<p/>'' Dun no, Missis,'' said the image, with a grin that showed all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) teeth. '' Don't know how old you are?
<p/>Didn't anybody ever tell you? Who was your mother?'' <div class="bookquote">``Never had none!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child, with another grin. '' Never had any mother?
<p/>'' persisted Topsy, with another grin, that looked so goblin-like, that, if Miss Ophelia had been at all nervous, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) might have fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had got hold of some sooty gnome from the land of Diablerie; but Miss Ophelia was not nervous, but plain and business-like, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said, with some sternness, <div class="bookquote">``You mustn't answer me in that way, child; I'm not playing with you.
<p/>What do you mean? Where were you born?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never was born! Tell me where you were born, and who your father and mother were.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Never was born,''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>reiterated the creature, more emphatically; <div class="bookquote">``never had no father nor mother, nor nothin'. I was raised by a speculator, with lots of others.
<p/>Old Aunt Sue used to take car on us. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>The child was evidently sincere, and Jane, breaking into a short laugh, said, <div class="bookquote">``Laws, Missis, there's heaps of 'em.
<p/>Speculators buys 'em up cheap, when they's little, and gets 'em raised for market.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How long have you lived with your master and mistress?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws, Missis, those low negroes,--they can't tell; they don't know anything about time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane; ``they don't know what a year is; they don't know their own ages.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dun no, Missis.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is it a year, or more, or less?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dun no, Missis.''  (<font color='red'><b>God Topsy</b></font>)</div>'' Have you ever heard anything about God, Topsy?
<p/>'' The child looked bewildered, but grinned as usual. '' Do you know who made you?'' '' Nobody, as I knows on,'' said the child, with a short laugh.
<p/>The idea appeared to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) considerably; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eyes twinkled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I spect I grow'd. Don't think nobody never made me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you know how to sew?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, who thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) inquiries to something more tangible. ''
<p/>No, Missis.'' '' What can you do?--what did you do for your master and mistress?'' <div class="bookquote">``Fetch water, and wash dishes, and rub knives, and wait on folks.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Were they good to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child Ophelia</b></font>)</div>'' Spect they was,'' said the child, scanning Miss Ophelia cunningly. Miss Ophelia rose from this encouraging colloquy; St. Clare was leaning over the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) chair.
<p/>Miss Ophelia's ideas of education, like all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) other ideas, were very set and definite; and of the kind that prevailed in New England a century ago, and which are still preserved in some very retired and unsophisticated parts, where there are no railroads.
<p/>As nearly as could be expressed, they could be comprised in very few words: to teach them to mind when they were spoken to; to teach them the catechism, sewing, and reading; and to whip them if they told lies.
<p/>And though, of course, in the flood of light that is now poured on education, these are left far away in the rear, yet it is an undisputed fact that our grandmothers raised some tolerably fair men and women under this regime, as many of us can remember and testify.
<p/>At all events, Miss Ophelia knew of nothing else to do; and, therefore, applied her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) mind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) heathen with the best diligence she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) could command.
<p/>The child was announced and considered in the family as Miss Ophelia's girl; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was looked upon with no gracious eye in the kitchen, Miss Ophelia resolved to confine her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) sphere of operation and instruction chiefly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own chamber.
<p/>With a self-sacrifice which some of our readers will appreciate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) resolved, instead of comfortably making her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own bed, sweeping and dusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own chamber,--which
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had hitherto done, in utter scorn of all offers of help from the chambermaid of the establishment,--to condemn herself to the martyrdom of instructing Topsy to perform these operations,--ah, woe the day!
<p/>'' You find virgin soil there, Cousin; put in your own ideas,--you won't find many to pull up. '' Did any of our readers ever do the same, they will appreciate the amount of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) self-sacrifice.
<p/>Miss Ophelia began with Topsy by taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) chamber, the first morning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and mystery of bed-making.
<p/>Behold, then, Topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided tails wherein her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with well-starched apron, standing reverently before Miss Ophelia, with an expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral.
<p/>'' Now, Topsy, I'm going to show you just how my bed is to be made. I am very particular about my bed.
<p/>You must learn exactly how to do it.'' '' Yes, ma'am,'' says Topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful earnestness.
<p/>'' Now, Topsy, look here;--this is the hem of the sheet,--this is the right side of the sheet, and this is the wrong;--will you remember?''
<p/>Well, now, the under sheet you must bring over the bolster,--so--and tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth,--so,--do you see?''
<p/>But the upper sheet,'' said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``must be brought down in this way, and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot,--so,--the narrow hem at the foot.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, ma'am,'' said Topsy, as before;--but we will add, what Miss Ophelia did not see, that, during the time when the good lady's back was turned in the zeal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) manipulations, the young disciple had contrived to snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had adroitly slipped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) sleeves, and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) hands dutifully folded, as before.
<p/>'' Yes, ma'am,'' says Topsy, with another sigh. '' '' Yes, ma'am,'' said Topsy, with profound attention. '' '' '' Now, Topsy, let's see you do this,'' said Miss Ophelia, pulling off the clothes, and seating herself.
<p/>Topsy, with great gravity and adroitness, went through the exercise completely to Miss Ophelia's satisfaction; smoothing the sheets, patting out every wrinkle, and exhibiting, through the whole process, a gravity and seriousness with which her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) instructress was greatly edified.
<p/>By an unlucky slip, however, a fluttering fragment of the ribbon hung out of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) sleeves, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was finishing, and caught Miss Ophelia's attention.
<p/>The ribbon was pulled out of Topsy's own sleeve, yet was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) not in the least disconcerted; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) only looked at it with an air of the most surprised and unconscious innocence.
<p/>Instantly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) pounced upon it. '' What's this? You naughty, wicked child,--you've been stealing this!'' '' Laws! why, that ar's Miss Feely's ribbon, an't it?
<p/>How could it a got caught in my sleeve? '' Topsy, you naughty girl, don't you tell me a lie,--you stole that ribbon!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Missis, I declar for 't , I didn't;--never seed it till dis yer blessed minnit.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Topsy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, ``don't you know it's wicked to tell lies?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I never tell no lies, Miss Feely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said Topsy, with virtuous gravity; <div class="bookquote">``it's jist the truth I've been a tellin now, and an't nothin else.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Topsy, I shall have to whip you, if you tell lies so.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Laws, Missis, if you's to whip all day, couldn't say no other way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said Topsy, beginning to blubber.
<p/>Miss Feeley must have left it on the bed, and it got caught in the clothes, and so got in my sleeve.
<p/>'' I never seed dat ar,--it must a got caught in my sleeve. '' Miss Ophelia was so indignant at the barefaced lie, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) caught the child and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).
<p/>'' Don't you tell me that again!'' The shake brought the glove on to the floor, from the other sleeve. ''
<p/>There, you!'' said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``will you tell me now, you didn't steal the ribbon? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>Topsy now confessed to the gloves, but still persisted in denying the ribbon.
<p/>'' Now, Topsy,'' said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``if you'll confess all about it, I won't whip you this time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>Thus adjured, Topsy confessed to the ribbon and gloves, with woful protestations of penitence.
<p/>I know you must have taken other things since you have been in the house, for I let you run about all day yesterday.
<p/>'' Well, now, tell me. Now, tell me if you took anything, and I shan't whip you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Laws, Missis! I took Miss Eva's red thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) wars on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) neck.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You did, you naughty child!--Well, what else?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I took Rosa's yer-rings,--them red ones.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go bring them to me this minute, both of 'em.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws, Missis! I can't,--they 's burnt up!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Burnt up!--what a story! Go get 'em, or I'll whip you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Topsy, with loud protestations, and tears, and groans, declared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) could not.
<p/>'' They 's burnt up,--they was. '' '' What did you burn 'em for?'' said Miss Ophelia. '' Cause I 's wicked,--I is.
<p/>I 's mighty wicked, any how. I can't help it. '' Just at this moment, Eva came innocently into the room, with the identical coral necklace on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) neck.
<p/>'' Why, Eva, where did you get your necklace?'' said Miss Ophelia. <div class="bookquote">``Get it? Why, I've had it on all day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva.
<p/>'' Did you have it on yesterday?'' '' Yes; and what is funny, Aunty, I had it on all night. I forgot to take it off when I went to bed.
<p/>Miss Ophelia looked perfectly bewildered; the more so, as Rosa, at that instant, came into the room, with a basket of newly-ironed linen poised on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) head, and the coral ear-drops shaking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) ears!
<p/>'' '' I'm sure I can't tell anything what to do with such a child!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) said, in despair. '' What in the world did you tell me you took those things for, Topsy?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Missis said I must `fess; and I couldn't think of nothin' else to `fess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said Topsy, rubbing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) eyes. ''
<p/>But, of course, I didn't want you to confess things you didn't do,'' said Miss Ophelia; <div class="bookquote">``that's telling a lie, just as much as the other.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws, now, is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said Topsy, with an air of innocent wonder. '' La, there an't any such thing as truth in that limb,'' said Rosa, looking indignantly at Topsy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no Rosa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, with an air of command, which the child could assume at times; <div class="bookquote">``you mustn't talk so, Rosa.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>If I was Mas'r St. Clare, I'd whip her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) till the blood run. I would,--I'd let her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) catch it!'' I can't bear to hear it.''
<p/>'' La sakes! Miss Eva, you 's so good , you don't know nothing how to get along with niggers. There's no way but
<p/>Don't you say another word of that sort!'' and the eye of the child flashed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) cheek deepened its color.
<p/>to cut 'em well up, I tell ye.'' <div class="bookquote">``Rosa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, <div class="bookquote">``hush! Rosa was cowed in a moment. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>Miss Eva has got the St. Clare blood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), that's plain.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) can speak, for all the world, just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) papa,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) passed out of the room. Eva stood looking at Topsy.
<p/>The fair, high-bred child, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) golden head, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) deep eyes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) spiritual, noble brow, and prince-like movements; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) black, keen, subtle, cringing, yet acute neighbor.
<p/>The Saxon, born of ages of cultivation, command, education, physical and moral eminence; the Afric, born of ages of oppression, submission, ignorance, toil and vice!
<p/>There stood the two children representatives of the two extremes of society. They stood the representatives of their races. Something, perhaps, of such thoughts struggled through Eva's mind.
<p/>But a child's thoughts are rather dim, undefined instincts; and in Eva's noble nature many such were yearning and working, for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had no power of utterance.
<p/>When Miss Ophelia expatiated on Topsy's naughty, wicked conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said, sweetly. '' Poor Topsy, why need you steal?
<p/>You're going to be taken good care of now. I'm sure I'd rather give you anything of mine, than have you steal it.
<p/>It was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) life; and the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild, rude heart, and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen, round, glittering eye; but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual grin.
<p/>the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely incredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness; and Topsy only thought Eva's speech something funny and inexplicable,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) did not believe it.
<p/>'' No! But what was to be done with Topsy? Miss Ophelia found the case a puzzler; her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) rules for bringing up didn't seem to apply.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would take time to think of it; and, by the way of gaining time, and in hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark closets, Miss Ophelia shut Topsy up in one till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) ideas further on the subject.
<p/>'' I don't see,'' said Miss Ophelia to St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``how I'm going to manage that child, without whipping her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>). ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, whip her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), then, to your heart's content; I'll give you full power to do what you like.'' <div class="bookquote">``Children always have to be whipped,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia; <div class="bookquote">``I never heard of bringing them up without.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Only I'll make one suggestion: I've seen this child whipped with a poker, knocked down with the shovel or tongs, whichever came handiest, &c.; and, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) is used to that style of operation, I think your whippings will have to be pretty energetic, to make much impression.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, well, certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare; <div class="bookquote">``do as you think best. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' What is to be done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), then?'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>What is to be done with a human being that can be governed only by the lash,-- that fails,--it's a very common state of things down here!''
<p/>'' You have started a serious question,'' said St. Clare; <div class="bookquote">``I wish you'd answer it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>I'm sure I don't know; I never saw such a child as this.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Such children are very common among us, and such men and women, too. How are they to be governed?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare.
<p/>The horrid cruelties and outrages that once and a while find their way into the papers,--such cases as Prue's, for example,--what
<p/>'' I'm sure it's more than I can say,'' said Miss Ophelia. '' Or I either,'' said St. Clare. '' do they come from?
<p/>In many cases, it is a gradual hardening process on both sides,--the owner growing more and more cruel, as the servant more and more callous.
<p/>I saw this very early when I became an owner; and I resolved never to begin, because I did not know when I should
<p/>Whipping and abuse are like laudanum; you have to double the dose as the sensibilities decline. stop,--and I resolved, at least, to protect my own moral nature.
<p/>The consequence is, that my servants act like spoiled children; but I think that better than for us both to be brutalized together.
<p/>You have talked a great deal about our responsibilities in educating, Cousin. I really wanted you to try with one child, who is a specimen of thousands among us.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is your system makes such children,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' I know it; but they are made ,--they exist,--and what is to be done with them?''
<p/>But, then, as it appears to be a duty, I shall persevere and try, and do the best I can,'' said Miss Ophelia; and Miss Ophelia, after this, did labor, with a commendable degree of zeal and energy, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) new subject.
<p/>'' Well, I can't say I thank you for the experiment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) instituted regular hours and employments for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), and undertook to teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to read and sew.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) learned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) letters as if by magic, and was very soon able to read plain reading; but the sewing was a more difficult matter.
<p/>The creature was as lithe as a cat, and as active as a monkey, and the confinement of sewing was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) abomination; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) broke her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) needles, threw them slyly out of the window, or down in chinks of the walls; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) tangled, broke, and dirtied her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) thread, or, with a sly movement, would throw a spool away altogether.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) motions were almost as quick as those of a practised conjurer, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) command of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) face quite as great; and though Miss Ophelia could not help feeling that so many accidents could not possibly happen in succession, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) could not, without a watchfulness which would leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) no time for anything else, detect her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) talent for every species of drollery, grimace, and mimicry,--for dancing, tumbling, climbing, singing, whistling, imitating every sound that hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) fancy,--seemed inexhaustible.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) play-hours, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) invariably had every child in the establishment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) heels, open-mouthed with admiration and wonder,--not excepting Miss Eva, who appeared to be fascinated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) wild diablerie, as a dove is sometimes charmed by a glittering serpent.
<p/>In the former art, the child was quick enough. Topsy was soon a noted character in the establishment. Miss Ophelia was uneasy that Eva should fancy Topsy's society so much, and implored St. Clare to forbid it.
<p/>'' Poh! let the child alone,'' said St. Clare. '' Topsy will do her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) good.'' '' But so depraved a child,--are
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) can't teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mischief; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) might teach it to some children, but evil rolls off Eva's mind like dew off a cabbage-leaf,--not a drop sinks in.''
<p/>you not afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) will teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) some mischief?'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't be too sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' I know I'd never let a child of mine play with Topsy.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, your children needn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``but mine may; if Eva could have been spoiled, it would have been done years ago.
<p/>It was very soon discovered that whoever cast an indignity on Topsy was sure to meet with some inconvenient accident shortly after;--either a pair of ear-rings or some cherished trinket would be missing, or an article of dress would be suddenly found utterly ruined, or the person would stumble accidently into a pail of hot water, or a libation of dirty slop would unaccountably deluge them from above when in full gala dress;-and on all these occasions, when investigation was made, there was nobody found to stand sponsor for the indignity.
<p/>Topsy was cited, and had up before all the domestic judicatories, time and again; but always sustained her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) examinations with most edifying innocence and gravity of appearance.
<p/>Nobody in the world ever doubted who did the things; but not a scrap of any direct evidence could be found to establish the suppositions, and Miss Ophelia was too just to feel at liberty to proceed to any length without it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>Topsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servants. They soon found reason to alter their opinion. The mischiefs done were always so nicely timed, also, as further to shelter the aggressor.
<p/>Thus, the times for revenge on Rosa and Jane, the two chamber maids, were always chosen in those seasons when -LRB-as not unfrequently happened-RRB- they were in disgrace with their mistress, when any complaint from them would of course meet with no sympathy.
<p/>In short, Topsy soon made the household understand the propriety of letting her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) alone; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was let alone, accordingly. Topsy was smart and energetic in all manual operations, learning everything that was taught her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) with surprising quickness.
<p/>With a few lessons, she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had learned to do the proprieties of Miss Ophelia's chamber in a way with which even that particular lady could find no fault.
<p/>Mortal hands could not lay spread smoother, adjust pillows more accurately, sweep and dust and arrange more perfectly, than Topsy, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
<p/>If Miss Ophelia, after three or four days of careful patient supervision, was so sanguine as to suppose that Topsy had at last fallen into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) way, could do without over-looking, and so go off and busy herself about something else, Topsy would hold a perfect carnival of confusion, for some one or two hours.
<p/>Instead of making the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would amuse herself with pulling off the pillowcases, butting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) woolly head among the pillows, till it would sometimes be grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in various directions; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would climb the posts, and hang head downward from the tops; flourish the sheets and spreads all over the apartment; dress the bolster up in Miss Ophelia's night-clothes, and enact various performances with that,--singing and whistling, and making grimaces at herself in the looking-glass; in short, as Miss Ophelia phrased it, <div class="bookquote">``raising Cain''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>generally.
<p/>On one occasion, Miss Ophelia found Topsy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) very best scarlet India Canton crape shawl wound round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) head for a turban, going on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) rehearsals before the glass in great style,--Miss
<p/>chose,--but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) didn't very often choose. Ophelia having, with carelessness most unheard-of in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), left the key for once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) drawer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Topsy! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would say, when at the end of all patience, <div class="bookquote">``what does make you act so?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dunno, Missis,--I spects cause I 's so wicked!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know anything what I shall do with you, Topsy.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Law, Missis, you must whip me; my old Missis allers whipped me.

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Ophelia tried the recipe, and Topsy invariably made a terrible commotion, screaming, groaning and imploring, though half an hour afterwards, when roosted on some projection of the balcony, and surrounded by a flock of admiring <div class="bookquote">``young uns,''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would express the utmost contempt of the whole affair.
<p/>'' Law, Miss Feely whip!--wouldn't kill a skeeter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Feely</b></font>) whippins. Oughter see how old Mas'r made the flesh fly; old Mas'r
<p/>know'd how! '' Topsy always made great capital of her (<font color='blue'><b>Feely</b></font>) own sins and enormities, evidently considering them as something peculiarly distinguishing.
<p/>'' Law, you niggers,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Feely</b></font>) would say to some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Feely</b></font>) auditors, <div class="bookquote">``does you know you 's all sinners? Well, you is--everybody is.

<p/>I spects I 's the wickedest critter in the world;''  (<font color='red'><b>auditors</b></font>)</div>and Topsy would cut a summerset, and come up brisk and shining on to a higher perch, and evidently plume herself on the distinction.
<p/>Miss Ophelia busied herself very earnestly on Sundays, teaching Topsy the catechism. Topsy had an uncommon verbal memory, and committed with a fluency that greatly encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) instructress.
<p/>'' What good do you expect it is going to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)?'' said St. Clare. '' Why, it always has done children good.
<p/>It's what children always have to learn, you know,'' said Miss Ophelia. '' Understand it or not,'' said St. Clare. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mine hasn't come to me yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``though I'll bear testimony that you put it into me pretty thoroughly when I was a boy.

<p/>I used to have great hopes of you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' Well, haven't you now?'' said St. Clare. '' I wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy, Augustine.''
<p/>'' So do I, that's a fact, Cousin,'' said St. Clare. '' Well, go ahead and catechize Topsy; may be you'll make out something yet.
<p/>Topsy, who had stood like a black statue during this discussion, with hands decently folded, now, at a signal from Miss Ophelia, went on:
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Our first parents, being left to the freedom of their own will, fell from the state wherein they were created.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia</b></font>)</div>Topsy's eyes twinkled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) looked inquiringly. '' What is it, Topsy?'' said Miss Ophelia. '' Please, Missis, was dat ar state Kintuck?''
<p/>'' What state, Topsy?'' <div class="bookquote">``Dat state dey fell out of. I used to hear Mas'r tell how we came down from Kintuck.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>St. Clare laughed. '' You'll have to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) a meaning, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'ll make one,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). '' There seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there.''
<p/>Well, I won't disturb the exercises again, on my honor;'' and St. Clare took his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) paper into the parlor, and sat down, till Topsy had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) recitations.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O! Augustine, be still,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia; <div class="bookquote">``how can I do anything, if you will be laughing?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>'' They were all very well, only that now
<p/>and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would oddly transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake, in spite of every effort to the contrary; and St. Clare, after all his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) promises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes, calling Topsy to him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to repeat the offending passages, in spite of Miss Ophelia's remonstrances.
<p/>'' How do you think I can do anything with the child, if you will go on so, Augustine? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) would say.
<p/>'' Well, it is too bad,--I won't again; but I do like to hear the droll little image stumble over those big words!''
<p/>'' But you confirm her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) in the wrong way. '' '' What's the odds? One word is as good as another to her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You wanted me to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) up right; and you ought to remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) is a reasonable creature, and be careful of your influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/>In very much this way Topsy's training proceeded, for a year or two,--Miss Ophelia worrying herself, from day to day, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), as a kind of chronic plague, to whose inflictions she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) became, in time, as accustomed, as persons sometimes do to the neuralgia or sick headache.
<p/>St. Clare took the same kind of amusement in the child that a man might in the tricks of a parrot or a pointer.
<p/>Topsy, whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) sins brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) into disgrace in other quarters, always took refuge behind his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chair; and St. Clare, in one way or other, would make peace for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).
<p/>From him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) got many a stray picayune, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) laid out in nuts and candies, and distributed, with careless generosity, to all the children in the family; for Topsy, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) justice, was good-natured and liberal, and only spiteful in self-defence.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is fairly introduced into our corps de ballet , and will figure, from time to time, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) turn, with other performers.
<p/>Our readers may not be unwilling to glance back, for a brief interval, at Uncle Tom's Cabin, on the Kentucky farm, and see what has been transpiring among those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had left behind.
<p/>It was late in the summer afternoon, and the doors and windows of the large parlor all stood open, to invite any stray breeze, that might feel in a good humor, to enter.
<p/>Mr. Shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room, and running through the whole length of the house, to a balcony on either end.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, dismal! so I ought; but, as Topsy herself says, 'I 's so wicked!' ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXI Kentuck Leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) heels in another, he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was enjoying his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) after-dinner cigar.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby sat in the door, busy about some fine sewing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) seemed like one who had something on her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) mind, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was seeking an opportunity to introduce.
<p/>'' Do you know,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that Chloe has had a letter from Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! has she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>)? Tom 's got some friend there, it seems.

(<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! well, I'm glad of it,--very glad,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shelby, heartily. '' Tom, I suppose, will get reconciled to a Southern residence;--hardly want to come up here again.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``On the contrary he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) inquires very anxiously,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``when the money for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) redemption is to be raised.

<p/>It's like jumping from one bog to another, all through a swamp; borrow of one to pay another, and then borrow of another to pay one,--and these confounded notes falling due before a man has time to smoke a cigar and turn round,--dunning letters and dunning messages,--all scamper and hurry-scurry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, ridiculous, Emily! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>But, at least,'' said Mrs. Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``could not you give me some little insight into yours; ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div><p/>I know somewhere about what things are likely to be; but there's no trimming and squaring my affairs, as Chloe trims crust off her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) pies.
<p/>And Mr. Shelby, not knowing any other way of enforcing his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) ideas, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) voice,--a mode of arguing very convenient and convincing, when a gentleman is discussing matters of business with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wife.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, bother! don't plague me, Emily!--I can't tell exactly. You don't know anything about business, I tell you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Shelby ceased talking, with something of a sigh.
<p/>The fact was, that though her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) husband had stated she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was a woman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) had a clear, energetic, practical mind, and a force of character every way superior to that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) husband; so that it would not have been so very absurd a supposition, to have allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) capable of managing, as Mr. Shelby supposed.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) heart was set on performing her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) promise to Tom and Aunt Chloe, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) sighed as discouragements thickened around her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>).
<p/>'' Don't you think we might in some way contrive to raise that money? Poor Aunt Chloe! her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) heart is so set on it!''
<p/>I'm not sure, now, but it's the best way to tell Chloe, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) mind to it.
<p/>'' I'm sorry, if it is. I think I was premature in promising. Tom'll have another wife, in a year or two; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had better take up with somebody else.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Shelby, I have taught my people that their marriages are as sacred as ours. I never could think of giving Chloe such advice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div><p/>'' It's a pity, wife, that you have burdened them with a morality above their condition and prospects. I always thought so.''
<p/>Well, well, Emily, I don't pretend to interfere with your religious notions; only they seem extremely unfitted for people in that condition.''
<p/>'' It's only the morality of the Bible, Mr. Shelby.'' '' '' They are, indeed,'' said Mrs. Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``and that is why, from my soul, I hate the whole thing.
<p/>If I can get the money no other way I will take music-scholars;--I could get enough, I know, and earn the money myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div><p/>I tell you, my dear, I cannot absolve myself from the promises I make to these helpless creatures. <div class="bookquote">``You wouldn't degrade yourself that way,
<p/>Emily? I never could consent to it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Degrade! would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the helpless?
<p/>Well, you are always heroic and transcendental,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Shelby, <div class="bookquote">``but I think you had better think before you undertake such a piece of Quixotism.
<p/>No, indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Shelby/Shelby</b></font>)</div>'' '' Here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of Aunt Chloe, at the end of the verandah.
<p/>'' If you please, Missis,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>). '' Well, Chloe, what is it?'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) mistress, rising, and going to the end of the balcony.
<p/>Chloe had a particular fancy for calling poultry poetry,--an application of language in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) always persisted, notwithstanding frequent corrections and advisings from the young members of the family.
<p/>'' If Missis would come and look at dis yer lot o' poetry. '' '' La sakes! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``I can't see;
<p/>Mrs. Shelby smiled as she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) saw a prostrate lot of chickens and ducks, over which Chloe stood, with a very grave face of consideration.

''  (<font color='red'><b>Aunt Chloe/Chloe</b></font>)</div>Chloe stood handling them over abstractedly; it was quite evident that the chickens were not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) was thinking of.
<p/>At last, with the short laugh with which her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) tribe often introduce a doubtful proposal, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Laws me, Missis! what should Mas'r and Missis be a troublin theirselves `bout de money, and not a usin

<p/>Yes, you may go; and your wages shall every cent of them be laid aside for your husband's redemption. '' As when a bright sunbeam turns a dark cloud to silver, so Chloe's dark face brightened immediately,--it really shone.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``The Grass Withereth--the Flower Fadeth''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Life passes, with us all, a day at a time; so it passed with our friend Tom, till two years were gone.
<p/>Though parted from all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) soul held dear, and though often yearning for what lay beyond, still was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never positively and consciously miserable; for, so well is the harp of human feeling strung, that nothing but a crash that breaks every string can wholly mar its harmony; and, on looking back to seasons which in review appear to us as those of deprivation and trial, we can remember that each hour, as it glided, brought its diversions and alleviations, so that, though not happy wholly, we were not, either, wholly miserable.
<p/>Tom read, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only literary cabinet, of one who had ``learned in whatsoever state he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was, therewith to be content.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) good and reasonable doctrine, and accorded well with the settled and thoughtful habit which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had acquired from the reading of that same book.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) letter homeward, as we related in the last chapter, was in due time answered by Master George, in a good, round, school-boy hand, that Tom said might be read <div class="bookquote">``most acrost the room.
<p/>It contained various refreshing items of home intelligence, with which our reader is fully acquainted: stated how Aunt Chloe had been hired out to a confectioner in Louisville, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) skill in the pastry line was gaining wonderful sums of money, all of which, Tom was informed, was to be laid up to go to make up the sum of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) redemption money; Mose and Pete were thriving, and the baby was trotting all about the house, under the care of Sally and the family generally.
<p/>Tom's cabin was shut up for the present; but George expatiated brilliantly on ornaments and additions to be made to it when Tom came back.
<p/>The rest of this letter gave a list of George's school studies, each one headed by a flourishing capital; and also told the names of four new colts that appeared on the premises since Tom left; and stated, in the same connection, that father and mother were well.
<p/>The style of the letter was decidedly concise and terse; but Tom thought it the most wonderful specimen of composition that had appeared in modern times.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was never tired of looking at it, and even held a council with Eva on the expediency of getting it framed, to hang up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) room.
<p/>Nothing but the difficulty of arranging it so that both sides of the page would show at once stood in the way of this undertaking.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXII '' '' The friendship between Tom and Eva had grown with the child's growth. It would be hard to say what place she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) held in the soft, impressible heart of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) faithful attendant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) gazed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) as the Italian sailor gazes on his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) image of the child Jesus,--with a mixture of reverence and tenderness; and to humor her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) graceful fancies, and meet those thousand simple wants which invest childhood like a many-colored rainbow, was Tom's chief delight.
<p/>In the market, at morning, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes were always on the flower-stalls for rare bouquets for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), and the choicest peach or orange was slipped into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket to give to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came back; and the sight that pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) most was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) sunny head looking out the gate for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) distant approach, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) childish questions,--<div class="bookquote">``Well, Uncle Tom, what have you got for me today?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) as something frail and earthly, yet almost worshipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) as something heavenly and divine. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Nor was Eva less zealous in kind offices, in return.
<p/>Though a child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was a beautiful reader;--a fine musical ear, a quick poetic fancy, and an instinctive sympathy with what's grand and noble, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) such a reader of the Bible as Tom had never before heard.
<p/>At first, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) read to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) humble friend; but soon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) own earnest nature threw out its tendrils, and wound itself around the majestic book; and Eva loved it, because it woke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) strange yearnings, and strong, dim emotions, such as impassioned, imaginative children love to feel.
<p/>The parts that pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) most were the Revelations and the Prophecies,--parts whose dim and wondrous imagery, and fervent language, impressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) the more, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) questioned vainly of their meaning;--and
<p/>All that they knew was, that they spoke of a glory to be revealed,--a wondrous something yet to come, wherein their soul rejoiced, yet knew not why; and though it be not so in the physical, yet in moral science that which cannot be understood is not always profitless.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) simple friend, the old child and the young one, felt just alike about it. For the soul awakes, a trembling stranger, between two dim eternities,--the eternal past, the eternal future.
<p/>The light shines only on a small space around her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>); therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) needs must yearn towards the unknown; and the voices and shadowy movings which come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) from out the cloudy pillar of inspiration have each one echoes and answers in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) own expecting nature.
<p/>Its mystic imagery are so many talismans and gems inscribed with unknown hieroglyphics; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) folds them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) bosom, and expects to read them when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) passes beyond the veil.
<p/>At this time in our story, the whole St. Clare establishment is, for the time being, removed to their villa on Lake Pontchartrain.
<p/>The heats of summer had driven all who were able to leave the sultry and unhealthy city, to seek the shores of the lake, and its cool sea-breezes.
<p/>St. Clare's villa was an East Indian cottage, surrounded by light verandahs of bamboo-work, and opening on all sides into gardens and pleasure-grounds.
<p/>The common sitting-room opened on to a large garden, fragrant with every picturesque plant and flower of the tropics, where winding paths ran down to the very shores of the lake, whose silvery sheet of water lay there, rising and falling in the sunbeams,--a picture never for an hour the same, yet every hour more beautiful.
<p/>It is now one of those intensely golden sunsets which kindles the whole horizon into one blaze of glory, and makes the water another sky.
<p/>The lake lay in rosy or golden streaks, save where white-winged vessels glided hither and thither, like so many spirits, and little golden stars twinkled through the glow, and looked down at themselves as they trembled in the water.
<p/>Tom and Eva were seated on a little mossy seat, in an arbor, at the foot of the garden. It was Sunday evening, and Eva's Bible lay open on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) knee.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) read,--<div class="bookquote">``And I saw a sea of glass, mingled with fire.''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tom,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, suddenly stopping, and pointing to the lake, <div class="bookquote">``there 't is.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said the child, pointing to the glassy water, which, as it rose and fell, reflected the golden glow of the sky.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What, Miss Eva?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Don't you see,--there? '' There's a `sea of glass, mingled with fire.''' <div class="bookquote">``True enough, Miss Eva,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom; and Tom sang--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, had I the wings of the morning, I'd fly away to Canaan's shore; Bright angels should convey me home, To the new Jerusalem.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where do you suppose new Jerusalem is, Uncle Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva. '' O, up in the clouds, Miss Eva. '' ''
<p/>Then I think I see it,'' said Eva. '' Look in those clouds!--they look like great gates of pearl; and you can see beyond them--far, far off--it's all gold.
<p/>Tom sung the words of a well-known Methodist hymn, <div class="bookquote">``I see a band of spirits bright, That taste the glories there; They all are robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.
<p/>Tom, sing about `spirits bright.' ''  (<font color='red'><b>Methodist</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Uncle Tom, I've seen them ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva. Tom had no doubt of it at all; it did not surprise him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the least.
<p/>They come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits;'' and Eva's eyes grew dreamy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) hummed, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``They are all robed in spotless white, And conquering palms they bear.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If Eva had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had been to heaven, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would have thought it entirely probable.

<p/>The child rose, and pointed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) little hand to the sky; the glow of evening lit her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes were bent earnestly on the skies.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where, Miss Eva? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'm going there ,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``to the spirits bright, Tom; I'm going, before long .
<p/>The faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust; and Tom thought how often he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had noticed, within six months, that Eva's little hands had grown thinner, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) skin more transparent, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) breath shorter; and how, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) ran or played in the garden, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) once could for hours, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) became soon so tired and languid.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had heard Miss Ophelia speak often of a cough, that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) medicaments could not cure; and even now that fervent cheek and little hand were burning with hectic fever; and yet the thought that Eva's words suggested had never come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) till now.
<p/>Yes, there have been; but their names are always on grave-stones, and their sweet smiles, their heavenly eyes, their singular words and ways, are among the buried treasures of yearning hearts.
<p/>In how many families do you hear the legend that all the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to the peculiar charms of one who is not .
<p/>It is as if heaven had an especial band of angels, whose office it was to sojourn for a season here, and endear to them the wayward human heart, that they might bear it upward with them in their homeward flight.
<p/>When you see that deep, spiritual light in the eye,--when the little soul reveals itself in words sweeter and wiser than the ordinary words of children,--hope not to retain that child; for the seal of heaven is on it, and the light of immortality looks out from its eyes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Has there ever been a child like Eva? Even so, beloved Eva! fair star of thy dwelling! Thou art passing away; but they that love thee dearest know it not.
<p/>The colloquy between Tom and Eva was interrupted by a hasty call from Miss Ophelia. '' Eva--Eva!--why, child, the dew is falling; you mustn't be out there!''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was from New England, and knew well the first guileful footsteps of that soft, insidious disease, which sweeps away so many of the fairest and loveliest, and, before one fibre of life seems broken, seals them irrevocably for death.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had noted the slight, dry cough, the daily brightening cheek; nor could the lustre of the eye, and the airy buoyancy born of fever, deceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) tried to communicate her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) fears to St. Clare; but he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) threw back her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) suggestions with a restless petulance, unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) usual careless good-humor.
<p/>Eva and Tom hastened in. Miss Ophelia was old, and skilled in the tactics of nursing. '' Don't be croaking, Cousin,--I hate it!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) would say; <div class="bookquote">``don't you see that the child is only growing. Children always lose strength when they grow fast.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) has that cough!'' <div class="bookquote">``O! nonsense of that cough!--it is not anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) has taken a little cold, perhaps.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eliza</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, that was just the way Eliza Jane was taken, and Ellen and Maria Sanders.'' ``O! stop these hobgoblin' nurse legends.
<p/>You old hands got so wise, that a child cannot cough, or sneeze, but you see desperation and ruin at hand.
<p/>Only take care of the child, keep her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) from the night air, and don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) play too hard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)'ll do well enough.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sanders</b></font>) watched Eva feverishly day by day, as might be told by the frequency with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sanders</b></font>) repeated over that <div class="bookquote">``the child was
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So St. Clare said; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Sanders</b></font>) grew nervous and restless. quite well''--that there wasn't anything in that cough,--it was only some little stomach affection, such as children often had.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Sanders</b></font>) kept by her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) more than before, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) oftener to ride with him (<font color='blue'><b>Sanders</b></font>), brought home every few days some receipt or strengthening mixture,--<div class="bookquote">``not,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Sanders</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that the child needed it, but then it would not do her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) any harm.
<p/>If it must be told, the thing that struck a deeper pang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sanders</b></font>) heart than anything else was the daily increasing maturity of the child's mind and feelings.
<p/>While still retaining all a child's fanciful graces, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) often dropped, unconsciously, words of such a reach of thought, and strange unworldly wisdom, that they seemed to be an inspiration.
<p/>At such times, St. Clare would feel a sudden thrill, and clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sanders</b></font>) arms, as if that fond clasp could save her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sanders</b></font>) heart rose up with wild determination to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), never to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) go.
<p/>Impulsively generous she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had always been; but there was a touching and womanly thoughtfulness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) now, that every one noticed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) still loved to play with Topsy, and the various colored children; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) now seemed rather a spectator than an actor of their plays, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would sit for half an hour at a time, laughing at the odd tricks of Topsy,--and then a shadow would seem to pass across her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes grew misty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thoughts were afar.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The child's whole heart and soul seemed absorbed in works of love and kindness. '' Mamma,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, suddenly, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother, one day, <div class="bookquote">``why don't we teach our servants to read?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What a question child! People never do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why don't they?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva. '' Because it is no use for them to read.
<p/>It don't help them to work any better, and they are not made for anything else. '' '' But they ought to read the Bible, mamma, to learn God's will.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O! they can get that read to them all they need. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It seems to me, mamma, the Bible is for every one to read themselves.
<p/>They need it a great many times when there is nobody to read it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Eva, you are an odd child,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mother.
<p/>'' Miss Ophelia has taught Topsy to read,'' continued Eva. '' Yes, and you see how much good it does. Topsy is the worst creature I ever saw!''
<p/>'' Here's poor Mammy!'' said Eva. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) does love the Bible so much, and wishes so she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) could read! And what will she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) do when I can't read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)?
<p/>Marie was busy, turning over the contents of a drawer, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Well, of course, by and by, Eva, you will have other things to think of besides reading the Bible round to servants.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Not but that is very proper; I've done it myself, when I had health. But when you come to be dressing and going into company, you won't have time.
<p/>See here!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``these jewels I'm going to give you when you come out. I wore them to my first ball.
<p/>I can tell you, Eva, I made a sensation. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Eva took the jewel-case, and lifted from it a diamond necklace.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) large, thoughtful eyes rested on them, but it was plain her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) thoughts were elsewhere. '' How sober you look child!'' said Marie.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are these worth a great deal of money, mamma?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' To be sure, they are. Father sent to France for them.
<p/>They are worth a small fortune. '' <div class="bookquote">``I wish I had them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, <div class="bookquote">``to do what I pleased with!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What would you do with them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd sell them, and buy a place in the free states, and take all our people there, and hire teachers, to teach them to read and write.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>Eva was cut short by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mother's laughing. <div class="bookquote">``Set up a boarding-school! Wouldn't you teach them to play on the piano, and paint on velvet?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I'd teach them to read their own Bible, and write their own letters, and read letters that are written to them,'' said Eva, steadily.
<p/>'' '' I know, mamma, it does come very hard on them that they can't do these things. Tom feels it--Mammy does,--a great many of them do.
<p/>I think it's wrong.'' <div class="bookquote">``Come, come, Eva; you are only a child! You don't know anything about these things,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``besides, your talking makes my head ache.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>Marie always had a headache on hand for any conversation that did not exactly suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>). Eva stole away; but after that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) assiduously gave Mammy reading lessons.
<p/>About this time, St. Clare's brother Alfred, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) eldest son, a boy of twelve, spent a day or two with the family at the lake.
<p/>Nature, instead of instituting resemblances between them, had made them opposites on every point; yet a mysterious tie seemed to unite them in a closer friendship than ordinary.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIII Henrique No sight could be more singular and beautiful than that of these twin brothers. They used to saunter, arm in arm, up and down the alleys and walks of the garden.
<p/>Augustine, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) blue eyes and golden hair, his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) ethereally flexible form and vivacious features; and Alfred, dark-eyed, with haughty Roman profile, firmly-knit limbs, and decided bearing.
<p/>They were always abusing each other's opinions and practices, and yet never a whit the less absorbed in each other's society; in fact, the very contrariety seemed to unite them, like the attraction between opposite poles of the magnet.
<p/>Henrique, the eldest son of Alfred, was a noble, dark-eyed, princely boy, full of vivacity and spirit; and, from the first moment of introduction, seemed to be perfectly fascinated by the spirituelle graces of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cousin Evangeline.
<p/>It was easy as a cradle, and as gentle as its little mistress; and this pony was now brought up to the back verandah by Tom, while a little mulatto boy of about thirteen led along a small black Arabian, which had just been imported, at a great expense, for Henrique.
<p/>Henrique had a boy's pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) new possession; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) advanced and took the reins out of the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) little groom, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked carefully over him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) brow darkened.
<p/>Eva had a little pet pony, of a snowy whiteness. '' What's this, Dodo, you little lazy dog! you haven't rubbed my horse down, this morning.''
<p/>'' Yes, Mas`r,'' said Dodo, submissively; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got that dust on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own self.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodo</b></font>)</div>'' You rascal, shut your mouth!'' said Henrique, violently raising his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) riding-whip.
<p/>The boy was a handsome, bright-eyed mulatto, of just Henrique's size, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) curling hair hung round a high, bold forehead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had white blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) veins, as could be seen by the quick flush in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cheek, and the sparkle of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eye, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) eagerly tried to speak.
<p/>Henrique struck him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) across the face with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) riding-whip, and, seizing one of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) arms, forced him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) on to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knees, and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was out of breath.
<p/>'' How dare you speak? '' '' Mas'r Henrique!--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began. '' There, you impudent dog! Now will you learn not to answer back when I speak to you?
<p/>Young Mas`r,'' said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``I specs what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was gwine to say was, that the horse would roll when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up from the stable; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s so full of spirits,--that
<p/>Take the horse back, and clean him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) properly. I'll teach you your place!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>'' 's the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got that dirt on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You hold your tongue till you're asked to speak!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Henrique, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heel, and walking up the steps to speak to Eva, who stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) riding-dress.
<p/>; I looked to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cleaning.'' '' Dear Cousin, I'm sorry this stupid fellow has kept you waiting,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>Let's sit down here, on this seat till they come. What's the matter, Cousin?--you look sober. '' <div class="bookquote">``How could you be so cruel and wicked to poor Dodo?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>asked Eva. <div class="bookquote">``Cruel,--wicked! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy, with unaffected surprise. '' What do you mean, dear Eva?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to call me dear Eva, when you do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva.
<p/>'' Dear Cousin, you don't know Dodo; it's the only way to manage him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>)'s so full of lies and excuses.
<p/>The only way is to put him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) down at once,--not let him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) open his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) mouth; that's the way papa manages. ''
<p/>'' But Uncle Tom said it was an accident, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never tells what isn't true.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s an uncommon old nigger, then!'' said Henrique.
<p/>'' Dodo will lie as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can speak.'' <div class="bookquote">``You frighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) into deceiving, if you treat him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) so. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Eva, you've really taken such a fancy to Dodo, that I shall be jealous.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' But you beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) didn't deserve it.''
<p/>A few cuts never come amiss with Dodo,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s a regular spirit, I can tell you; but I won't beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) again before you, if it troubles you.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, well, it may go for some time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) does, and don't get it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>Eva was not satisfied, but found it in vain to try to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) handsome cousin understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) feelings.
<p/>Dodo soon appeared, with the horses. '' Well, Dodo, you've done pretty well, this time,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) young master, with a more gracious air.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, now, and hold Miss Eva's horse while I put her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) on to the saddle. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dodo</b></font>)</div>Dodo came and stood by Eva's pony.
<p/>Henrique, who valued himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) gentlemanly adroitness in all matters of gallantry, soon had his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) fair cousin in the saddle, and, gathering the reins, placed them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dodo</b></font>) hands.
<p/>But Eva bent to the other side of the horse, where Dodo was standing, and said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) relinquished the reins,--<div class="bookquote">``That's a good boy, Dodo;--thank you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Dodo looked up in amazement into the sweet young face; the blood rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) cheeks, and the tears to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) face was troubled; his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) eyes looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had been crying. '' Here, Dodo,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) master, imperiously. Dodo sprang and held the horse, while his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) master mounted.
<p/>'' There's a picayune for you to buy candy with, Dodo,'' said Henrique; <div class="bookquote">``go get some. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrique</b></font>)</div>And Henrique cantered down the walk after Eva.
<p/>Dodo stood looking after the two children. One had given him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) money; and one had given him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wanted far more,--a kind word, kindly spoken.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) master had bought him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) at a slave warehouse, for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) handsome face, to be a match to the handsome pony; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was now getting his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) breaking in, at the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) young master.
<p/>Dodo had been only a few months away from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) mother. The scene of the beating had been witnessed by the two brothers St. Clare, from another part of the garden.
<p/>Augustine's cheek flushed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) only observed, with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) usual sarcastic carelessness. '' I suppose that's what we may call republican education, Alfred?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Henrique is a devil of a fellow, when his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) blood's up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred, carelessly. '' I suppose you consider this an instructive practice for him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>),'' said Augustine, drily.
<p/>'' I couldn't help it, if I didn't. Henrique is a regular little tempest;--his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) mother and I have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) up, long ago.
<p/>And this by way of teaching Henrique the first verse of a republican's catechism, `All men are born free and equal!'''
<p/>But, then, that Dodo is a perfect sprite,--no amount of whipping can hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>republican</b></font>).'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Poh! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred; <div class="bookquote">``one of Tom Jefferson's pieces of French sentiment and humbug.
<p/>It's perfectly ridiculous to have that going the rounds among us, to this day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, significantly.
<p/>Because,'' said Alfred, <div class="bookquote">``we can see plainly enough that all men are not born free, nor born equal; they are born anything else.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>For my part, I think half this republican talk sheer humbug. It is the educated, the intelligent, the wealthy, the refined, who ought to have equal rights and not the canaille.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course, they must be kept down , consistently, steadily, as I should ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) foot hard down as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) were standing on somebody.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you can keep the canaille of that opinion,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said Augustine. '' They took their turn once, in France.'' '' It makes a terrible slip when they get up,'' said Augustine,--<div class="bookquote">``in St. Domingo, for instance.
<p/>We must set our face against all this educating, elevating talk, that is getting about now; the lower class must not be educated.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Poh!''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred, <div class="bookquote">``we'll take care of that, in this country. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>That is past praying for,'' said Augustine; <div class="bookquote">``educated they will be, and we have only to say how.
<p/>We are breaking all humanizing ties, and making them brute beasts; and, if they get the upper hand, such we shall find them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>That's right,'' said St. Clare; <div class="bookquote">``put on the steam, fasten down the escape-valve, and sit on it, and see where you'll land.
<p/>Our system is educating them in barbarism and brutality. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>They shall never get the upper hand!'' said Alfred. '' ''
<p/>'' Well,'' said Alfred, <div class="bookquote">``we will see. I'm not afraid to sit on the escape-valve, as long as the boilers are strong, and the machinery works well.

<p/>I tell you,'' said Augustine, <div class="bookquote">``if there is anything that is revealed with the strength of a divine law in our times, it is that the masses are to rise, and the under class become the upper one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' That's one of your red republican humbugs, Augustine! Why didn't you ever take to the stump;--you'd make a famous stump orator!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Greasy or not greasy, they will govern you , when their time comes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said Augustine; <div class="bookquote">``and they will be just such rulers as you make them.
<p/>The French noblesse chose to have the people ' sans culottes ,' and they had ' sans culotte ' governors to their hearts' content.

<p/>as if we hadn't had enough of that abominable, contemptible Hayti! * The Haytiens were not Anglo Saxons; if they had been there would have been another story.
<p/>* In August 1791, as a consequence of the French Revolution, the black slaves and mulattoes on Haiti rose in revolt against the whites, and in the period of turmoil that followed enormous cruelties were practised by both sides.
<p/>The Anglo Saxon is the dominant race of the world, and is to be so . ''  (<font color='red'><b>The people</b></font>)</div>The <div class="bookquote">``Emperor''  (<font color='red'><b>the whites</b></font>)</div>Dessalines, come to power in 1804, massacred all the whites on the island.

<p/>There are plenty among them who have only enough of the African to give a sort of tropical warmth and fervor to our calculating firmness and foresight.
<p/>'' Well, there is a pretty fair infusion of Anglo Saxon blood among our slaves, now,'' said Augustine. '' If ever the San Domingo hour comes, Anglo Saxon blood will lead on the day.
<p/>Sons of white fathers, with all our haughty feelings burning in their veins, will not always be bought and sold and traded.
<p/>Well,'' said Augustine, <div class="bookquote">``there goes an old saying to this effect, `As it was in the days of Noah so shall it be;--they
<p/>They will rise, and raise with them their mother's race.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stuff!--nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' ate, they drank, they planted, they builded, and knew not till the flood came and took them.'''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``On the whole, Augustine, I think your talents might do for a circuit rider,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred, laughing. '' Never you fear for us; possession is our nine points.
<p/>We've got the power. This subject race,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>), stamping firmly, <div class="bookquote">``is down and shall stay down! We have energy enough to manage our own powder.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Sons trained like your Henrique will be grand guardians of your powder-magazines,'' said Augustine,--<div class="bookquote">``so cool and self-possessed! The proverb says, `They that cannot govern themselves cannot govern others.'''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>There is a trouble there'' said Alfred, thoughtfully; <div class="bookquote">``there's no doubt that our system is a difficult one to train children under.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>It gives too free scope to the passions, altogether, which, in our climate, are hot enough. I find trouble with Henrique.
<p/>I believe I shall send him (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) North for his (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) education, where obedience is more fashionable, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Alfred</b></font>) will associate more with equals, and less with dependents.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Since training children is the staple work of the human race,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said Augustine, <div class="bookquote">``I should think it something of a consideration that our system does not work well there.
<p/>The boy is generous and warm-hearted, but a perfect fire-cracker when excited. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' '' It does not for some things,'' said Alfred; <div class="bookquote">``for others, again, it does.
<p/>It makes boys manly and courageous; and the very vices of an abject race tend to strengthen in them the opposite virtues.
<p/>I think Henrique, now, has a keener sense of the beauty of truth, from seeing lying and deception the universal badge of slavery.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``A Christian-like view of the subject, certainly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said Augustine. '' It's true, Christian-like or not; and is about as Christian-like as most other things in the world,'' said Alfred.
<p/>'' That may be,'' said St. Clare. '' Well, there's no use in talking, Augustine. I believe we've been round and round this old track five hundred times, more or less.
<p/>The two brothers ran up the verandah steps, and were soon seated at a light bamboo stand, with the backgammon-board between them.
<p/>As they were setting their men, Alfred said, <div class="bookquote">``I tell you, Augustine, if I thought as you do, I should do something.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div><p/>What do you say to a game of backgammon? '' <div class="bookquote">``I dare say you would,--you are one of the doing sort,--but what?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>You might as well set Mount Ætna on them flat, and tell them to stand up under it, as tell me to elevate my servants under all the superincumbent mass of society upon them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, elevate your own servants, for a specimen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred, with a half-scornful smile. '' One man can do nothing, against the whole action of a community.
<p/>Education, to do anything, must be a state education; or there must be enough agreed in it to make a current.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You take the first throw,''  (<font color='red'><b>Alfred</b></font>)</div>said Alfred; and the brothers were soon lost in the game, and heard no more till the scraping of horses' feet was heard under the verandah.
<p/>'' There come the children,'' said Augustine, rising. '' Look here, Alf! Did you ever see anything so beautiful? '' And, in truth, it was a beautiful sight.
<p/>Henrique, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) bold brow, and dark, glossy curls, and glowing cheek, was laughing gayly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) bent towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Alf</b></font>) fair cousin, as they came on.
<p/>Exercise had given a brilliant hue to her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) cheeks, and heightened the effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) singularly transparent skin, and golden hair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) was dressed in a blue riding dress, with a cap of the same color. '' Good heavens! what perfectly dazzling beauty!'' said Alfred.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) will, too truly,--God knows I'm afraid so!''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, in a tone of sudden bitterness, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hurried down to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) off her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) horse.
<p/>'' I tell you, Auguste, won't she (<font color='blue'><b>Auguste</b></font>) make some hearts ache, one of these days? '' '' Eva darling! you're not much tired?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arms. '' No, papa,'' said the child; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) short, hard breathing alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father.
<p/>'' How could you ride so fast, dear?--you know it's bad for you. '' <div class="bookquote">``I felt so well, papa, and liked it so much
<p/>, I forgot. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>St. Clare carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) arms into the parlor, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) on the sofa. ''
<p/>Henrique, you must be careful of Eva,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you mustn't ride fast with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll take her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) under my care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Henrique</b></font>)</div>said Henrique, seating himself by the sofa, and taking Eva's hand.
<p/>Do you know, Eva, I'm sorry papa is only going to stay two days here, and then I shan't see you again for ever so long!
<p/>Eva soon found herself much better. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father and uncle resumed their game, and the children were left together. '' If I stay with you, I'd try to be good, and not be cross to Dodo, and so on.
<p/>I don't mean to treat Dodo ill; but, you know, I've got such a quick temper. I'm not really bad to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), though.
<p/>I give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a picayune, now and then; and you see he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) dresses well. I think, on the whole, Dodo 's pretty well off.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would you think you were well off, if there were not one creature in the world near you to love you?''

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I?--Well, of course not. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Well, I can't help it, as I know of.

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why can't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva. '' Love Dodo! Why, Eva, you wouldn't have me! I may like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) well enough; but you don't love your servants.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't the Bible say we must love everybody?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, the Bible! To be sure, it says a great many such things; but, then, nobody ever thinks of doing them,--you
<p/>know, Eva, nobody does. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>Eva did not speak; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes were fixed and thoughtful for a few moments. '' At any rate,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``dear Cousin, do love poor Dodo, and be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>), for my sake!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could love anything, for your sake, dear Cousin; for I really think you are the loveliest creature that I ever saw!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div><p/>Eva received it with perfect simplicity, without even a change of feature; merely saying, <div class="bookquote">``I'm glad you feel so, dear Henrique!
<p/>And Henrique spoke with an earnestness that flushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) handsome face. I hope you will remember. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>The dinner-bell put an end to the interview.
<p/>Two days after this, Alfred St. Clare and Augustine parted; and Eva, who had been stimulated, by the society of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) young cousin, to exertions beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) strength, began to fail rapidly.
<p/>St. Clare was at last willing to call in medical advice,--a thing from which he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had always shrunk, because it was the admission of an unwelcome truth.
<p/>But, for a day or two, Eva was so unwell as to be confined to the house; and the doctor was called.
<p/>Marie St. Clare had taken no notice of the child's gradually decaying health and strength, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was completely absorbed in studying out two or three new forms of disease to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) herself was a victim.
<p/>It was the first principle of Marie's belief that nobody ever was or could be so great a sufferer as herself ; and, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) always repelled quite indignantly any suggestion that any one around her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could be sick.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was always sure, in such a case, that it was nothing but laziness, or want of energy; and that, if they had had the suffering she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had, they would soon know the difference.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIV Foreshadowings Miss Ophelia had several times tried to awaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) maternal fears about Eva; but to no avail. ''
<p/>I don't see as anything ails the child,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) would say; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) runs about, and plays.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) has a cough.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Cough! you don't need to tell me about a cough. I've always been subject to a cough, all my days.
<p/>When I was of Eva's age, they thought I was in a consumption. Night after night, Mammy used to sit up with me.
<p/>O! Eva's cough is not anything.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) gets weak, and is short-breathed. '' <div class="bookquote">``Law! I've had that, years and years; it's only a nervous affection.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) sweats so, nights!'' '' Well, I have, these ten years. Very often, night after night, my clothes will be wringing wet.
<p/>There won't be a dry thread in my night-clothes and the sheets will be so that Mammy has to hang them up to dry!
<p/>But, now that Eva was fairly and visibly prostrated, and a doctor called, Marie, all on a sudden, took a new turn.
<p/>Eva doesn't sweat anything like that!'' Miss Ophelia shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) mouth for a season. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) knew it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) always felt it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was destined to be the most miserable of mothers.
<p/>eyes;'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>--and Marie routed up Mammy nights, and rumpussed and scolded, with more energy than ever, all day, on the strength of this new misery.
<p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) wretched health, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) only darling child going down to the grave before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) '' My dear Marie, don't talk so!'' said St. Clare.
<p/>'' You ought not to give up the case so, at once. '' '' You have not a mother's feelings, St. Clare!
<p/>You never could understand me!--you don't now. '' '' But don't talk so, as if it were a gone case!'' <div class="bookquote">``I can't take it as indifferently as you can, St. Clare.
<p/>If you don't feel when your only child is in this alarming state, I do. It's a blow too much for me, with all I was bearing before.
<p/>It's true,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``that Eva is very delicate, that I always knew; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) has grown so rapidly as to exhaust her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) strength; and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) situation is critical.
<p/>But just now she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) is only prostrated by the heat of the weather, and by the excitement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) cousin's visit, and the exertions she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) made.
<p/>Well, of course, if you can look on the bright side, pray do; it's a mercy if people haven't sensitive feelings, in this world.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' The physician says there is room for hope. '' '' I am sure I wish I didn't feel as I do; it only makes me completely wretched!
<p/>And the <div class="bookquote">``rest of them''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>had good reason to breathe the same prayer, for Marie paraded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) new misery as the reason and apology for all sorts of inflictions on every one about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>).
<p/>Every word that was spoken by anybody, everything that was done or was not done everywhere, was only a new proof that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was surrounded by hard-hearted, insensible beings, who were unmindful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) peculiar sorrows.
<p/>Poor Eva heard some of these speeches; and nearly cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) little eyes out, in pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mamma, and in sorrow that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) should make her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) so much distress.
<p/>In a week or two, there was a great improvement of symptoms,--one of those deceitful lulls, by which her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) inexorable disease so often beguiles the anxious heart, even on the verge of the grave.
<p/>Eva's step was again in the garden,--in the balconies; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) played and laughed again,--and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father, in a transport, declared that they should soon have her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) as hearty as anybody.
<p/>I wish I could be as easy as the rest of you!'' Miss Ophelia and the physician alone felt no encouragement from this illusive truce.
<p/>There was one other heart, too, that felt the same certainty, and that was the little heart of Eva. What is it that sometimes speaks in the soul so calmly, so clearly, that its earthly time is short?
<p/>Be it what it may, it rested in the heart of Eva, a calm, sweet, prophetic certainty that Heaven was near; calm as the light of sunset, sweet as the bright stillness of autumn, there her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) little heart reposed, only troubled by sorrow for those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) so dearly.
<p/>For the child, though nursed so tenderly, and though life was unfolding before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) with every brightness that love and wealth could give, had no regret for herself in dying.
<p/>In that book which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) simple old friend had read so much together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had seen and taken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) young heart the image of one who loved the little child; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) gazed and mused, He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had ceased to be an image and a picture of the distant past, and come to be a living, all-surrounding reality.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) love enfolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) childish heart with more than mortal tenderness; and it was to Him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was going, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) home.
<p/>Is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or the soul's impulsive throb, as immortality draws on? But her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) heart yearned with sad tenderness for all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was to leave behind.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father most,--for Eva, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) never distinctly thought so, had an instinctive perception that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was more in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart than any other.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mother because she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was so loving a creature, and all the selfishness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) only saddened and perplexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had a child's implicit trust that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mother could not do wrong.
<p/>There was something about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) that Eva never could make out; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) always smoothed it over with thinking that, after all, it was mamma, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) very dearly indeed.
<p/>Children do not usually generalize; but Eva was an uncommonly mature child, and the things that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had witnessed of the evils of the system under which they were living had fallen, one by one, into the depths of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) thoughtful, pondering heart.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had vague longings to do something for them,--to bless and save not only them, but all in their condition,--longings that contrasted sadly with the feebleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) little frame.
<p/>Uncle Tom,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, one day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was reading to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) friend, <div class="bookquote">``I can understand why Jesus wanted to die for us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) felt, too, for those fond, faithful servants, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was as daylight and sunshine. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, Miss Eva? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you; but, when I saw those poor creatures on the boat, you know, when you came up and I,--some had lost their mothers, and some their husbands, and some mothers cried for their little children--and when I heard about poor Prue,--oh, wasn't that dreadful!--and a great many other times, I've felt that I would be glad to die, if my dying could stop all this misery.
<p/>Because I've felt so, too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>'' What is it Miss Eva?--I don't understand. '' I would die for them, Tom, if I could,'' said the child, earnestly, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) little thin hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>Tom looked at the child with awe; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father's voice, glided away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes many times, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
<p/>'' It's jest no use tryin' to keep Miss Eva here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said to Mammy, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) met a moment after.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)'s got the Lord's mark in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) forehead.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) wasn't never like a child that's to live--there was allers something deep in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes. I've told Missis so, many the time; it's a comin' true,--we
<p/>It was late in the afternoon, and the rays of the sun formed a kind of glory behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) came forward in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) white dress, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) golden hair and glowing cheeks, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes unnaturally bright with the slow fever that burned in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) veins.
<p/>St. Clare had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to show a statuette that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had been buying for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); but her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) appearance, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) came on, impressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) suddenly and painfully.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) suddenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms, and almost forgot what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>). '' Eva, dear, you are better now-a-days,--are
<p/>you not?'' <div class="bookquote">``Papa,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, with sudden firmness ``I've had things I wanted to say to you, a great while. I want to say them now, before I get weaker.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) bosom, and said, <div class="bookquote">``It's all no use, papa, to keep it to myself any longer.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>St. Clare trembled as Eva seated herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) lap. The time is coming that I am going to leave you.

<p/>There's no doubt that this way is a very bad one; a great many people think so; I do myself I heartily wish that there were not a slave in the land; but, then, I don't know what is to be done about it!''

<p/>'' To our Saviour's home; it's so sweet and peaceful there--it is all so loving there!'' The child spoke unconsciously, as of a place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had often been.
<p/>'' Don't you want to go, papa? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said. St. Clare drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>), but was silent. ''
<p/>You will come to me,'' said the child, speaking in a voice of calm certainty which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) often used unconsciously. ''
<p/>The shadows of the solemn evening closed round them deeper and deeper, as St. Clare sat silently holding the little frail form to his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) saw no more the deep eyes, but the voice came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) as a spirit voice, and, as in a sort of judgment vision, his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) whole past life rose in a moment before his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) eyes: his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) mother's prayers and hymns; his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) own early yearnings and aspirings for good; and, between them and this hour, years of worldliness and scepticism, and what man calls respectable living.
<p/>I shall come after you. I shall not forget you. '' We can think much , very much, in a moment.
<p/>St. Clare saw and felt many things, but spoke nothing; and, as it grew darker, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) child to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) bed-room; and, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was prepared for rest; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sent away the attendants, and rocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, and sung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was asleep.
<p/>CHAPTER XXV The Little Evangelist It was Sunday afternoon. St. Clare was stretched on a bamboo lounge in the verandah, solacing himself with a cigar.
<p/>Marie lay reclined on a sofa, opposite the window opening on the verandah, closely secluded, under an awning of transparent gauze, from the outrages of the mosquitos, and languidly holding in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hand an elegantly bound prayer-book.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) was holding it because it was Sunday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) imagined she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been reading it,--though, in fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been only taking a succession of short naps, with it open in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Miss Ophelia, who, after some rummaging, had hunted up a small Methodist meeting within riding distance, had gone out, with Tom as driver, to attend it; and Eva had accompanied them.
<p/>I say, Augustine,'' said Marie after dozing a while, <div class="bookquote">``I must send to the city after my old Doctor Posey; I'm sure I've got the complaint of the heart.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>'' '' Well; why need you send for him (<font color='blue'><b>Posey</b></font>)? This doctor that attends Eva seems skilful.'' <div class="bookquote">``I would not trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Posey</b></font>) in a critical case,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``and I think I may say mine is becoming so! I've been thinking of it, these two or three nights past; I have such distressing pains, and such strange feelings.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Marie, you are blue; I don't believe it's heart complaint. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I dare say you don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``I was prepared to expect that .
<p/>You can be alarmed enough, if Eva coughs, or has the least thing the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>); but you never think of me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>If it's particularly agreeable to you to have heart disease, why, I'll try and maintain you have it,'' said St. Clare;
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I didn't know it was.''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I only hope you won't be sorry for this, when it's too late!'' said Marie;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but, believe it or not, my distress about Eva, and the exertions I have made with that dear child, have developed what I have long suspected.
<p/>St. Clare quietly made this commentary to himself, and went on smoking, like a hard-hearted wretch of a man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, till a carriage drove up before the verandah, and Eva and Miss Ophelia alighted.
<p/>Miss Ophelia marched straight to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own chamber, to put away her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) bonnet and shawl, as was always her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) manner, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) spoke a word on any subject; while Eva came, at St. Clare's call, and was sitting on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knee, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an account of the services they had heard.
<p/>They soon heard loud exclamations from Miss Ophelia's room, which, like the one in which they were sitting, opened on to the verandah and violent reproof addressed to somebody.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>What the exertions were which Marie referred to, it would have been difficult to state. '' What new witchcraft has Tops been brewing?'' asked St. Clare.
<p/>'' That commotion is of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) raising, I'll be bound! '' And, in a moment after, Miss Ophelia, in high indignation, came dragging the culprit along.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come out here, now!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said. '' I will tell your master!'' '' What's the case now?'' asked Augustine. '' The case is, that I cannot be plagued with this child, any longer!
<p/>Here, I locked her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) up, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) a hymn to study; and what does she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) do, but spy out where I put my key, and has gone to my bureau, and got a bonnet-trimming, and cut it all to pieces to make dolls' jackets!
<p/>It's past all bearing; flesh and blood cannot endure it! I never saw anything like it, in my life!'' <div class="bookquote">``I told you, Cousin,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie, <div class="bookquote">``that you'd find out that these creatures can't be brought up without severity.
<p/>If I had my way, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said, looking reproachfully at St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``I'd send that child out, and have her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thoroughly whipped; I'd have her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) whipped till she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) couldn't stand!''
 (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>I never saw above a dozen women that wouldn't half kill a horse, or a servant, either, if they had their own way with them!--let alone a man.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't doubt it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me of the lovely rule of woman! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>There is no use in this shilly-shally way of yours, St. Clare!'' said Marie.
<p/>Miss Ophelia had just the capability of indignation that belongs to the thorough-paced housekeeper, and this had been pretty actively roused by the artifice and wastefulness of the child; in fact, many of my lady readers must own that they should have felt just so in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) circumstances; but Marie's words went beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) felt less heat.
<p/>I wouldn't have the child treated so, for the world,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but, I am sure, Augustine, I don't know what to do.
<p/>I've taught and taught; I've talked till I'm tired; I've whipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>); I've punished her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) in every way I can think of, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>)'s just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) was at first.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Cousin is a woman of sense, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) sees it now, as plain as I do. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Come here, Tops, you monkey!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, calling the child up to him (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>).
<p/>Topsy came up; her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) round, hard eyes glittering and blinking with a mixture of apprehensiveness and their usual odd drollery. ''
<p/>What makes you behave so?'' said St. Clare, who could not help being amused with the child's expression. '' Spects it's my wicked heart,'' said Topsy, demurely; <div class="bookquote">``Miss Feely says so.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you see how much Miss Ophelia has done for you?

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) whipped me a heap harder, and used to pull my har, and knock my head agin the door; but it didn't do me no good!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lor, yes, Mas`r! old Missis used to say so, too. I spects, if they 's to pull every spire o' har out
<p/>o' my head, it wouldn't do no good, neither,--I 's so wicked! Laws! I 's nothin but a nigger, no ways!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I shall have to give her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) up,'' said Miss Ophelia; <div class="bookquote">``I can't have that trouble any longer.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, if your Gospel is not strong enough to save one heathen child, that you can have at home here, all to yourself, what's the use of sending one or two poor missionaries off with it among thousands of just such?
<p/>Well, I'd just like to ask one question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare. '' What is it?'' I suppose this child is about a fair sample of what thousands of your heathen are.
<p/>Miss Ophelia did not make an immediate answer; and Eva, who had stood a silent spectator of the scene thus far, made a silent sign to Topsy to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
<p/>There was a little glass-room at the corner of the verandah, which St. Clare used as a sort of reading-room; and Eva and Topsy disappeared into this place.
<p/>'' '' What's Eva going about, now?'' said St. Clare; <div class="bookquote">``I mean to see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>And, advancing on tiptoe, he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) lifted up a curtain that covered the glass-door, and looked in.
<p/>In a moment, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) lips, he (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) made a silent gesture to Miss Ophelia to come and look.
<p/>Topsy, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but, opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), Eva, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) large eyes.
<p/>There sat the two children on the floor, with their side faces towards them. '' What does make you so bad, Topsy?
<p/>Why won't you try and be good? Don't you love anybody , Topsy?'' <div class="bookquote">``Donno nothing `bout love; I loves candy and sich, that's all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said Topsy.
<p/>'' But you love your father and mother?'' '' Never had none, ye know. I telled ye that, Miss Eva.'' <div class="bookquote">``O, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, sadly; <div class="bookquote">``but hadn't you any brother, or sister, or aunt, or--''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, none on '
<p/>em,--never had nothing nor nobody.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>'' But, Topsy, if you'd only try to be good, you might--'' <div class="bookquote">``Couldn't never be nothin' but a nigger, if I was ever so good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said Topsy.
<p/>'' If I could be skinned, and come white, I'd try then.'' '' But people can love you, if you are black, Topsy.
<p/>Miss Ophelia would love you, if you were good. '' Topsy gave the short, blunt laugh that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) common mode of expressing incredulity.
<p/>'' Don't you think so?'' said Eva. '' No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) can't bar me, 'cause I'm a nigger!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)'d 's soon have a toad touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)!
<p/>O, Topsy, poor child, I love you!'' said Eva, with a sudden burst of feeling, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) little thin, white hand on Topsy's shoulder; <div class="bookquote">``I love you, because you haven't had any father, or mother, or friends;--because you've been a poor, abused child!
<p/>There can't nobody love niggers, and niggers can't do nothin'! I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said Topsy, beginning to whistle. '' I love you, and I want you to be good.
<p/>I am very unwell, Topsy, and I think I shan't live a great while; and it really grieves me, to have you be so naughty.
<p/>I wish you would try to be good, for my sake;--it's only a little while I shall be with you. ''
<p/>The round, keen eyes of the black child were overcast with tears;--large, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by one, and fell on the little white hand.
<p/>Yes, in that moment, a ray of real belief, a ray of heavenly love, had penetrated the darkness of her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) heathen soul!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) head down between her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) knees, and wept and sobbed,--while the beautiful child, bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), looked like the picture of some bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner.
<p/>'' Poor Topsy!'' said Eva, <div class="bookquote">``don't you know that Jesus loves all alike? He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) is just as willing to love you, as me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) will help you to be good; and you can go to Heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you were white.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) loves you just as I do,--only more, because he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) is better. Only think of it, Topsy!-- you can be one of those spirits bright, Uncle Tom sings about.''

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>St. Clare, at this instant, dropped the curtain. '' It puts me in mind of mother,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said to Miss Ophelia.
<p/>It is true what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) told me; if we want to give sight to the blind, we must be willing to do as Christ did,--call them to us, and put our hands on them .''

<p/>CHAPTER XXVI Death Weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb, In life's early morning, hath hid from our eyes.
<p/>Eva's bed-room was a spacious apartment, which, like all the other rooms in the house, opened on to the broad verandah.
<p/>The room communicated, on one side, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father and mother's apartment; on the other, with that appropriated to Miss Ophelia.
<p/>St. Clare had gratified his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own eye and taste, in furnishing this room in a style that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) for whom it was intended.
<p/>The windows were hung with curtains of rose-colored and white muslin, the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered in Paris, to a pattern of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own device, having round it a border of rose-buds and leaves, and a centre-piece with full-flown roses.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) might teach me a lesson.'' * * <div class="bookquote">``Weep Not for Those,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>a poem by Thomas Moore -LRB-1779-1852-RRB-. The bedstead, chairs, and lounges, were of bamboo, wrought in peculiarly graceful and fanciful patterns.
<p/>Over the head of the bed was an alabaster bracket, on which a beautiful sculptured angel stood, with drooping wings, holding out a crown of myrtle-leaves.
<p/>From this depended, over the bed, light curtains of rose-colored gauze, striped with silver, supplying that protection from mosquitos which is an indispensable addition to all sleeping accommodation in that climate.
<p/>The graceful bamboo lounges were amply supplied with cushions of rose-colored damask, while over them, depending from the hands of sculptured figures, were gauze
<p/>A light, fanciful bamboo table stood in the middle of the room, where a Parian vase, wrought in the shape of a white lily, with its buds, stood, ever filled with flowers.
<p/>On this table lay Eva's books and little trinkets, with an elegantly wrought alabaster writing-stand, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father had supplied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) trying to improve herself in writing.
<p/>There was a fireplace in the room, and on the marble mantle above stood a beautifully wrought statuette of Jesus receiving little children, and on either side marble vases, for which it was Tom's pride and delight to offer bouquets every morning.
<p/>curtains similar to those of the bed. Two or three exquisite paintings of children, in various attitudes, embellished the wall. In short, the eye could turn nowhere without meeting images of childhood, of beauty, and of peace.
<p/>Those little eyes never opened, in the morning light, without falling on something which suggested to the heart soothing and beautiful thoughts.
<p/>The deceitful strength which had buoyed Eva up for a little while was fast passing away; seldom and more seldom her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) light footstep was heard in the verandah, and oftener and oftener she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was found reclined on a little lounge by the open window, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) large, deep eyes fixed on the rising and falling waters of the lake.
<p/>It was towards the middle of the afternoon, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was so reclining,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) Bible half open, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) little transparent fingers lying listlessly between the
<p/>leaves,--suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mother's voice, in sharp tones, in the verandah. '' What now, you baggage!--what new piece of mischief!
<p/>You've been picking the flowers, hey? '' and Eva heard the sound of a smart slap. '' Law, Missis! they 's for Miss Eva,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) heard a voice say, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) knew belonged to Topsy.
<p/>'' Miss Eva! A pretty excuse!--you suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) wants your flowers, you good-for-nothing nigger! Get along off with you!'' In a moment, Eva was off from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) lounge, and in the verandah.
<p/>'' O, don't, mother! I should like the flowers; do give them to me; I want them!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, Eva, your room is full now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't have too many,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva. '' Topsy, do bring them here. '' Topsy, who had stood sullenly, holding down her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) head, now came up and offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) flowers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) did it with a look of hesitation and bashfulness, quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was usual with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
<p/>'' It's a beautiful bouquet!'' said Eva, looking at it. It was rather a singular one,--a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one single white japonica, with its glossy leaves.
<p/>It was tied up with an evident eye to the contrast of color, and the arrangement of every leaf had carefully been studied.
<p/>Topsy looked pleased, as Eva said,--<div class="bookquote">``Topsy, you arrange flowers very prettily. Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``is this vase I haven't any flowers for.
<p/>I wish you'd arrange something every day for it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Well, that's odd!'' said Marie. '' What in the world do you want that for?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, mamma; you'd as lief as not Topsy should do it,--had you not?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course, anything you please, dear! Topsy, you hear your young mistress;--see that you mind.
<p/>Topsy made a short courtesy, and looked down; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) turned away, Eva saw a tear roll down her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) dark cheek.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' You see, mamma, I knew poor Topsy wanted to do something for me,'' said Eva to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mother. ''
<p/>O, nonsense! it's only because she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) likes to do mischief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) mustn't pick flowers,--so she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) does it; that's all there is to it.
<p/>But, if you fancy to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) pluck them, so be it.'' '' Mamma, I think Topsy is different from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) used to be; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)'s trying to be a good girl.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)'ll have to try a good while before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) gets to be good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie, with a careless laugh. ''
<p/>Well, you know, mamma, poor Topsy! everything has always been against her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>).'' '' Not since she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s been here, I'm sure. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hasn't been talked to, and preached to, and every earthly thing done that anybody could
<p/>But, mamma, it's so different to be brought up as I've been, with so many friends, so many things to make me good and happy; and to be brought up as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s been, all the time, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) came here!''
<p/>do;--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s just so ugly, and always will be; you can't make anything of the creature!'' '' '' Most likely,'' said Marie, yawning,--<div class="bookquote">``dear me, how hot it is!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Mamma, you believe, don't you, that Topsy could become an angel, as well as any of us, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) were a Christian?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Topsy! what a ridiculous idea! Nobody but you would ever think of it. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could, though. ''  (<font color='red'><b>mamma</b></font>)</div>'' But, mamma, isn't God her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father, as much as ours?
<p/>Isn't Jesus her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) Saviour?'' '' Well, that may be. I suppose God made everybody,'' said Marie. '' Where is my smelling-bottle?''
<p/>'' It's such a pity,--oh! such a pity!'' said Eva, looking out on the distant lake, and speaking half to herself.
<p/>Why, that any one, who could be a bright angel, and live with angels, should go all down, down down, and nobody help them!--oh dear!''
<p/>'' What's a pity?'' said Marie. '' '' Well, we can't help it; it's no use worrying, Eva! I don't know what's to be done; we ought to be thankful for our own advantages.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I hardly can be,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, <div class="bookquote">``I'm so sorry to think of poor folks that haven't any.''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>'' That's odd enough,'' said Marie;--<div class="bookquote">``I'm sure my religion makes me thankful for my advantages.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mamma,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, <div class="bookquote">``I want to have some of my hair cut off,--a good deal of it.

<p/>'' Mamma, I want to give some away to my friends, while I am able to give it to them myself.
<p/>Won't you ask aunty to come and cut it for me?'' Marie raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) voice, and called Miss Ophelia, from the other room.
<p/>The child half rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) pillow as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) came in, and, shaking down her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) long golden-brown curls, said, rather playfully, <div class="bookquote">``Come aunty, shear the sheep!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What's that?'' said St. Clare, who just then entered with some fruit he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had been out to get for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).
<p/>Papa, I just want aunty to cut off some of my hair;--there's too much of it, and it makes my head hot.
<p/>'' Besides, I want to give some of it away. '' Miss Ophelia came, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) scissors. '' Take care,--don't spoil the looks of it!'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``cut underneath, where it won't show.
<p/>Yes, and I want them kept handsome against the time I take you up to your uncle's plantation, to see Cousin Henrique,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, in a gay tone.
<p/>Eva's curls are my pride. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, papa!''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, sadly. '' '' I shall never go there, papa;--I am going to a better country.
<p/>O, do believe me! Don't you see, papa, that I get weaker, every day?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why do you insist that I shall believe such a cruel thing, Eva?''  (<font color='red'><b>thing father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father.
<p/>Only because it is true , papa: and, if you will believe it now, perhaps you will get to feel about it as I do.
<p/>St. Clare closed his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) lips, and stood gloomily eying the long, beautiful curls, which, as they were separated from the child's head, were laid, one by one, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lap.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) raised them up, looked earnestly at them, twined them around her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thin fingers, and looked from time to time, anxiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) father.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``it's just what has been preying on my health, from day to day, bringing me downward to the grave, though nobody regards it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' It's just what I've been foreboding!'' said Marie; I have seen this, long. St. Clare, you will see, after a while, that I was right.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Which will afford you great consolation, no doubt!''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, in a dry, bitter tone. Marie lay back on a lounge, and covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) cambric handkerchief.
<p/>It was the calm, comprehending gaze of a soul half loosed from its earthly bonds; it was evident she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) saw, felt, and appreciated, the difference between the two.
<p/>Eva's clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) beckoned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came and sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>). ''
<p/>Papa, my strength fades away every day, and I know I must go. There are some things I want to say
<p/>and do,--that I ought to do; and you are so unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject. But it must come; there's no putting it off.
<p/>My child, I am willing!'' said St. Clare, covering his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) eyes with one hand, and holding up Eva's hand with the other.
<p/>Do be willing I should speak now!'' '' '' Then, I want to see all our people together. I have some things I must say to them,'' said Eva.
<p/>'' Well ,'' said St. Clare, in a tone of dry endurance. Miss Ophelia despatched a messenger, and soon the whole of the servants were convened in the room.
<p/>Eva lay back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) pillows; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) hair hanging loosely about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) crimson cheeks contrasting painfully with the intense whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) complexion and the thin contour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) limbs and features, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) large, soul-like eyes fixed earnestly on every one.
<p/>The spiritual face, the long locks of hair cut off and lying by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father's averted face, and Marie's sobs, struck at once upon the feelings of a sensitive and impressible race; and, as they came in, they looked one on another, sighed, and shook their heads.
<p/>The servants were struck with a sudden emotion. There was a deep silence, like that of a funeral. Eva raised herself, and looked long and earnestly round at every one.
<p/>All looked sad and apprehensive. Many of the women hid their faces in their aprons. '' I sent for you all, my dear friends,'' said Eva, ``because I love you.
<p/>I love you all; and I have something to say to you, which I want you always to remember... .
<p/>Here the child was interrupted by bursts of groans, sobs, and lamentations, which broke from all present, and in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) slender voice was lost entirely.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) waited a moment, and then, speaking in a tone that checked the sobs of all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``If you love me, you must not interrupt me so.
<p/>I am going to leave you. In a few more weeks you will see me no more--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Listen to what I say.
<p/>I want to speak to you about your souls... . Many of you, I am afraid, are very careless.
<p/>You are thinking only about this world. I want you to remember that there is a beautiful world, where Jesus is.
<p/>I am going there, and you can go there. It is for you, as much as me. But, if you want to go there, you must not live idle, careless, thoughtless lives.
<p/>You must be Christians. You must remember that each one of you can become angels, and be angels forever... .
<p/>If you want to be Christians, Jesus will help you. You must pray to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>); you must read--'' The child checked herself, looked piteously at them, and said, sorrowfully, <div class="bookquote">``O dear!
<p/>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) face in the pillow and sobbed, while many a smothered sob from those she (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was addressing, who were kneeling on the floor, aroused her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>).
<p/>Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>The child</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) said, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) face and smiling brightly through her (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) tears, <div class="bookquote">``I have prayed for you; and I know Jesus will help you, even if you can't read.
<p/>Try all to do the best you can; pray every day; ask Him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) to help you, and get the Bible read to you whenever you can; and I think I shall see you all in heaven.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>was the murmured response from the lips of Tom and Mammy, and some of the elder ones, who belonged to the Methodist church.
<p/>you can't read--poor souls!'' '' The younger and more thoughtless ones, for the time completely overcome, were sobbing, with their heads bowed upon their knees.
<p/>'' I know,'' said Eva, <div class="bookquote">``you all love me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>'' Yes; oh, yes! indeed we do! Lord bless her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)! '' was the involuntary answer of all.
<p/>There isn't one of you that hasn't always been very kind to me; and I want to give you something that, when you look at, you shall always remember me, I'm going to give all of you a curl of my hair; and, when you look at it, think that I loved you and am gone to heaven, and that I want to see you all there.
<p/>It is impossible to describe the scene, as, with tears and sobs, they gathered round the little creature, and took from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hands what seemed to them a last mark of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) love.
<p/>They fell on their knees; they sobbed, and prayed, and kissed the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) garment; and the elder ones poured forth words of endearment, mingled in prayers and blessings, after the manner of their susceptible race.
<p/>As each one took their gift, Miss Ophelia, who was apprehensive for the effect of all this excitement on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) little patient, signed to each one to pass out of the apartment.
<p/>'' Yes, I know you do! '' At last, all were gone but Tom and Mammy. '' Here, Uncle Tom,'' said Eva, <div class="bookquote">``is a beautiful one for you.
<p/>O, I am so happy, Uncle Tom , to think I shall see you in heaven,--for I'm sure I shall; and Mammy,--dear, good, kind Mammy!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, fondly throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) old nurse,--<div class="bookquote">``I know you'll be there, too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>nurse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, Miss Eva, don't see how I can live without ye, no how!''  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>said the faithful creature.
<p/>'' `Pears like it's just taking everything off the place to oncet!'' and Mammy gave way to a passion of grief.
<p/>Miss Ophelia pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) and Tom gently from the apartment, and thought they were all gone; but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) turned, Topsy was standing there.
<p/>'' Where did you start up from? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said, suddenly. '' I was here,'' said Topsy, wiping the tears from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' O, Miss Eva, I've been a bad girl; but won't you give me one, too?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, poor Topsy! to be sure, I will.
<p/>There--every time you look at that, think that I love you, and wanted you to be a good girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, Miss Eva, I is tryin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said Topsy, earnestly; <div class="bookquote">``but, Lor, it's so hard to be good! '
<p/>Pears like I an't used to it, no ways!''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jesus knows it, Topsy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) is sorry for you; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) will help you.
<p/>Topsy, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes hid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) apron, was silently passed from the apartment by Miss Ophelia; but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) went, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) hid the precious curl in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) bosom.
<p/>That worthy lady had wiped away many tears of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own, during the scene; but concern for the consequence of such an excitement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) young charge was uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) mind.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>All being gone, Miss Ophelia shut the door. St. Clare had been sitting, during the whole time, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) hand shading his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) eyes, in the same attitude.
<p/>When they were all gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) sat so still. <div class="bookquote">``Papa! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva, gently, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) gave a sudden start and shiver; but made no answer.
<p/>'' Dear papa!'' said Eva. '' I cannot ,'' said St. Clare, rising, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot have it so! The Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>and St. Clare pronounced these words with a bitter emphasis, indeed.
<p/>Perhaps so; but that doesn't make it any easier to bear,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>), with a dry, hard, tearless manner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) turned away.
<p/>'' Augustine! has not God a right to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own?'' said Miss Ophelia. '' '' Papa, you break my heart!'' said Eva, rising and throwing herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arms; <div class="bookquote">``you must not feel so!
<p/>and the child sobbed and wept with a violence which alarmed them all, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father's thoughts at once to another channel.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>'' There, Eva,--there, dearest! Hush! hush! I was wrong; I was wicked. I will feel any way, do any way,--only don't distress yourself; don't sob so.
<p/>Eva soon lay like a wearied dove in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father's arms; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), soothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) by every tender word he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could think of.
<p/>I will be resigned; I was wicked to speak as I did. '' Marie rose and threw herself out of the apartment into her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) fell into violent hysterics.
<p/>They are all yours, papa,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), smiling--<div class="bookquote">``yours and mamma's; and you must give dear aunty as many as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) wants.

<p/>. . You are a Christian, are you not, papa?'' said Eva, doubtfully. '' Why do you ask me?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.
<p/>You are so good , I don't see how you can help it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Christian Eva</b></font>)</div>'' What is being a Christian, Eva?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Loving Christ most of all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eva/Miss Eva</b></font>)</div>said Eva. '' Do you, Eva?'' <div class="bookquote">``Certainly I do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare.
<p/>I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), and in a few days I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>);'' and the young face grew fervent, radiant with joy.
<p/>'' That makes no difference,'' said Eva. '' St. Clare said no more. It was a feeling which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had seen before in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) mother; but no chord within vibrated to it.
<p/>Eva, after this, declined rapidly; there was no more any doubt of the event; the fondest hope could not be blinded.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) beautiful room was avowedly a sick room; and Miss Ophelia day and night performed the duties of a nurse,--and never did her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) friends appreciate her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) value more than in that capacity.
<p/>With so well-trained a hand and eye, such perfect adroitness and practice in every art which could promote neatness and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of sickness,--with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear, untroubled head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and direction of the doctors,--she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was everything to him (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>).
<p/>They who had shrugged their shoulders at her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) little peculiarities and setnesses, so unlike the careless freedom of southern manners, acknowledged that now she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was the exact person that was wanted.
<p/>The child suffered much from nervous restlessness, and it was a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) to be carried; and it was Tom's greatest delight to carry her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) little frail form in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arms, resting on a pillow, now up and down her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) room, now out into the verandah; and when the fresh sea-breezes blew from the lake,--and
<p/>the child felt freshest in the morning,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would sometimes walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) under the orange-trees in the garden, or, sitting down in some of their old seats, sing to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) their favorite old hymns.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) father often did the same thing; but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) frame was slighter, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was weary, Eva would say to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``O, papa, let Tom take me.
<p/>Uncle Tom was much in Eva's room. Poor fellow! it pleases him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and you know it's all he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can do now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wants to do something!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' So do I, Eva!'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father. '' Well, papa, you can do everything, and are everything to me. You read to me,--you sit up nights,--and
<p/>Tom has only this one thing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) singing; and I know, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) does it easier than you can. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) carries me so strong!''
<p/>The desire to do something was not confined to Tom. Every servant in the establishment showed the same feeling, and in their way did what they could.
<p/>Poor Mammy's heart yearned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) darling; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) found no opportunity, night or day, as Marie declared that the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) mind was such, it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) to rest; and, of course, it was against her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) principles to let any one else rest.
<p/>Twenty times in a night, Mammy would be roused to rub her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) feet, to bathe her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head, to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief, to see what the noise was in Eva's room, to let down a curtain because it was too light, or to put it up because it was too dark; and, in the daytime, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) longed to have some share in the nursing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) pet, Marie seemed unusually ingenious in keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) busy anywhere and everywhere all over the house, or about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own person; so that stolen interviews and momentary glimpses were all she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) could obtain.
<p/>I feel it my duty to be particularly careful of myself, now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``feeble as I am, and with the whole care and nursing of that dear child upon me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You talk like a man, St. Clare,--just as if a mother could be relieved of the care of a child in that state; but, then, it's all alike,--no one ever knows what I feel!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' Indeed, my dear,'' said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``I thought our cousin relieved you of that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>I can't throw things off, as you do.
<p/>For so bright and placid was the farewell voyage of the little spirit,--by such sweet and fragrant breezes was the small bark borne towards the heavenly

<p/>The child felt no pain,--only a tranquil, soft weakness, daily and almost insensibly increasing; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was so beautiful, so loving, so trustful, so happy, that one could not resist the soothing influence of that air of innocence and peace which seemed to breathe around her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).
<p/>It was not hope,--that was impossible; it was not resignation; it was only a calm resting in the present, which seemed so beautiful that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wished to think of no future.
<p/>It was like that hush of spirit which we feel amid the bright, mild woods of autumn, when the bright hectic flush is on the trees, and the last lingering flowers by the brook; and we joy in it all the more, because we know that soon it will all pass away.
<p/>St. Clare found a strange calm coming over him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). The friend who knew most of Eva's own imaginings and foreshadowings was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) faithful bearer, Tom.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) imparted those mysterious intimations which the soul feels, as the cords begin to unbind, ere it leaves its clay forever.
<p/>Tom, at last, would not sleep in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) room, but lay all night in the outer verandah, ready to rouse at every call.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) would not disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father by saying. '' Uncle Tom, what alive have you taken to sleeping anywhere and everywhere, like a dog, for?'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>'' I thought you was one of the orderly sort, that liked to lie in bed in a Christian way. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do, Miss Feely,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, mysteriously. '' I do, but now-- '' '' Well, what now?'' '' We mustn't speak loud;
<p/>Mas'r St. Clare won't hear on `t; but Miss Feely, you know there must be somebody watchin' for the bridegroom. ''
<p/>'' What do you mean, Tom?'' <div class="bookquote">``You know it says in Scripture, `At midnight there was a great cry made. Behold, the bridegroom cometh.'
<p/>That's what I'm spectin now, every night, Miss Feely,--and I couldn't sleep out o' hearin, no ways.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, Uncle Tom, what makes you think so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I must be thar, Miss Feely; for when that ar blessed child goes into the kingdom, they'll open the door so wide, we'll all get a look in at the glory, Miss Feely.''
<p/>``Miss Eva, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) talks to me. The Lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) sends his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) messenger in the soul. <div class="bookquote">``Uncle Tom, did Miss Eva say she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) felt more unwell than usual tonight?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) telled me, this morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was coming nearer,--thar's them that tells it to the child, Miss Feely.
<p/>This dialogue passed between Miss Ophelia and Tom, between ten and eleven, one evening, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) arrangements had all been made for the night, when, on going to bolt her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) outer door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) found Tom stretched along by it, in the outer verandah.
<p/>It's the angels,--`it's the trumpet sound afore the break o' day,''' said Tom, quoting from a favorite hymn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was not nervous or impressible; but the solemn, heart-felt manner struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).
<p/>Eva had been unusually bright and cheerful, that afternoon, and had sat raised in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) bed, and looked over all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) little trinkets and precious things, and designated the friends to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) would have them given; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) manner was more animated, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) voice more natural, than they had known it for weeks.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father had been in, in the evening, and had said that Eva appeared more like her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) former self than ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had done since her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) sickness; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) for the night, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said to Miss Ophelia,--<div class="bookquote">``Cousin, we may keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) with us, after all; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) is certainly better;''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) had retired with a lighter heart in his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) bosom than he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) had had there for weeks.
<p/>But at midnight,--strange, mystic hour!--when the veil between the frail present and the eternal future grows thin,--then came the messenger! There was a sound in that chamber, first of one who stepped quickly.
<p/>It was Miss Ophelia, who had resolved to sit up all night with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) little charge, and who, at the turn of the night, had discerned what experienced nurses significantly call <div class="bookquote">``a change.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>nurses</b></font>)</div>The outer door was quickly opened, and Tom, who was watching outside, was on the alert, in a moment. ''
<p/>Go for the doctor, Tom! lose not a moment,'' said Miss Ophelia; and, stepping across the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) rapped at St. Clare's door.
<p/>'' Cousin,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you would come. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Those words fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) heart like clods upon a coffin.
<p/>Why did they? He (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) was up and in the room in an instant, and bending over Eva, who still slept. What was it
<p/>Thou canst say, who hast seen that same expression on the face dearest to thee;--that look indescribable, hopeless, unmistakable, that says to thee that thy beloved is no longer thine.
<p/>On the face of the child, however, there was no ghastly imprint,--only a high and almost sublime expression,--the overshadowing presence of spiritual natures, the dawning of immortal life in that childish soul.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>dearest</b></font>) saw that made his (<font color='blue'><b>dearest</b></font>) heart stand still? Why was no word spoken between the two? They stood there so still, gazing upon her (<font color='blue'><b>dearest</b></font>), that even the ticking of the watch seemed too loud.
<p/>In a few moments, Tom returned, with the doctor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) entered, gave one look, and stood silent as the rest. ''
<p/>When did this change take place? '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), in a low whisper, to Miss Ophelia. '' About the turn of the night,'' was the reply.
<p/>Marie, roused by the entrance of the doctor, appeared, hurriedly, from the next room. '' Augustine! Cousin!--O!--what! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) hurriedly began.
<p/>The house was soon roused,--lights were seen, footsteps heard, anxious faces thronged the verandah, and looked tearfully through the glass doors; but St. Clare heard and said nothing,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) saw only that look on the face of the little sleeper.
<p/>'' Hush!'' said St. Clare, hoarsely; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is dying! ''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>Mammy heard the words, and flew to awaken the servants. ''
<p/>O, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would only wake, and speak once more! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) said; and, stooping over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) spoke in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ear,--<div class="bookquote">``Eva, darling!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The large blue eyes unclosed--a smile passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) face;--she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) tried to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) head, and to speak. '' Do you know me, Eva?''
<p/>In a moment they dropped again; and, as St. Clare raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) saw a spasm of mortal agony pass over the face,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) struggled for breath, and threw up her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) little hands.
<p/>'' Dear papa,'' said the child, with a last effort, throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arms about his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) neck. '' O, God, this is dreadful!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, turning away in agony, and wringing Tom's hand, scarce conscious what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was doing. '' O, Tom, my boy, it is killing me!''
<p/>Tom had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master's hands between his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own; and, with tears streaming down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dark cheeks, looked up for help where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had always been used to look.
<p/>'' Pray that this may be cut short!'' said St. Clare,--<div class="bookquote">``this wrings my heart. ''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, bless the Lord! it's over,--it's over, dear Master!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>The child lay panting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) pillows, as one exhausted,--the large clear eyes rolled up and fixed.
<p/>Earth was past,--and earthly pain; but so solemn, so mysterious, was the triumphant brightness of that face, that it checked even the sobs of sorrow.
<p/>Ah, what said those eyes, that spoke so much of heaven! They pressed around her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>), in breathless stillness. '' Eva,'' said St. Clare, gently.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) did not hear. '' O, Eva, tell us what you see! What is it?'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) father. A bright, a glorious smile passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) face, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said, brokenly,--<div class="bookquote">``O!
<p/>love,--joy,--peace! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>gave one sigh and passed from death unto life! <div class="bookquote">``Farewell, beloved child! the bright, eternal doors have closed after thee; we shall see thy sweet face no more.
<p/>O, woe for them who watched thy entrance into heaven, when they shall wake and find only the cold gray sky of daily life, and thou gone forever!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XXVII '' This Is the Last of Earth ''* * '' This is the last of Earth! I am content,'' last words of John Quincy Adams, uttered February 21, 1848.
<p/>The statuettes and pictures in Eva's room were shrouded in white napkins, and only hushed breathings and muffled footfalls were heard there, and the light stole in solemnly through windows partially darkened by closed blinds.
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) lay, robed in one of the simple white dresses she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had been wont to wear when living; the rose-colored light through the curtains cast over the icy coldness of death a warm glow.
<p/>The heavy eyelashes drooped softly on the pure cheek; the head was turned a little to one side, as if in natural sleep, but there was diffused over every lineament of the face that high celestial expression, that mingling of rapture and repose, which showed it was no earthly or temporary sleep, but the long, sacred rest which <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) giveth to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) beloved.
<p/>The bed was draped in white; and there, beneath the drooping angel-figure, lay a little sleeping form,--sleeping never to waken! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>neither darkness nor shadow of death; only such a bright fading as when the morning star fades in the golden dawn.
<p/>There is no death to such as thou, dear Eva! Thine is the victory without the battle,--the crown without the conflict.
<p/>So did St. Clare think, as, with folded arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stood there gazing. Ah! who shall say what he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did think?
<p/>for, from the hour that voices had said, in the dying chamber, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) is gone,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it had been all a dreary mist, a heavy <div class="bookquote">``dimness of anguish.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had heard voices around him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had had questions asked, and answered them; they had asked him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would have the funeral, and where they should lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had answered, impatiently, that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cared not.
<p/>Adolph and Rosa had arranged the chamber; volatile, fickle and childish, as they generally were, they were soft-hearted and full of feeling; and, while Miss Ophelia presided over the general details of order and neatness, it was their hands that added those soft, poetic touches to the arrangements,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>that took from the death-room the grim and ghastly air which too often marks a New England funeral. There were still flowers on the shelves,--all white, delicate and fragrant, with graceful, drooping leaves.
<p/>The folds of the drapery, the fall of the curtains, had been arranged and rearranged, by Adolph and Rosa, with that nicety of eye which characterizes their race.
<p/>Even now, while St. Clare stood there thinking, little Rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a basket of white flowers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) stepped back when she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) saw St. Clare, and stopped respectfully; but, seeing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) did not observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) came forward to place them around the dead.
<p/>St. Clare saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) as in a dream, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) placed in the small hands a fair cape jessamine, and, with admirable taste, disposed other flowers around the couch.
<p/>Eva's little table, covered with white, bore on it her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) favorite vase, with a single white moss rose-bud in it. The door opened again, and Topsy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes swelled with crying, appeared, holding something under her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) apron.
<p/>Rosa made a quick forbidding gesture; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) took a step into the room. '' You must go out,'' said Rosa, in a sharp, positive whisper; '' you haven't any business here!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, do let me! I brought a flower,--such a pretty one!''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said Topsy, holding up a half-blown tea rose-bud. '' Do let me put just one there.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get along!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa/Miss Rosa</b></font>)</div>said Rosa, more decidedly. <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) stay!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, suddenly stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) foot. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) shall come. ''
<p/>Rosa suddenly retreated, and Topsy came forward and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) offering at the feet of the corpse; then suddenly, with a wild and bitter cry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) threw herself on the floor alongside the bed, and wept, and moaned aloud.
<p/>Miss Ophelia hastened into the room, and tried to raise and silence her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>); but in vain. '' O, Miss Eva! oh, Miss Eva!
<p/>There was a piercing wildness in the cry; the blood flushed into St. Clare's white, marble-like face, and the first tears he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had shed since Eva died stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>I wish I 's dead, too,--I do! '' '' Get up, child,'' said Miss Ophelia, in a softened voice; <div class="bookquote">``don't cry so.
<p/>Miss Eva is gone to heaven; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) is an angel.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>'' But I can't see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)!'' said Topsy. '' I never shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>)!'' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) sobbed again.
<p/>They all stood a moment in silence. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) loved me,'' said Topsy,--<div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) did! O, dear! oh, dear! there
<p/>That's true enough''  (<font color='red'><b>Topsy</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare; <div class="bookquote">``but do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) said to Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``see if you can't comfort the poor creature.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><p/>an't nobody left now,--there an't!'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I jist wish I hadn't never been born,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Topsy. '' I didn't want to be born, no ways; and I don't see no use on `t.
<p/>Miss Ophelia raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) gently, but firmly, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) from the room; but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) did so, some tears fell from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' '' Topsy, you poor child,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) room, <div class="bookquote">``don't give up! I can love you, though I am not like that dear little child.
<p/>I hope I've learnt something of the love of Christ from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>). I can love you; I do, and I'll try to help you to grow up a good Christian girl.
<p/>Miss Ophelia's voice was more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) words, and more than that were the honest tears that fell down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) face.
<p/>O, my Eva, whose little hour on earth did so much of good,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>thought St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``what account have I to give for my long years?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>From that hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) acquired an influence over the mind of the destitute child that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) never lost. '' ''
<p/>There were, for a while, soft whisperings and footfalls in the chamber, as one after another stole in, to look at the dead; and then came the little coffin; and then there was a funeral, and carriages drove to the door, and strangers came and were seated; and there were white scarfs and ribbons, and crape bands, and mourners dressed in black crape; and there were words read from the Bible, and
<p/>prayers offered; and St. Clare lived, and walked, and moved, as one who has shed every tear;--to the last he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) saw only one thing, that golden head in the coffin; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) saw the cloth spread over it, the lid of the coffin closed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) walked, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was put beside the others, down to a little place at the bottom of the garden, and there, by the mossy seat where she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) and Tom had talked, and sung, and read so often, was the little grave.
<p/>St. Clare stood beside it,--looked vacantly down; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw them lower the little coffin; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard, dimly, the solemn words, <div class="bookquote">``I am the resurrection and the Life; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that believeth in me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) were dead, yet shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) live;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and, as the earth was cast in and filled up the little grave, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could not realize that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Eva that they were hiding from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sight.
<p/>Nor was it!--not Eva, but only the frail seed of that bright, immortal form with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) shall yet come forth, in the day of the Lord Jesus!
<p/>And then all were gone, and the mourners went back to the place which should know her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) no more; and Marie's room was darkened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) lay on the bed, sobbing and moaning in uncontrollable grief, and calling every moment for the attentions of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) servants.
<p/>the grief was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) grief, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was fully convinced that nobody on earth did, could, or would feel it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) did.
<p/>St. Clare did not shed a tear,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) didn't sympathize with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>); it was perfectly wonderful to think how hard-hearted and unfeeling he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) must know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) suffered.
<p/>So much are people the slave of their eye and ear, that many of the servants really thought that Missis was the principal sufferer in the case, especially as Marie began to have hysterical spasms, and sent for the doctor, and at last declared herself dying; and, in the running and scampering, and bringing up hot bottles, and heating of flannels, and chafing, and fussing, that ensued, there was quite a diversion.
<p/>Of course, they had no time to cry,--why should they? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Tom, however, had a feeling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own heart, that drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked, wistfully and sadly; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sitting, so pale and quiet, in Eva's room, holding before his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) little open Bible, though seeing no letter or word of what was in it, there was more sorrow to Tom in that still, fixed, tearless eye, than in all Marie's moans and lamentations.
<p/>In a few days the St. Clare family were back again in the city; Augustine, with the restlessness of grief, longing for another scene, to change the current of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>So they left the house and garden, with its little grave, and came back to New Orleans; and St. Clare walked the streets busily, and strove to fill up the chasm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart with hurry and bustle, and change of place; and people who saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the street, or met him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) at the cafe, knew of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) loss only by the weed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hat; for there he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was, smiling and talking, and reading the newspaper, and speculating on politics, and attending to business matters; and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre?
<p/>I used to think, if there was anything in the world he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did love, it was our dear little Eva; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seems to be forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) very easily.
<p/>'' Mr. St. Clare is a singular man,'' said Marie to Miss Ophelia, in a complaining tone. '' I cannot ever get him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) to talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>).
<p/>I really did think he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) would show more feeling!'' <div class="bookquote">``Still waters run deepest, they used to tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, oracularly.
<p/>'' O, I don't believe in such things; it's all talk. If people have feeling, they will show it,--they can't help it; but, then, it's a great misfortune to have feeling.
<p/>I'd rather have been made like St. Clare. My feelings prey upon me so!'' <div class="bookquote">``Sure, Missis, Mas'r St. Clare is gettin' thin as a shader.
<p/>They say, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) don't never eat nothin',''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mammy. '' I know he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) don't forget Miss Eva; I know there couldn't nobody,--dear, little, blessed cretur!
<p/>Well, at all events, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) has no consideration for me,'' said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hasn't spoken one word of sympathy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) must know how much more a mother feels than any man can.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) added, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes. '' '' The heart knoweth its own bitterness,'' said Miss Ophelia, gravely. '' That's just what I think.
<p/>I know just what I feel,--nobody else seems to. Eva used to, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) is gone!'' and Marie lay back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lounge, and began to sob disconsolately.
<p/>Marie was one of those unfortunately constituted mortals, in whose eyes whatever is lost and gone assumes a value which it never had in possession.
<p/>Whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) seemed to survey only to pick flaws in it; but, once fairly away, there was no end to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) valuation of it.
<p/>Tom, who was always uneasily following his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master about, had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) go to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) library, some hours before; and, after vainly waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to come out, determined, at last, to make an errand in.
<p/>While this conversation was taking place in the parlor another was going on in St. Clare's library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) entered softly. St. Clare lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lounge, at the further end of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face, with Eva's Bible open before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), at a little distance. Tom walked up, and stood by the sofa.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hesitated; and, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was hesitating, St. Clare suddenly raised himself up. The honest face, so full of grief, and with such an imploring expression of affection and sympathy, struck his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand on Tom's, and bowed down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forehead on it. '' O, Tom, my boy, the whole world is as empty as an egg-shell.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I know it, Mas`r,--I know it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``but, oh, if Mas'r could only look up,--up where our dear Miss Eva is,--up to the dear Lord Jesus!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Ah, Tom! I do look up; but the trouble is, I don't see anything, when I do, I wish I could.
<p/>It seems to be given to children, and poor, honest fellows, like you, to see what we can't,'' said St. Clare.
<p/>Thou has `hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes,''' murmured Tom; ''`even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.'''
<p/>'' Tom sighed heavily. '' '' How comes it?'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Tom, I don't believe,--I can't believe,--I've got the habit of doubting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare.
<p/>'' I want to believe this Bible,--and I can't. '' '' Dear Mas`r, pray to the good Lord,--`Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief.'''
<p/>``Was all that beautiful love and faith only one of the ever-shifting phases of human feeling, having nothing real to rest on, passing away with the little breath?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who knows anything about anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) eyes wandering dreamily, and speaking to himself. And is there no more Eva,--no heaven,--no Christ,--nothing?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, dear Mas`r, there is! I know it; I'm sure of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, falling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees. '' Do, do, dear Mas`r, believe it!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you know there's any Christ, Tom! You never saw the Lord.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Felt Him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in my soul, Mas`r,--feel Him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) now!
<p/>O, Mas`r, when I was sold away from my old woman and the children, I was jest a`most broke up. I felt as if there warn't
<p/>nothin' left; and then the good Lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) stood by me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) says, `Fear not, Tom;' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brings light and joy in a poor feller's soul,--makes all peace; and I 's so happy, and loves everybody, and feels willin' jest to be the Lord's, and have the Lord's will done, and be put jest where the Lord wants to put me.
<p/>I know it couldn't come from me, cause I 's a poor, complainin' cretur; it comes from the Lord; and I know He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s willin' to do for Mas`r.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Tom spoke with fast-running tears and choking voice. St. Clare leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulder, and wrung the hard, faithful, black hand.
<p/>'' Tom, you love me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said. '' I 's willin' to lay down my life, this blessed day, to see Mas'r a Christian.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Poor, foolish boy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, half-raising himself. '' I'm not worth the love of one good, honest heart, like yours.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Mas`r, dere's more than me loves you,--the blessed Lord Jesus loves you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How do you know that Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Singular!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, turning away, <div class="bookquote">``that the story of a man that lived and died eighteen hundred years ago can affect people so yet.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>Feels it in my soul. O, Mas`r! ' the love of Christ, that passeth knowledge.''' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was no man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) added, suddenly.
<p/>'' No man ever had such long and living power! O, that I could believe what my mother taught me, and pray as I did when I was a boy!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If Mas'r pleases,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Eva used to read this so beautifully. I wish Mas`r'd be so good as read it.
<p/>Don't get no readin', hardly, now Miss Eva's gone. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>The chapter was the eleventh of John,--the touching account of the raising of Lazarus,
<p/>St. Clare read it aloud, often pausing to wrestle down feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story. Tom knelt before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), with clasped hands, and with an absorbed expression of love, trust, adoration, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) quiet face.
<p/>'' Tom,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Master, <div class="bookquote">``this is all real to you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can jest fairly see it Mas`r,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom. ''
<p/>But, Tom, you know that I have a great deal more knowledge than you; what if I should tell you that I don't believe this Bible?''
<p/>I wish I had your eyes, Tom.'' <div class="bookquote">``I wish, to the dear Lord, Mas'r had!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' O, Mas`r!'' said Tom, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands, with a deprecating gesture.
<p/>'' Wouldn't it shake your faith some, Tom?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not a grain,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom. '' Why, Tom, you must know I know the most.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, Mas`r, haven't you jest read how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hides from the wise and prudent, and reveals unto babes? But Mas'r wasn't in earnest, for sartin, now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, anxiously.
<p/>'' No, Tom, I was not. I don't disbelieve, and I think there is reason to believe; and still I don't.
<p/>It's a troublesome bad habit I've got, Tom.'' '' If Mas'r would only pray!'' <div class="bookquote">``How do you know I don't, Tom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Does Mas`r?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I would, Tom, if there was anybody there when I pray; but it's all speaking unto nothing, when I do.
<p/>But come, Tom, you pray now, and show me how. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Tom's heart was full; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) poured it out in prayer, like waters that have been long suppressed.
<p/>In fact, St. Clare felt himself borne, on the tide of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) faith and feeling, almost to the gates of that heaven he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seemed so vividly to conceive.
<p/>One thing was plain enough; Tom thought there was somebody to hear, whether there were or not. It seemed to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nearer to Eva.
<p/>'' Thank you, my boy,'' said St. Clare, when Tom rose. '' I like to hear you, Tom; but go, now, and leave me alone;
<p/>CHAPTER XXVIII Reunion Week after week glided away in the St. Clare mansion, and the waves of life settled back to their usual flow, where that little bark had gone down.
<p/>For how imperiously, how coolly, in disregard of all one's feeling, does the hard, cold, uninteresting course of daily realities move on!
<p/>Still must we eat, and drink, and sleep, and wake again,--still bargain, buy, sell, ask and answer questions,--pursue, in short, a thousand shadows, though all interest in them be over; the cold mechanical habit of living remaining, after all vital interest in it has fled.
<p/>some other time, I'll talk more. '' Tom silently left the room. All the interests and hopes of St. Clare's life had unconsciously wound themselves around this child.
<p/>It was for Eva that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had managed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) property; it was for Eva that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had planned the disposal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) time; and, to do this and that for Eva,--to buy, improve, alter, and arrange, or dispose something for
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>),--had been so long his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) habit, that now she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was gone, there seemed nothing to be thought of, and nothing to be done.
<p/>True, there was another life,--a life which, once believed in, stands as a solemn, significant figure before the otherwise unmeaning ciphers of time, changing them to orders of mysterious, untold value.
<p/>St. Clare knew this well; and often, in many a weary hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard that slender, childish voice calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the skies, and saw that little hand pointing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) the way of life; but a heavy lethargy of sorrow lay on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could not arise.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had one of those natures which could better and more clearly conceive of religious things from its own perceptions and instincts, than many a matter-of-fact and practical Christian.
<p/>The gift to appreciate and the sense to feel the finer shades and relations of moral things, often seems an attribute of those whose whole life shows a careless disregard of them.
<p/>Hence Moore, Byron, Goethe, often speak words more wisely descriptive of the true religious sentiment, than another man, whose whole life is governed by it.
<p/>St. Clare had never pretended to govern himself by any religious obligation; and a certain fineness of nature gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) such an instinctive view of the extent of the requirements of Christianity, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shrank, by anticipation, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt would be the exactions of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own conscience, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once did resolve to assume them.
<p/>For, so inconsistent is human nature, especially in the ideal, that not to undertake a thing at all seems better than to undertake and come short.
<p/>In such minds, disregard of religion is a more fearful treason,--a more deadly sin. Still St. Clare was, in many respects, another man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little Eva's Bible seriously and honestly; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought more soberly and practically of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relations to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) servants,--enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extremely dissatisfied with both his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) past and present course; and one thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return to New Orleans, and that was to commence the legal steps necessary to Tom's emancipation, which was to be perfected as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could get through the necessary formalities.
<p/>In all the wide world, there was nothing that seemed to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) so much of Eva; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would insist on keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) constantly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and, fastidious and unapproachable as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was with regard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) deeper feelings, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) almost thought aloud to Tom.
<p/>Nor would any one have wondered at it, who had seen the expression of affection and devotion with which Tom continually followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) young master.
<p/>Well, Tom,'' said St. Clare, the day after he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had commenced the legal formalities for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) enfranchisement, ``I'm going to make a free man of you;--so have your trunk packed, and get ready to set out for Kentuck.
<p/>The sudden light of joy that shone in Tom's face as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands to heaven, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) emphatic <div class="bookquote">``Bless the Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rather discomposed St. Clare; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) did not like it that Tom should be so ready to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>Meantime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) attached himself to Tom more and more, every day. '' '' '' You haven't had such very bad times here, that you need be in such a rapture, Tom,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said drily.
<p/>'' No, no, Mas`r! ' tan't that,--it's bein' a freeman! that's what I'm joyin' for.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, Tom, don't you think, for your own part, you've been better off than to be free?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, indeed , Mas'r St. Clare,'' said Tom, with a flash of energy. '' No, indeed!'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, Tom, you couldn't possibly have earned, by your work, such clothes and such living as I have given you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Mas`r's been too good; but, Mas`r, I'd rather have poor clothes, poor house, poor everything, and have 'em mine , than have the best, and have 'em
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose so, Tom, and you'll be going off and leaving me, in a month or so,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, rather discontentedly.
<p/>Though why you shouldn't, no mortal knows,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, in a gayer tone; and, getting up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) began to walk the floor.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Knows all that, Mas'r St. Clare; any man's else,--I had so , Mas`r; I think it's natur, Mas`r.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>'' '' Not while Mas'r is in trouble,'' said Tom.
<p/>'' I'll stay with Mas'r as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wants me,--so as I can be any use. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not while I'm in trouble, Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, looking sadly out of the window.
<p/>... '' And when will my trouble be over?'' '' When Mas'r St. Clare's a Christian,'' said Tom. ''
<p/>And you really mean to stay by till that day comes?'' said St. Clare, half smiling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned from the window, and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand on Tom's shoulder.
<p/>'' Ah, Tom, you soft, silly boy! I won't keep you till that day. Go home to your wife and children, and give my love to all.
<p/>I 's faith to believe that day will come,'' said Tom, earnestly, and with tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes; <div class="bookquote">``the Lord has a work for Mas`r.
<p/>A work, hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, ``well, now, Tom, give me your views on what sort of a work it is;--let's hear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, even a poor fellow like me has a work from the Lord; and Mas'r St. Clare, that has larnin, and riches, and
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare friends</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' friends,--how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) might do for the Lord!'' '' Tom, you seem to think the Lord needs a great deal done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),'' said St. Clare, smiling.
<p/>'' We does for the Lord when we does for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) critturs,'' said Tom. '' Good theology, Tom; better than Dr. B. preaches, I dare swear,'' said St. Clare.
<p/>Marie St. Clare felt the loss of Eva as deeply as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) could feel anything; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was a woman that had a great faculty of making everybody unhappy when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was, her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) immediate attendants had still stronger reason to regret the loss of their young mistress, whose winning ways and gentle intercessions had so often been a shield to them from the tyrannical and selfish exactions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Poor old Mammy, in particular, whose heart, severed from all natural domestic ties, had consoled itself with this one beautiful being, was almost heart-broken.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) cried day and night, and was, from excess of sorrow, less skilful and alert in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) ministrations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) mistress than usual, which drew down a constant storm of invectives on her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) defenceless head.
<p/>The conversation was here interrupted by the announcement of some visitors. Miss Ophelia felt the loss; but, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) good and honest heart, it bore fruit unto everlasting life.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was more softened, more gentle; and, though equally assiduous in every duty, it was with a chastened and quiet air, as one who communed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own heart not in vain.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was more diligent in teaching Topsy,--taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) mainly from the Bible,--did not any longer shrink from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) touch, or manifest an ill-repressed disgust, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) felt none.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) viewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) now through the softened medium that Eva's hand had first held before her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) eyes, and saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) only an immortal creature, whom God had sent to be led by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to glory and virtue.
<p/>Topsy did not become at once a saint; but the life and death of Eva did work a marked change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>).
<p/>The callous indifference was gone; there was now sensibility, hope, desire, and the striving for good,--a strife irregular, interrupted, suspended oft, but yet renewed again.
<p/>One day, when Topsy had been sent for by Miss Ophelia, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) came, hastily thrusting something into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) bosom. '' What are you doing there, you limb?
<p/>You've been stealing something, I'll be bound,'' said the imperious little Rosa, who had been sent to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>), seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>), at the same time, roughly by the arm.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``None o' your sa`ce!''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa/Miss Rosa</b></font>)</div>said Rosa, <div class="bookquote">``I saw you hiding something,--I know yer tricks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa/Miss Rosa</b></font>)</div>and Rosa seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) arm, and tried to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) bosom, while Topsy, enraged, kicked and fought valiantly for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) rights.
<p/>'' You go `long, Miss Rosa!'' said Topsy, pulling from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>); ''`tan't none o' your business!'' The clamor and confusion of the battle drew Miss Ophelia and St. Clare both to the spot.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>)'s been stealing!'' said Rosa. '' I han't, neither!'' vociferated Topsy, sobbing with passion. <div class="bookquote">``Give me that, whatever it is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, firmly.
<p/>Topsy hesitated; but, on a second order, pulled out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) bosom a little parcel done up in the foot of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own old stockings.
<p/>There was a small book, which had been given to Topsy by Eva, containing a single verse of Scripture, arranged for every day in the year, and in a paper the curl of hair that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) on that memorable day when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) last farewell.
<p/>St. Clare was a good deal affected at the sight of it; the little book had been rolled in a long strip of black crape, torn from the funeral weeds.
<p/>Miss Ophelia turned it out. '' What did you wrap this round the book for?'' said St. Clare, holding up the crape.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said; and, sitting flat down on the floor, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) apron over her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) began to sob vehemently.
<p/>'' Cause,--cause,--cause ' t was Miss Eva. O, don't take 'em away, please!'' It was a curious mixture of the pathetic and the ludicrous,--the little old stockings,--black crape,--text-book,--fair, soft curl,--and Topsy's utter distress.
<p/>St. Clare smiled; but there were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Come, come,--don't cry; you shall have them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and, putting them together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) threw them into her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) lap, and drew Miss Ophelia with him (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) into the parlor.
<p/>'' I really think you can make something of that concern,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) said, pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) thumb backward over his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>'' Any mind that is capable of a real sorrow is capable of good. You must try and do something with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>).''
<p/>I have great hopes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>); but, Augustine,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) arm, <div class="bookquote">``one thing I want to ask; whose is this child to be?--yours or mine?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The child has improved greatly,'' said Miss Ophelia. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said Augustine. '' But not legally;--I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) to be mine legally,'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>'' Whew! cousin,'' said Augustine. '' What will the Abolition Society think? They'll have a day of fasting appointed for this backsliding, if you become a slaveholder!''
<p/>I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) mine, that I may have a right to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to the free States, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) liberty, that all I am trying to do be not undone.''
<p/>``O, nonsense! <div class="bookquote">``O, cousin, what an awful `doing evil that good may come'! I can't encourage it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to joke, but to reason,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>There is no use in my trying to make this child a Christian child, unless I save her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) from all the chances and reverses of slavery; and, if you really are willing I should have her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), I want you to give me a deed of gift, or some legal paper.''
<p/>'' '' Well, well,'' said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``I will;''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) sat down, and unfolded a newspaper to read. '' But I want it done now,'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>'' What's your hurry?'' '' Because now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in,'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>St. Clare, like most men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) class of mind, cordially hated the present tense of action, generally; and, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was considerably annoyed by Miss Ophelia's downrightness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, now, here's paper, pen, and ink; just write a paper.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Why, what's the matter?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>). '' Can't you take my word?
<p/>One would think you had taken lessons of the Jews, coming at a fellow so!'' <div class="bookquote">``I want to make sure of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>'' You may die, or fail, and then Topsy be hustled off to auction, spite of all I can do.'' <div class="bookquote">``Really, you are quite provident.
<p/>Well, seeing I'm in the hands of a Yankee, there is nothing for it but to concede;''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>and St. Clare rapidly wrote off a deed of gift, which, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yankee</b></font>) was well versed in the forms of law, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yankee</b></font>) could easily do, and signed his (<font color='blue'><b>Yankee</b></font>) name to it in sprawling capitals, concluding by a tremendous flourish.
<p/>'' There, isn't that black and white, now, Miss Vermont? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Yankee</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yankee</b></font>) handed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>). '' Good boy,'' said Miss Ophelia, smiling.
<p/>'' But must it not be witnessed?'' '' O, bother!--yes. Here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Yankee</b></font>) said, opening the door into Marie's apartment, <div class="bookquote">``Marie, Cousin wants your autograph; just put your name down here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What's this?'' said Marie, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) ran over the paper. '' Ridiculous! I thought Cousin was too pious for such horrid things,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) added, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) carelessly wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) name;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) has a fancy for that article, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s welcome. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' There, now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s yours, body and soul,'' said St. Clare, handing the paper.
<p/>'' No more mine now than she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) was before,'' Miss Ophelia. '' Nobody but God has a right to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to me; but I can protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) now.''
<p/>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)'s yours by a fiction of law, then,'' said St. Clare, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turned back into the parlor, and sat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) paper.
<p/>Miss Ophelia, who seldom sat much in Marie's company, followed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) into the parlor, having first carefully laid away the paper.
<p/>Augustine,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) said, suddenly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Augustine</b></font>) sat knitting, <div class="bookquote">``have you ever made any provision for your servants, in case of your death?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' No,'' said St. Clare, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) read on. '' Then all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty, by and by.
<p/>'' St. Clare had often thought the same thing himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) answered, negligently. '' Well, I mean to make a provision, by and by.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``When?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' O, one of these days. '' '' What if you should die first?'' <div class="bookquote">``Cousin, what's the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, laying down his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) paper and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>).
<p/>Do you think I show symptoms of yellow fever or cholera, that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal?
<p/>St. Clare rose up, and laying the paper down, carelessly, walked to the door that stood open on the verandah, to put an end to a conversation that was not agreeable to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' '' `In the midst of life we are in death,''' said Miss Ophelia. Mechanically, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) repeated the last word again,-- ``Death!
<p/>--and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) leaned against the railings, and watched the sparkling water as it rose and fell in the fountain; and, as in a dim and dizzy haze, saw flowers and trees and vases of the courts, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) repeated, again the mystic word so common in every mouth, yet of such fearful power,--<div class="bookquote">``DEATH!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Strange that there should be such a word,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and such a thing, and we ever forget it; that one should be living, warm and beautiful, full of hopes, desires and wants, one day, and the next be gone, utterly gone, and forever!
<p/>It was a warm, golden evening; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) walked to the other end of the verandah, he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) saw Tom busily intent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) Bible, pointing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) did so, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) finger to each successive word, and whispering them to himself with an earnest air.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Want me to read to you, Tom?''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, seating himself carelessly by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). '' If Mas'r pleases,'' said Tom, gratefully, ``Mas'r makes it so much plainer.
<p/>St. Clare took the book and glanced at the place, and began reading one of the passages which Tom had designated by the heavy marks around it.
<p/>It ran as follows: <div class="bookquote">``When the Son of man shall come in his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) glory, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) holy angels with him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>), then shall he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) sit upon the throne of his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) glory: and before him (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) shall be gathered all nations; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) sheep from the goats.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' St. Clare read on in an animated voice, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) came to the last of the verses. '' Then shall the king say unto him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire:
<p/>for I was an hungered, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink : I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not:
<p/>Then shall they answer unto Him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), Lord when saw we thee an hungered, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?
<p/>Then shall he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) say unto them, Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these my brethren,
<p/>St. Clare seemed struck with this last passage, for he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) read it twice,--the second time slowly, and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) were revolving the words in his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Tom,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``these folks that get such hard measure seem to have been doing just what I have,--living good, easy, respectable lives; and not troubling themselves to inquire how many of their brethren were hungry or athirst, or sick, or in prison.
<p/>I was sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not. ye did it not to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' Tom did not answer.
<p/>St. Clare rose up and walked thoughtfully up and down the verandah, seeming to forget everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own thoughts; so absorbed was he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), that Tom had to remind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) twice that the teabell had rung, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could get his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) attention.
<p/>St. Clare was absent and thoughtful, all tea-time. After tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Marie and Miss Ophelia took possession of the parlor almost in silence.
<p/>Marie disposed herself on a lounge, under a silken mosquito curtain, and was soon sound asleep. Miss Ophelia silently busied herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) knitting.
<p/>St. Clare sat down to the piano, and began playing a soft and melancholy movement with the Æolian accompaniment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seemed in a deep reverie, and to be soliloquizing to himself by music.
<p/>After a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) opened one of the drawers, took out an old music-book whose leaves were yellow with age, and began turning it over.
<p/>There,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said to Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``this was one of my mother's books,--and here is her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) handwriting,--come and look at it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) copied and arranged this from Mozart's Requiem. '' Miss Ophelia came accordingly. '' It was something she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) used to sing often,'' said St. Clare.
<p/>'' I think I can hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) now. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>) struck a few majestic chords, and began singing that grand old Latin piece, the ``Dies Iræ.
<p/>Tom, who was listening in the outer verandah, was drawn by the sound to the very door, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood earnestly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not understand the words, of course; but the music and manner of singing appeared to affect him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strongly, especially when St. Clare sang the more pathetic parts.
<p/>Tom would have sympathized more heartily, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had known the meaning of the beautiful words:-- <div class="bookquote">``Recordare Jesu pie Quod sum causa tuær viæ
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ne me perdas , illa die Quærens me sedisti lassus Redemisti crucem passus Tantus labor non sit cassus. '' *
<p/>These lines have been thus rather inadequately translated: <div class="bookquote">``Think, O Jesus, for what reason Thou endured`st earth's spite and treason, Nor me lose, in that dread season; Seeking me, thy worn feet hasted, On the cross thy soul death tasted,
<p/>St. Clare threw a deep and pathetic expression into the words; for the shadowy veil of years seemed drawn away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) seemed to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) mother's voice leading his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>).
<p/>Voice and instrument seemed both living, and threw out with vivid sympathy those strains which the ethereal Mozart first conceived as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>) own dying requiem.
<p/>When St. Clare had done singing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>) sat leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>) hand a few moments, and then began walking up and down the floor.
<p/>What a sublime conception is that of a last judgment!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mozart</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``a righting of all the wrongs of ages!--a solving of all moral problems, by an unanswerable wisdom!
<p/>* Let not all these toils be wasted.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LSB-Mrs. Stowe's note.-RSB- '' It is, indeed, a wonderful image.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is a fearful one to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>I was reading to Tom, this afternoon, that chapter in Matthew that gives an account of it, and I have been quite struck with it.
<p/>One should have expected some terrible enormities charged to those who are excluded from Heaven, as the reason; but no,--they are condemned for not doing positive good, as if that included every possible harm.''
<p/>'' It ought to be to me, I suppose,'' said St. Clare stopping, thoughtfully. '' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``it is impossible for a person who does no good not to do harm.
<p/>And what,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, speaking abstractedly, but with deep feeling, <div class="bookquote">``what shall be said of one whose own heart, whose education, and the wants of society, have called in vain to some noble purpose; who has floated on, a dreamy, neutral spectator of the struggles, agonies, and wrongs of man, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have been a worker?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I should say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to repent, and begin now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Always practical and to the point!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>said St. Clare, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face breaking out into a smile.
<p/>You never leave me any time for general reflections, Cousin; you always bring me short up against the actual present; you have a kind of eternal now , always in your mind.''
<p/>'' '' Now is all the time I have anything to do with,'' said Miss Ophelia. '' Dear little Eva,--poor child!'' said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) little simple soul on a good work for me.
<p/>It was the first time since Eva's death that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) had ever said as many words as these to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) spoke now evidently repressing very strong feeling.
<p/>My view of Christianity is such,''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``that I think no man can consistently profess it without throwing the whole weight of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being against this monstrous system of injustice that lies at the foundation of all our society; and, if need be, sacrificing himself in the battle.
<p/>That is, I mean that I could not be a Christian otherwise, though I have certainly had intercourse with a great many enlightened and Christian people who did no such thing; and I confess that the apathy of religious people on this subject, their want of perception of wrongs that filled me with horror, have engendered in me more scepticism than any other thing.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>O, because I have had only that kind of benevolence which consists in lying on a sofa, and cursing the church and clergy for not being martyrs and confessors.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``If you knew all this,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, <div class="bookquote">``why didn't you do it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>'' One can see, you know, very easily, how others ought to be martyrs.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, are you going to do differently now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' God only knows the future,'' said St. Clare. ''
<p/>I am braver than I was, because I have lost all; and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) who has nothing to lose can afford all risks.
<p/>My duty, I hope, to the poor and lowly, as fast as I find it out,'' said St. Clare, <div class="bookquote">``beginning with my own servants, for whom I have yet done nothing; and, perhaps, at some future day, it may appear that I can do something for a whole class; something to save my country from the disgrace of that false position in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clare</b></font>) now stands before all civilized nations.''
 (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' And what are you going to do?'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Do you suppose it possible that a nation ever will voluntarily emancipate?''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>'' I don't know,'' said St. Clare. '' This is a day of great deeds. Heroism and disinterestedness are rising up, here and there, in the earth.
<p/>The Hungarian nobles set free millions of serfs, at an immense pecuniary loss; and, perhaps, among us may be found generous spirits, who do not estimate honor and justice by dollars and cents.''
<p/>But, suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate, who would educate these millions, and teach them how to use their freedom?
<p/>The fact is, we are too lazy and unpractical, ourselves, ever to give them much of an idea of that industry and energy which is necessary to form them into men.
<p/>They will have to go north, where labor is the fashion,--the universal custom; and tell me, now, is there enough Christian philanthropy, among your northern states, to bear with the process of their education and elevation?
<p/>You send thousands of dollars to foreign missions; but could you endure to have the heathen sent into your towns and villages, and give your time, and thoughts, and money, to raise them to the Christian standard?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hardly think so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' They never would rise to do much among us. That's what I want to know.
<p/>How many families, in your town, would take a negro man and woman, teach them, bear with them, and seek to make them Christians?
<p/>How many merchants would take Adolph, if I wanted to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) a clerk; or mechanics, if I wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) taught a trade?
<p/>If I wanted to put Jane and Rosa to a school, how many schools are there in the northern states that would take them in?
<p/>If we emancipate, are you willing to educate? how many families that would board them? and yet they are as white as many a woman, north or south.
<p/>We are the more obvious oppressors of the negro; but the unchristian prejudice of the north is an oppressor almost equally severe.''
<p/>Well, Cousin, I know it is so,'' said Miss Ophelia,--<div class="bookquote">``I know it was so with me, till I saw that it was my duty to overcome it; but,
<p/>I trust I have overcome it; and I know there are many good people at the north, who in this matter need only to be taught what their duty is, to do it.
<p/>It would certainly be a greater self-denial to receive heathen among us, than to send missionaries to them; but I think we would do it.
<p/>You see, Cousin, I want justice done us. We are in a bad position. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>'' '' You would, I know,'' said St. Clare.
<p/>'' I'd like to see anything you wouldn't do, if you thought it your duty!'' '' Well, I'm not uncommonly good,'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>'' Others would, if they saw things as I do. I intend to take Topsy home, when I go. I suppose our folks will wonder, at first; but I think they will be brought to see as I do.
<p/>Yes, but they are a minority; and, if we should begin to emancipate to any extent, we should soon hear from you.
<p/>Besides, I know there are many people at the north who do exactly what you said. '' '' '' Miss Ophelia did not reply.
<p/>There was a pause of some moments; and St. Clare's countenance was overcast by a sad, dreamy expression. '' I don't know what makes me think of my mother so much, tonight,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I have a strange kind of feeling, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were near me. I keep thinking of things she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to say.
<p/>St. Clare walked up and down the room for some minutes more, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``I believe I'll go down street, a few moments, and hear the news, tonight.
<p/>Strange, what brings these past things so vividly back to us, sometimes!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) hat, and passed out. Tom followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to the passage, out of the court, and asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should attend him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>'' No, my boy,'' said St. Clare. '' I shall be back in an hour. '' Tom sat down in the verandah.
<p/>It was a beautiful moonlight evening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat watching the rising and falling spray of the fountain, and listening to its murmur.
<p/>Tom thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) home, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should soon be a free man, and able to return to it at will.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt the muscles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brawny arms with a sort of joy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought they would soon belong to himself, and how much they could do to work out the freedom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) family.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) noble young master, and, ever second to that, came the habitual prayer that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had always offered for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thoughts passed on to the beautiful Eva, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) now thought of among the angels; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought till he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) almost fancied that that bright face and golden hair were looking upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), out of the spray of the fountain.
<p/>And, so musing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fell asleep, and dreamed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) coming bounding towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) used to come, with a wreath of jessamine in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) hair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) cheeks bright, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes radiant with delight; but, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) seemed to rise from the ground; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) cheeks wore a paler hue,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) eyes had a deep, divine radiance, a golden halo seemed around her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) head,--and
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sight; and Tom was awakened by a loud knocking, and a sound of many voices at the gate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hastened to undo it; and, with smothered voices and heavy tread, came several men, bringing a body, wrapped in a cloak, and lying on a shutter.
<p/>The light of the lamp fell full on the face; and Tom gave a wild cry of amazement and despair, that rung through all the galleries, as the men advanced, with their burden, to the open parlor door, where Miss Ophelia still sat knitting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought how he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should work to buy his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wife and boys. St. Clare had turned into a cafe, to look over an evening paper.
<p/>St. Clare and one or two others made an effort to separate them, and St. Clare received a fatal stab in the side with a bowie-knife, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was attempting to wrest from one of them.
<p/>The house was full of cries and lamentations, shrieks and screams, servants frantically tearing their hair, throwing themselves on the ground, or running distractedly about, lamenting.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was reading, an affray arose between two gentlemen in the room, who were both partially intoxicated. Tom and Miss Ophelia alone seemed to have any presence of mind; for Marie was in strong hysteric convulsions.
<p/>At Miss Ophelia's direction, one of the lounges in the parlor was hastily prepared, and the bleeding form laid upon it.
<p/>St. Clare had fainted, through pain and loss of blood; but, as Miss Ophelia applied restoratives, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) revived, opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, looked fixedly on them, looked earnestly around the room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes travelling wistfully over every object, and finally they rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mother's picture.
<p/>It was evident, from the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face, that there was no hope; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) applied himself to dressing the wound, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Miss Ophelia and Tom proceeded composedly with this work, amid the lamentations and sobs and cries of the affrighted servants, who had clustered about the doors and windows of the verandah.
<p/>The physician now arrived, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) examination. '' Now,'' said the physician, <div class="bookquote">``we must turn all these creatures out; all depends on his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) being kept quiet.
<p/>St. Clare opened his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) eyes, and looked fixedly on the distressed beings, whom Miss Ophelia and the doctor were trying to urge from the apartment.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the physician</b></font>)</div>'' Poor creatures! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) said, and an expression of bitter self-reproach passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face. Adolph absolutely refused to go.
<p/>Terror had deprived him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) of all presence of mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) threw himself along the floor, and nothing could persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) to rise.
<p/>St. Clare could say but little; he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) lay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) eyes shut, but it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) wrestled with bitter thoughts.
<p/>The rest yielded to Miss Ophelia's urgent representations, that their master's safety depended on their stillness and obedience. After a while, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hand on Tom's, who was kneeling beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">``Tom! poor fellow!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What, Mas`r?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, earnestly. '' I am dying!'' said St. Clare, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand; <div class="bookquote">``pray!''  (<font color='red'><b>Clare/St. Clare/Augustine</b></font>)</div>'' If you would like a clergyman--'' said the physician.
<p/>And Tom did pray, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind and strength, for the soul that was passing,--the soul that seemed looking so steadily and mournfully from those large, melancholy blue eyes.
<p/>St. Clare hastily shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head, and said again to Tom, more earnestly, <div class="bookquote">``Pray!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>It was literally prayer offered with strong crying and tears.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, but still retained his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hold; for, in the gates of eternity, the black hand and the white hold each other with an equal clasp.
<p/>When Tom ceased to speak, St. Clare reached out and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, looking earnestly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), but saying nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) murmured softly to himself, at broken intervals, <div class="bookquote">``Recordare Jesu
<p/>It was evident that the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been singing that evening were passing through his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind,--words of entreaty addressed to Infinite Pity.
<p/>pie-- * * * * Ne me perdas--illa die Quærens me--sedisti lassus. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips moved at intervals, as parts of the hymn fell brokenly from them.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind is wandering,'' said the doctor. '' No! it is coming HOME, at last!'' said St. Clare, energetically; <div class="bookquote">``at last!
<p/>The sinking paleness of death fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>); but with it there fell, as if shed from the wings of some pitying spirit, a beautiful expression of peace, like that of a wearied child who sleeps.
<p/>at last! ''  (<font color='red'><b>St. Clare</b></font>)</div>The effort of speaking exhausted him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lay for a few moments. They saw that the mighty hand was on him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>Just before the spirit parted, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes, with a sudden light, as of joy and recognition, and said <div class="bookquote">``Mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>We hear often of the distress of the negro servants, on the loss of a kind master; and with good reason, for no creature on God's earth is left more utterly unprotected and desolate than the slave in these circumstances.
<p/>The child who has lost a father has still the protection of friends, and of the law; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is something, and can do something,--has acknowledged rights and position; the slave has none.
<p/>and then he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) was gone! CHAPTER XXIX The Unprotected The law regards him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), in every respect, as devoid of rights as a bale of merchandise.
<p/>The only possible acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a human and immortal creature, which are given to him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>), comes to him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) through the sovereign and irresponsible will of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) master; and when that master is stricken down, nothing remains.
<p/>Everybody knows this, and the slave knows it best of all; so that he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) feels that there are ten chances of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) finding an abusive and tyrannical master, to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) finding a considerate and kind one.
<p/>The number of those men who know how to use wholly irresponsible power humanely and generously is small. Therefore is it that the wail over a kind master is loud and long, as well it may be.
<p/>When St. Clare breathed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) last, terror and consternation took hold of all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) household. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had been stricken down so in a moment, in the flower and strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) youth!
<p/>Marie, whose nervous system had been enervated by a constant course of self-indulgence, had nothing to support the terror of the shock, and, at the time her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) husband breathed his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last, was passing from one fainting fit to another; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) had been joined in the mysterious tie of marriage passed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) forever, without the possibility of even a parting word.
<p/>Miss Ophelia, with characteristic strength and self-control, had remained with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) kinsman to the last,--all eye, all ear, all attention; doing everything of the little that could be done, and joining with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) whole soul in the tender and impassioned prayers which the poor slave had poured forth for the soul of his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) dying master.
<p/>When they were arranging him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) last rest, they found upon his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) bosom a small, plain miniature case, opening with a spring.
<p/>It was the miniature of a noble and beautiful female face; and on the reverse, under a crystal, a lock of dark hair.
<p/>They laid them back on the lifeless breast,--dust to dust,--poor mournful relics of early dreams, which once made that cold heart beat so warmly!
<p/>Tom's whole soul was filled with thoughts of eternity; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ministered around the lifeless clay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not once think that the sudden stroke had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in hopeless slavery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt at peace about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master; for in that hour, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had poured forth his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) prayer into the bosom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had found an answer of quietness and assurance springing up within himself.
<p/>In the depths of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own affectionate nature, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt able to perceive something of the fulness of Divine love; for an old oracle hath thus written,--<div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Every room and gallery of the house resounded with sobs and shrieks of despair. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Tom hoped and trusted, and was at peace.
<p/>But the funeral passed, with all its pageant of black crape, and prayers, and solemn faces; and back rolled the cool, muddy waves of every-day life; and up came the everlasting hard inquiry of <div class="bookquote">``What is to be done next?
<p/>It rose to the mind of Marie, as, dressed in loose morning-robes, and surrounded by anxious servants, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) sat up in a great easy-chair, and inspected samples of crape and bombazine.
<p/>It rose, in silent terrors, to the minds of the servants, who well knew the unfeeling, tyrannical character of the mistress in whose hands they were left.
<p/>All knew, very well, that the indulgences which had been accorded to them were not from their mistress, but from their master; and that, now he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was gone, there would be no screen between them and every tyrannous infliction which a temper soured by affliction might devise.
<p/>It was about a fortnight after the funeral, that Miss Ophelia, busied one day in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) apartment, heard a gentle tap at the door.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) opened it, and there stood Rosa, the pretty young quadroon, whom we have before often noticed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) hair in disorder, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) eyes swelled with crying.
<p/>O, Miss Feeley,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Feeley</b></font>) said, falling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Feeley</b></font>) knees, and catching the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Feeley</b></font>) dress, '' do, do go to Miss Marie for me!
<p/>'' It rose to Miss Ophelia, who began to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) thoughts towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) northern home. '' do plead for me!
<p/>It was an order, written in Marie's delicate Italian hand, to the master of a whipping-establishment to give the bearer fifteen lashes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s goin' to send me out to be whipped--look there! '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) handed to Miss Ophelia a paper. '' What have you been doing?'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>I was trying on Miss Marie's dress, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) slapped my face; and I spoke out before I thought, and was saucy; and
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>)'d bring me down, and have me know, once for all, that I wasn't going to be so topping as I had been; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) wrote this, and says I shall carry it.
<p/>'' You know, Miss Feely, I've got such a bad temper; it's very bad of me. I'd rather she (<font color='blue'><b>Feely</b></font>)'d kill me, right out.
<p/>You see, Miss Feely,'' said Rosa, <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind the whipping so much, if Miss Marie or you was to do it; but, to be sent to a man!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosa/Miss Rosa</b></font>)</div>Miss Ophelia stood considering, with the paper in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) hand. '' and such a horrid man,--the shame of it, Miss Feely!
<p/>Miss Ophelia well knew that it was the universal custom to send women and young girls to whipping-houses, to the hands of the lowest of men,--men vile enough to make this their profession,--there to be subjected to brutal exposure and shameful correction.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had known it before; but hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had never realized it, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) saw the slender form of Rosa almost convulsed with distress.
<p/>All the honest blood of womanhood, the strong New England blood of liberty, flushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) cheeks, and throbbed bitterly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) indignant heart; but, with habitual prudence and self-control, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) mastered herself, and, crushing the paper firmly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) merely said to Rosa, <div class="bookquote">``Sit down, child, while I go to your mistress.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Rosa/Miss Rosa</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) found Marie sitting up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) easy-chair, with Mammy standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), combing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) hair; Jane sat on the ground before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), busy in chafing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feet.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Shameful! monstrous! outrageous! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was crossing the parlor. '' How do you find yourself, today?'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>A deep sigh, and a closing of the eyes, was the only reply, for a moment; and then Marie answered, <div class="bookquote">``O, I don't know, Cousin; I suppose I'm as well as I ever shall be!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>and Marie wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) eyes with a cambric handkerchief, bordered with an inch deep of black.
<p/>I came,'' said Miss Ophelia, with a short, dry cough, such as commonly introduces a difficult subject,--``I came to speak with you about poor Rosa.
<p/>Marie's eyes were open wide enough now, and a flush rose to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) sallow cheeks, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) answered, sharply, <div class="bookquote">``Well, what about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is very sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) fault.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'ll be sorrier, before I've done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)!
<p/>I've endured that child's impudence long enough; and now I'll bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) down,--I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lie in the dust!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But could not you punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) some other way,--some way that would be less shameful?''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) has all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) life presumed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) delicacy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) good looks, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lady-like airs, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) forgets who she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) is;--and
<p/>'' I mean to shame her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>); that's just what I want. I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) one lesson that will bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) down,

<p/>I fancy!'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Delicacy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie, with a scornful laugh,--<div class="bookquote">``a fine word for such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)! I'll teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) airs, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'s no better than the raggedest black wench that walks the streets!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>)'ll take no more airs with me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will answer to God for such cruelty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, with energy. ''
<p/>Cruelty,--I'd like to know what the cruelty is! I wrote orders for only fifteen lashes, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to put them on lightly.
<p/>I'm sure there's no cruelty there!'' <div class="bookquote">``No cruelty!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia. '' I'm sure any girl might rather be killed outright!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It might seem so to anybody with your feeling; but all these creatures get used to it; it's the only way they can be kept in order.
<p/>Once let them feel that they are to take any airs about delicacy, and all that, and they'll run all over you, just as my servants always have.
<p/>I've begun now to bring them under; and I'll have them all to know that I'll send one out to be whipped, as soon as another, if they don't mind themselves!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie, looking around her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) decidedly.
<p/>Jane hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head and cowered at this, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt as if it was particularly directed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). Miss Ophelia sat for a moment, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had swallowed some explosive mixture, and were ready to burst.
<p/>Then, recollecting the utter uselessness of contention with such a nature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) lips resolutely, gathered herself up, and walked out of the room.
<p/>It was hard to go back and tell Rosa that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) could do nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>); and, shortly after, one of the man-servants came to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) mistress had ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to take Rosa with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) to the whipping-house, whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) was hurried, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosa</b></font>) tears and entreaties.
<p/>A few days after, Tom was standing musing by the balconies, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was joined by Adolph, who, since the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master, had been entirely crest-fallen and disconsolate.
<p/>Adolph knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) had always been an object of dislike to Marie; but while his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) master lived he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) had paid but little attention to it.
<p/>Now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) was gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) had moved about in daily dread and trembling, not knowing what might befall him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) next.
<p/>Marie had held several consultations with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) lawyer; after communicating with St. Clare's brother, it was determined to sell the place, and all the servants, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) own personal property, and these she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) intended to take with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>), and go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) father's plantation.
<p/>'' Do ye know, Tom, that we've all got to be sold?'' said Adolph. '' How did you hear that?'' said Tom.
<p/>'' I hid myself behind the curtains when Missis was talking with the lawyer. In a few days we shall be sent off to auction, Tom.''
<p/>We'll never get another such a master,'' said Adolph, apprehensively; <div class="bookquote">``but I'd rather be sold than take my chance under Missis.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>The Lord's will be done!'' said Tom, folding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arms and sighing heavily. '' '' Tom turned away; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart was full.
<p/>The hope of liberty, the thought of distant wife and children, rose up before his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) patient soul, as to the mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises the vision of the church-spire and loving roofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) native village, seen over the top of some black wave only for one last farewell.
<p/>The poor old soul had such a singular, unaccountable prejudice in favor of liberty, that it was a hard wrench for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Thy will be done,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the worse he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arms tightly over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bosom, and choked back the bitter tears, and tried to pray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sought Miss Ophelia, who, ever since Eva's death, had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with marked and respectful kindness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had begun to take it out for me; and now, perhaps, if Miss Feely would be good enough to speak bout it to Missis, she (<font color='blue'><b>Feely</b></font>) would feel like goin' on with it, was it as
<p/>'' Miss Feely,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Mas'r St. Clare promised me my freedom. Mas'r St. Clare's wish. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll speak for you, Tom, and do my best,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but, if it depends on Mrs. St. Clare, I can't hope much for you;--nevertheless, I will try. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>This incident occurred a few days after that of Rosa, while Miss Ophelia was busied in preparations to return north.
<p/>Seriously reflecting within herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) considered that perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) had shown too hasty a warmth of language in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) former interview with Marie; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) would now endeavor to moderate her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) zeal, and to be as conciliatory as possible.
<p/>So the good soul gathered herself up, and, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) knitting, resolved to go into Marie's room, be as agreeable as possible, and negotiate Tom's case with all the diplomatic skill of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was mistress.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) found Marie reclining at length upon a lounge, supporting herself on one elbow by pillows, while Jane, who had been out shopping, was displaying before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) certain samples of thin black stuffs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws, Missis,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, volubly, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. General Derbennon wore just this very thing, after the General died, last summer; it makes up lovely!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>That will do,'' said Marie, selecting one; <div class="bookquote">``only I'm not sure about its being properly mourning.''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>'' '' What do you think?'' said Marie to Miss Ophelia.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``The fact is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie, <div class="bookquote">``that I haven't a dress in the world that I can wear; and, as I am going to break up the establishment, and go off,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>It's a matter of custom, I suppose,'' said Miss Ophelia. '' You can judge about it better than I. next week, I must decide upon something.''
<p/>St. Clare's brother has written, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and the lawyer think that the servants and furniture had better be put up at auction, and the place left with our lawyer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you going so soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. '' '' There's one thing I wanted to speak with you about,'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>'' Augustine promised Tom his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) liberty, and began the legal forms necessary to it. I hope you will use your influence to have it perfected.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I shall do no such thing!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie, sharply. '' Tom is one of the most valuable servants on the place,--it couldn't be afforded, any way.
<p/>Besides, what does he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) want of liberty? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s a great deal better off as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is.'' '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) does desire it, very earnestly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master promised it,'' said Miss Ophelia.
<p/>I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) does want it,'' said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``they all want it, just because they are a discontented set,--always wanting what they haven't got.
<p/>Keep a negro under the care of a master, and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) does well enough, and is respectable; but set them free, and they get lazy, and won't work, and take to drinking, and go all down to be mean, worthless fellows, I've seen it tried, hundreds of times.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>Now, I'm principled against emancipating, in any case. It's no favor to set them free.'' '' But Tom is so steady, industrious, and pious.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, you needn't tell me! I've see a hundred like him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll do very well, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s taken care
<p/>But, then, consider,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, ``when you set him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up for sale, the chances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) getting a bad master.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, that's all humbug!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Marie; <div class="bookquote">``it isn't one time in a hundred that a good fellow gets a bad master; most masters are good, for all the talk that is made.
<p/>I've lived and grown up here, in the South, and I never yet was acquainted with a master that didn't treat his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) servants well,--quite as well as is worth while.
<p/>Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marie/Marie St. Clare/St. Clare</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ophelia, energetically, <div class="bookquote">``I know it was one of the last wishes of your husband that Tom should have his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) liberty
<p/>; it was one of the promises that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made to dear little Eva on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) death-bed, and I should not think you would feel at liberty to disregard it.
<p/>Marie had her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) face covered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) handkerchief at this appeal, and began sobbing and using her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) smelling-bottle, with great vehemence.
<p/>of,--that's all.''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>'' '' I don't feel any fears on that head.'' '' '' '' Everybody goes against me! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Everybody is so inconsiderate! I shouldn't have expected that you would bring up all these remembrances of my troubles to me,--it's so inconsiderate!
<p/>But nobody ever does consider,--my trials are so peculiar! It's so hard, that when I had only one daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should have been taken!--and when I had a husband
<p/>that just exactly suited me,--and I'm so hard to be suited!--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should be taken! And you seem to have so little feeling for me, and keep bringing it up to me
<p/>And Marie sobbed, and gasped for breath, and called Mammy to open the window, and to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) the camphor-bottle, and to bathe her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) head, and unhook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) dress.
<p/>so carelessly,--when you know how it overcomes me! I suppose you mean well; but it is very inconsiderate,--very!'' And, in the general confusion that ensued, Miss Ophelia made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) escape to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) apartment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) saw, at once, that it would do no good to say anything more; for Marie had an indefinite capacity for hysteric fits; and, after this, whenever her (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) husband's or Eva's wishes with regard to the servants were alluded to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marie</b></font>) always found it convenient to set one in operation.
<p/>Miss Ophelia, therefore, did the next best thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) could for Tom,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) wrote a letter to Mrs. Shelby for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), stating his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) troubles, and urging them to send to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) relief.
<p/>The next day, Tom and Adolph, and some half a dozen other servants, were marched down to a slave-warehouse, to await the convenience of the trader, who was going to make up a lot for auction.
<p/>CHAPTER XXX The Slave Warehouse A slave warehouse! Perhaps some of my readers conjure up horrible visions of such a place.
<p/>But no, innocent friend; in these days men have learned the art of sinning expertly and genteelly, so as not to shock the eyes and senses of respectable society.
<p/>Human property is high in the market; and is, therefore, well fed, well cleaned, tended, and looked after, that it may come to sale sleek, and strong, and shining.
<p/>A slave-warehouse in New Orleans is a house externally not much unlike many others, kept with neatness; and where every day you may see arranged, under a sort of shed along the outside, rows of men and women, who stand there as a sign of the property sold within.
<p/>Then you shall be courteously entreated to call and examine, and shall find an abundance of husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, fathers, mothers, and young children, to be <div class="bookquote">``sold separately, or in lots to suit the convenience of the purchaser;''  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>and that soul immortal, once bought with blood and anguish by the Son of God, when the earth shook, and the rocks rent, and the graves were opened, can be sold, leased, mortgaged, exchanged for groceries or dry goods, to suit the phases of trade, or the fancy of the purchaser.
<p/>It was a day or two after the conversation between Marie and Miss Ophelia, that Tom, Adolph, and about half a dozen others of the St. Clare estate, were turned over to the loving kindness of Mr. Skeggs, the keeper of a depot on -- street, to await the auction, next day.
<p/>They fancy some foul, obscure den, some horrible Tartarus <div class="bookquote">``informis, ingens, cui lumen ademptum. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Tom had with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) quite a sizable trunk full of clothing, as had most others of them.
<p/>They were ushered, for the night, into a long room, where many other men, of all ages, sizes, and shades of complexion, were assembled, and from which roars of laughter and unthinking merriment were proceeding.
<p/>'' Ah, ha! that's right. Go it, boys,--go it!'' said Mr. Skeggs, the keeper. '' My people are always so merry!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Skeggs</b></font>) said, speaking approvingly to a burly negro who was performing tricks of low buffoonery, which occasioned the shouts which Tom had heard.
<p/>As might be imagined, Tom was in no humor to join these proceedings; and, therefore, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) trunk as far as possible from the noisy group, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat down on it, and leaned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face against the wall.
<p/>The dealers in the human article make scrupulous and systematic efforts to promote noisy mirth among them, as a means of drowning reflection, and rendering them insensible to their condition.
<p/>The whole object of the training to which the negro is put, from the time he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) is sold in the northern market till he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) arrives south, is systematically directed towards making him (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) callous, unthinking, and brutal.
<p/>The slave-dealer collects his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) gang in Virginia or Kentucky, and drives them to some convenient, healthy place,--often a watering place,--to be fattened.
<p/>Here they are fed full daily; and, because some incline to pine, a fiddle is kept commonly going among them, and they are made to dance daily; and he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) who refuses to be merry--in whose soul thoughts of wife, or child, or home, are too strong for him (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) to be gay--is marked as sullen and dangerous, and subjected to all the evils which the ill will of an utterly irresponsible and hardened man can inflict upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Briskness, alertness, and cheerfulness of appearance, especially before observers, are constantly enforced upon them, both by the hope of thereby getting a good master, and the fear of all that the driver may bring upon them if they prove unsalable.
<p/>Sambo, I see! '' '' What dat ar nigger doin here?'' said Sambo, coming up to Tom, after Mr. Skeggs had left the room.
<p/>Sambo was a full black, of great size, very lively, voluble, and full of trick and grimace. '' What you doin here?'' said Sambo, coming up to Tom, and poking him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) facetiously in the side.
<p/>'' Meditatin', eh?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am to be sold at the auction tomorrow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, quietly. '' Sold at auction,--haw! haw! boys, an't this yer fun?
<p/>I wish't I was gwine that ar way!--tell ye, wouldn't I make em laugh? But how is it,--dis yer whole lot gwine tomorrow?'' said Sambo, laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) hand freely on Adolph's shoulder.
<p/>'' Please to let me alone!'' said Adolph, fiercely, straightening himself up, with extreme disgust. '' Law, now, boys! dis yer's one o
<p/>' yer white niggers,--kind o' cream color, ye know, scented! '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>), coming up to Adolph and snuffing. '' O Lor!
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>)'d do for a tobaccer-shop; they could keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) to scent snuff! Lor, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>)'d keep a whole shope agwine,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) would!'' <div class="bookquote">``I say, keep off, can't you?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>said Adolph, enraged. '' Lor, now, how touchy we is,--we white niggers! Look at us now!'' and Sambo gave a ludicrous imitation of Adolph's manner; <div class="bookquote">``here's de airs and graces.
<p/>We's been in a good family, I specs. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' said Adolph; <div class="bookquote">``I had a master that could have bought you all for old truck!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws, now, only think,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sambo</b></font>)</div>said Sambo, <div class="bookquote">``the gentlemens that we is!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sambo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I belonged to the St. Clare family,''  (<font color='red'><b>Adolph/Mr. Adolph</b></font>)</div>said Adolph, proudly.
<p/>Spects they's gwine to trade ye off with a lot o' cracked tea-pots and sich like!'' said Sambo, with a provoking grin.
<p/>'' Lor, you did! Be hanged if they ar'n't lucky to get shet of ye. Adolph, enraged at this taunt, flew furiously at his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) adversary, swearing and striking on every side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>).
<p/>The rest laughed and shouted, and the uproar brought the keeper to the door. '' What now, boys? Order,--order! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) said, coming in and flourishing a large whip.
<p/>All fled in different directions, except Sambo, who, presuming on the favor which the keeper had to him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) as a licensed wag, stood his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) ground, ducking his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) head with a facetious grin, whenever the master made a dive at him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>'' Lor, Mas`r, `tan't us,--we 's reglar stiddy,--it's these yer new hands; they 's real aggravatin',--kinder pickin' at us, all time!
<p/>The keeper, at this, turned upon Tom and Adolph, and distributing a few kicks and cuffs without much inquiry, and leaving general orders for all to be good boys and go to sleep, left the apartment.
<p/>While this scene was going on in the men's sleeping-room, the reader may be curious to take a peep at the corresponding apartment allotted to the women.
<p/>Stretched out in various attitudes over the floor, he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) may see numberless sleeping forms of every shade of complexion, from the purest ebony to white, and of all years, from childhood to old age, lying now asleep.
<p/>Here is a fine bright girl, of ten years, whose mother was sold out yesterday, and who tonight cried herself to sleep when nobody was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>Here, a worn old negress, whose thin arms and callous fingers tell of hard toil, waiting to be sold tomorrow, as a cast-off article, for what can be got for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); and some forty or fifty others, with heads variously enveloped in blankets or articles of clothing, lie stretched around them.
<p/>One of these is a respectably-dressed mulatto woman between forty and fifty, with soft eyes and a gentle and pleasing physiognomy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head a high-raised turban, made of a gay red Madras handkerchief, of the first quality, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dress is neatly fitted, and of good material, showing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has been provided for with a careful hand.
<p/>'' But, in a corner, sitting apart from the rest, are two females of a more interesting appearance than common. By her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) side, and nestling closely to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), is a young girl of fifteen,--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a quadroon, as may be seen from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fairer complexion, though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) likeness to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother is quite discernible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has the same soft, dark eye, with longer lashes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) curling hair is of a luxuriant brown. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) also is dressed with great neatness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) white, delicate hands betray very little acquaintance with servile toil.
<p/>These two are to be sold tomorrow, in the same lot with the St. Clare servants; and the gentleman to whom they belong, and to whom the money for their sale is to be transmitted, is a member of a Christian church in New York, who will receive the money, and go thereafter to the sacrament of his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) Lord and theirs, and think no more of it.
<p/>These two, whom we shall call Susan and Emmeline, had been the personal attendants of an amiable and pious lady of New Orleans, by whom they had been carefully and piously instructed and trained.
<p/>They had been taught to read and write, diligently instructed in the truths of religion, and their lot had been as happy an one as in their condition
<p/>But the only son of their protectress had the management of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) property; and, by carelessness and extravagance involved it to a large amount, and at last failed.
<p/>it was possible to be. One of the largest creditors was the respectable firm of B. & Co., in New York.
<p/>B. & Co. wrote to their lawyer in New Orleans, who attached the real estate -LRB-these two articles and a lot of plantation hands formed the most valuable part of it-RRB-, and wrote word to that effect to New York.
<p/>Brother B., being, as we have said, a Christian man, and a resident in a free State, felt some uneasiness on the subject.
<p/>but, then, there were thirty thousand dollars in the case, and that was rather too much money to be lost for a principle; and so, after much considering, and asking advice from those that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew would advise to suit him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Brother B. wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) lawyer to dispose of the business in the way that seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) the most suitable, and remit the proceeds.
<p/>The day after the letter arrived in New Orleans, Susan and Emmeline were attached, and sent to the depot to await a general auction on the following morning; and as they glimmer faintly upon us in the moonlight which steals through the grated window, we may listen to their conversation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) didn't like trading in slaves and souls of men,--of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) didn't; Both are weeping, but each quietly, that the other may not hear.
<p/>Mother, just lay your head on my lap, and see if you can't sleep a little,'' says the girl, trying to appear calm.
<p/>'' '' I haven't any heart to sleep, Em ; I can't; it's the last night we may be together!'' <div class="bookquote">``O, mother, don't say so!
<p/>perhaps we shall get sold together,--who knows?''  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>'' If 't was anybody's else case, I should say so, too, Em,'' said the woman;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I'm so feard of losin' you that I don't see anything but the danger. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, mother, the man said we were both likely, and would sell well.
<p/>With a deadly sickness at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had looked at Emmeline's hands, and lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) curly hair, and pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a first-rate article.
<p/>Susan had been trained as a Christian, brought up in the daily reading of the Bible, and had the same horror of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) child's being sold to a life of shame that any other Christian mother might have; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had no hope,--no protection.
<p/>Mother, I think we might do first rate, if you could get a place as cook, and I as chambermaid or seamstress, in some family.
<p/>Let's both look as bright and lively as we can, and tell all we can do, and perhaps we shall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline.
<p/>'' Susan remembered the man's looks and words. '' I dare say we shall. '' I want you to brush your hair all back straight, tomorrow,'' said Susan.
<p/>'' What for, mother? I don't look near so well, that way.'' '' Yes, but you'll sell better so.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't see why!''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>said the child.
<p/>Respectable families would be more apt to buy you, if they saw you looked plain and decent, as if you wasn't trying to look handsome.
<p/>And, Emmeline, if we shouldn't ever see each other again, after tomorrow,--if I'm sold way up on a plantation somewhere, and you somewhere else,--always remember how you've been brought up, and all Missis has told you; take your Bible with you, and your hymn-book; and if you're faithful to the Lord, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll be faithful to you.
<p/>So speaks the poor soul, in sore discouragement; for she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knows that tomorrow any man, however vile and brutal, however godless and merciless, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only has money to pay for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), may become owner of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) daughter, body and soul; and then, how is the child to be faithful?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thinks of all this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) holds her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) daughter in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) arms, and wishes that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) were not handsome and attractive.
<p/>It seems almost an aggravation to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to remember how purely and piously, how much above the ordinary lot, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has been brought up.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has no resort but to pray ; and many such prayers to God have gone up from those same trim, neatly-arranged, respectable slave-prisons,--prayers which God has not forgotten, as a coming day shall show; for it is written,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Who causeth one of these little ones to offend, it were better for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that a millstone were hanged about his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) neck, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) were drowned in the depths of the sea.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>I know their ways better 'n you do,'' said Susan. '' Well, mother, then I will. '' '' '' ''
<p/>The soft, earnest, quiet moonbeam looks in fixedly, marking the bars of the grated windows on the prostrate, sleeping forms. The mother and daughter are singing together a wild and melancholy dirge, common as a funeral hymn among the slaves:
<p/>``O, where is weeping Mary? O, where is weeping Mary? ' Rived in the goodly land. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is dead and gone to Heaven; She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is dead and gone to Heaven; `Rived in the goodly land.
<p/>These words, sung by voices of a peculiar and melancholy sweetness, in an air which seemed like the sighing of earthy despair after heavenly hope, floated through the dark prison rooms with a pathetic cadence, as verse after verse was breathed out: <div class="bookquote">``O, where are Paul and Silas?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Paul</b></font>)</div>O, where are Paul and Silas? Gone to the goodly land. They are dead and gone to Heaven; They are dead and gone to Heaven; `Rived in the goodly land.
<p/>But now it is morning, and everybody is astir; and the worthy Mr. Skeggs is busy and bright, for a lot of goods is to be fitted out for auction.
<p/>There is a brisk lookout on the toilet; injunctions passed around to every one to put on their best face and be spry; and now all are arranged in a circle for a last review, before they are marched up to the Bourse.
<p/>Mr. Skeggs, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Skeggs</b></font>) palmetto on and his (<font color='blue'><b>Skeggs</b></font>) cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Skeggs</b></font>) mouth, walks around to put farewell touches on his (<font color='blue'><b>Skeggs</b></font>) wares.
<p/>'' Sing on poor souls! The night is short, and the morning will part you forever! '' How's this? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Skeggs</b></font>) said, stepping in front of Susan and Emmeline.
<p/>The girl looked timidly at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, who, with the smooth adroitness common among her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) class, answers, <div class="bookquote">``I was telling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), last night, to put up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair smooth and neat, and not havin' it flying about in curls; looks more respectable so.''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Where's your curls, gal? '' <div class="bookquote">``Bother! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, peremptorily, turning to the girl; <div class="bookquote">``you go right along, and curl yourself real smart!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, giving a crack to a rattan he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``And be back in quick time, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>You go and help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, to the mother. '' Them curls may make a hundred dollars difference in the sale of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>'' Beneath a splendid dome were men of all nations, moving to and fro, over the marble pave. On every side of the circular area were little tribunes, or stations, for the use of speakers and auctioneers.
<p/>Two of these, on opposite sides of the area, were now occupied by brilliant and talented gentlemen, enthusiastically forcing up, in English and French commingled, the bids of connoisseurs in their various wares.
<p/>A third one, on the other side, still unoccupied, was surrounded by a group, waiting the moment of sale to begin.
<p/>And here we may recognize the St. Clare servants,--Tom, Adolph, and others; and there, too, Susan and Emmeline, awaiting their turn with anxious and dejected faces.
<p/>Various spectators, intending to purchase, or not intending, examining, and commenting on their various points and faces with the same freedom that a set of jockeys discuss the merits of a horse.
<p/>Hulloa, Alf! what brings you here?'' said a young exquisite, slapping the shoulder of a sprucely-dressed young man, who was examining Adolph through an eye-glass.
<p/>'' '' Well! I was wanting a valet, and I heard that St. Clare's lot was going. I thought I'd just look at his (<font color='blue'><b>valet</b></font>)--''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Catch me ever buying any of St. Clare's people! Spoilt niggers, every one. Impudent as the devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the other. ''
<p/>If I get 'em, I'll soon have their airs out of them; they'll soon find that they've another kind of master to deal with than Monsieur St. Clare. '
<p/>Never fear that!'' said the first. '' Pon my word, I'll buy that fellow. I like the shape of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``You'll find it'll take all you've got to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s deucedly extravagant!''  (<font color='red'><b>lord</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but my lord will find that he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) can't be extravagant with me . Just let him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) be sent to the calaboose a few times, and thoroughly dressed down!
<p/>I'll tell you if it don't bring him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) to a sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) ways! O, I'll reform him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>), up hill and down,--you'll see.
<p/>Tom had been standing wistfully examining the multitude of faces thronging around him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), for one whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would wish to call master.
<p/>And if you should ever be under the necessity, sir, of selecting, out of two hundred men, one who was to become your absolute owner and disposer, you would, perhaps, realize, just as Tom did, how few there were that you would feel at all comfortable in being made over to.
<p/>Tom saw abundance of men,--great, burly, gruff men; little, chirping, dried men; long-favored, lank, hard men; and every variety of stubbed-looking, commonplace men, who pick up their fellow-men as one picks up chips, putting them into the fire or a basket with equal unconcern, according to their convenience; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw no St. Clare.
<p/>A little before the sale commenced, a short, broad, muscular man, in a checked shirt considerably open at the bosom, and pantaloons much the worse for dirt and wear, elbowed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way through the crowd, like one who is going actively into a business; and, coming up to the group, began to examine them systematically.
<p/>From the moment that Tom saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) approaching, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt an immediate and revolting horror at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), that increased as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came near.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) round, bullet head, large, light-gray eyes, with their shaggy, sandy eyebrows, and stiff, wiry, sun-burned hair, were rather unprepossessing items, it is to be confessed; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) large, coarse mouth was distended with tobacco, the juice of which, from time to time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ejected from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with great decision and explosive force; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands were immensely large, hairy, sun-burned, freckled, and very dirty, and garnished with long nails, in a very foul condition.
<p/>I buy him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), that's flat! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was evidently, though short, of gigantic strength. This man proceeded to a very free personal examination of the lot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized Tom by the jaw, and pulled open his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mouth to inspect his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) teeth; made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) strip up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sleeve, to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) muscle; turned him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) round, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) jump and spring, to show his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paces.
<p/>'' Where was you raised? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) added, briefly, to these investigations. '' In Kintuck, Mas`r,'' said Tom, looking about, as if for deliverance.
<p/>'' What have you done?'' <div class="bookquote">``Had care of Mas`r's farm,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom. '' Likely story!'' said the other, shortly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) passed on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) paused a moment before Dolph; then spitting a discharge of tobacco-juice on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) well-blacked boots, and giving a contemptuous umph, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walked on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heavy, dirty hand, and drew the girl towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); passed it over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neck and bust, felt her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) teeth, and then pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, whose patient face showed the suffering she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been going through at every motion of the hideous stranger.
<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) stopped before Susan and Emmeline. The girl was frightened, and began to cry. '' Stop that, you minx!'' said the salesman; ``no whimpering here,--the sale is going to begin.
<p/>Adolph was knocked off, at a good sum, to the young gentlemen who had previously stated his (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>) intention of buying him (<font color='blue'><b>Adolph</b></font>); and the other servants of the St. Clare lot went to various bidders.
<p/>Tom stepped upon the block, gave a few anxious looks round; all seemed mingled in a common, indistinct noise,--the clatter of the salesman crying off his (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) qualifications in French and English, the quick fire of French and English bids; and almost in a moment came the final thump of the hammer, and the clear ring on the last syllable of the word <div class="bookquote">``dollars,''  (<font color='red'><b>the salesman</b></font>)</div>as the auctioneer announced his (<font color='blue'><b>salesman</b></font>) price, and Tom was made over.--He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had a master!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was pushed from the block;--the short, bullet-headed man seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) roughly by the shoulder, pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to one side, saying, in a harsh voice, <div class="bookquote">``Stand there, you! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And accordingly the sale begun. '' Now, up with you, boy! d'ye hear?'' said the auctioneer to Tom. Tom hardly realized anything; but still the bidding went on,--ratting, clattering, now French, now English.
<p/>Down goes the hammer again,--Susan is sold! She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) goes down from the block, stops, looks wistfully back,--her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) daughter stretches her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) hands towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) looks with agony in the face of the man who has bought her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>),--a respectable middle-aged man, of benevolent countenance. ''
<p/>I'd like to, but I'm afraid I can't afford it!'' said the gentleman, looking, with painful interest, as the young girl mounted the block, and looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with a frightened and timid glance.
<p/>The blood flushes painfully in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) otherwise colorless cheek, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eye has a feverish fire, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother groans to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks more beautiful than she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ever saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) before.
<p/>O, Mas`r, please do buy my daughter!'' '' The auctioneer sees his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) advantage, and expatiates volubly in mingled French and English, and bids rise in rapid succession.
<p/>'' I'll do anything in reason,'' said the benevolent-looking gentleman, pressing in and joining with the bids. In a few moments they have run beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) purse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is silent; the auctioneer grows warmer; but bids gradually drop off. It lies now between an aristocratic old citizen and our bullet-headed acquaintance.
<p/>The citizen bids for a few turns, contemptuously measuring his (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) opponent; but the bullet-head has the advantage over him (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>), both in obstinacy and concealed length of purse, and the controversy lasts but a moment; the hammer falls,--he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) has got the girl, body and soul, unless God help her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is pushed along into the same lot with Tom and two other men, and goes off, weeping as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) goes.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) master is Mr. Legree, who owns a cotton plantation on the Red River. The benevolent gentleman is sorry; but, then, the thing happens every day!
<p/>One sees girls and mothers crying, at these sales, always! it can't be helped, &c.; and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) walks off, with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) acquisition, in another direction.
<p/>Two days after, the lawyer of the Christian firm of B. & Co., New York, send on their money to them.
<p/>On the reverse of that draft, so obtained, let them write these words of the great Paymaster, to whom they shall make up their account in a future day: <div class="bookquote">``When he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) maketh inquisition for blood, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) forgetteth not the cry of the humble!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look upon iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--HAB.
<p/>On the lower part of a small, mean boat, on the Red River, Tom sat,--chains on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wrists, chains on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feet, and a weight heavier than chains lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart.
<p/>All had faded from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sky,--moon and star; all had passed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), as the trees and banks were now passing, to return no more.
<p/>Kentucky home, with wife and children, and indulgent owners; St. Clare home, with all its refinements and splendors; the golden head of Eva, with its saint-like eyes; the proud, gay, handsome, seemingly careless, yet ever-kind St. Clare; hours of ease and indulgent leisure,--all gone!
<p/>It is one of the bitterest apportionments of a lot of slavery, that the negro, sympathetic and assimilative, after acquiring, in a refined family, the tastes and feelings which form the atmosphere of such a place, is not the less liable to become the bond-slave of the coarsest and most brutal,--just as a chair or table, which once decorated the superb saloon, comes, at last, battered and defaced, to the barroom of some filthy tavern, or some low haunt of vulgar debauchery.
<p/>The great difference is, that the table and chair cannot feel, and the man can; for even a legal enactment that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall be <div class="bookquote">``taken, reputed, adjudged in law, to be a chattel personal,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cannot blot out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, with its own private little world of memories, hopes, loves, fears, and desires.
<p/>Mr. Simon Legree, Tom's master, had purchased slaves at one place and another, in New Orleans, to the number of eight, and driven them, handcuffed, in couples of two and two, down to the good steamer Pirate, which lay at the levee, ready for a trip up the Red River.
<p/>Having got them fairly on board, and the boat being off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pirate</b></font>) came round, with that air of efficiency which ever characterized him (<font color='blue'><b>Pirate</b></font>), to take a review of them.
<p/>Stopping opposite to Tom, who had been attired for sale in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) best broadcloth suit, with well-starched linen and shining boots, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) briefly expressed himself as follows: ``Stand up.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take off that stock!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>and, as Tom, encumbered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fetters, proceeded to do it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), by pulling it, with no gentle hand, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neck, and putting it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>Legree now turned to Tom's trunk, which, previous to this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been ransacking, and, taking from it a pair of old pantaloons and dilapidated coat, which Tom had been wont to put on about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stable-work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, liberating Tom's hands from the handcuffs, and pointing to a recess in among the boxes, <div class="bookquote">``You go there, and put these on.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXI The Middle Passage 1: 13. and in place thereof, what remains? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Tom stood up. '' Tom obeyed, and in a few moments returned.
<p/>There,'' said the former, throwing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a pair of coarse, stout shoes, such as were common among the slaves, ``put these on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take off your boots,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Legree/Legree</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Legree. Tom did so. '' '' In Tom's hurried exchange, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not forgotten to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cherished Bible to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>It was well he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did so; for Mr. Legree, having refitted Tom's handcuffs, proceeded deliberately to investigate the contents of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pockets.
<p/>Several little trifles, which Tom had treasured, chiefly because they had amused Eva, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked upon with a contemptuous grunt, and tossed them over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shoulder into the river.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drew out a silk handkerchief, and put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own pocket. Tom's Methodist hymn-book, which, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hurry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had forgotten
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) now held up and turned over. Humph! pious, to be sure. So, what's yer name,--you belong to the church, eh?''
<p/>'' Yes, Mas`r,'' said Tom, firmly. '' Well, I'll soon have that out of you. I have none o' yer bawling, praying, singing niggers on my place; so remember.
<p/>Now, mind yourself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, with a stamp and a fierce glance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gray eye, directed at Tom, '' I'm your church now!
<p/>and, as if repeated by an invisible voice, came the words of an old prophetic scroll, as Eva had often read them to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),--<div class="bookquote">``Fear not!
<p/>You understand,--you've got to be as I say. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Something within the silent black man answered No! for I have redeemed thee.
<p/>I have called thee by name. Thou art MINE! '' But Simon Legree heard no voice. That voice is one he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) never shall hear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) took Tom's trunk, which contained a very neat and abundant wardrobe, to the forecastle, where it was soon surrounded by various hands of the boat.
<p/>With much laughing, at the expense of niggers who tried to be gentlemen, the articles very readily were sold to one and another, and the empty trunk finally put up at auction.
<p/>It was a good joke, they all thought, especially to see how Tom looked after his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) things, as they were going this way and that; and then the auction of the trunk, that was funnier than all, and occasioned abundant witticisms.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only glared for a moment on the downcast face of Tom, and walked off. This little affair being over, Simon sauntered up again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) property.
<p/>'' Now, Tom, I've relieved you of any extra baggage, you see. Take mighty good care of them clothes. It'll be long enough `fore you get more.
<p/>I go in for making niggers careful; one suit has to do for one year, on my place. '' Simon next walked up to the place where Emmeline was sitting, chained to another woman.
<p/>'' Well, my dear,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) said, chucking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) under the chin, <div class="bookquote">``keep up your spirits. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The involuntary look of horror, fright and aversion, with which the girl regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>), did not escape his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) eye.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) frowned fiercely. '' None o' your shines, gal! you's got to keep a pleasant face, when I speak to ye,--d'ye hear?
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) said, giving a shove to the mulatto woman to whom Emmeline was chained, ``don't you carry that sort of face!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I say, all on ye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) said retreating a pace or two back, <div class="bookquote">``look at me,--look at me,--look me right in the eye,-- straight , now!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>), stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) foot at every pause.
<p/>And you, you old yellow poco moonshine! '' You's got to look chipper, I tell ye!'' As by a fascination, every eye was now directed to the glaring greenish-gray eye of Simon.
<p/>'' Now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>), doubling his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) great, heavy fist into something resembling a blacksmith's hammer, <div class="bookquote">``d'ye see this fist? Heft it!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a blacksmith</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) said, bringing it down on Tom's hand. '' Look at these yer bones! Well, I tell ye this yer fist has got as hard as iron knocking down niggers .
<p/>I never see the nigger, yet, I couldn't bring down with one crack,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>), bringing his (<font color='blue'><b>nigger</b></font>) fist down so near to the face of Tom that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) winked and drew back.
<p/>I don't keep none o' yer cussed overseers; I does my own overseeing; and I tell you things is seen to.
<p/>'' You's every one on ye got to toe the mark, I tell ye; quick,--straight,--the moment I speak. That's the way to keep in with me.
<p/>Ye won't find no soft spot in me, nowhere. So, now, mind yerselves; for I don't show no mercy!'' The women involuntarily drew in their breath, and the whole gang sat with downcast, dejected faces.
<p/>That's the way I begin with my niggers,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) said, to a gentlemanly man, who had stood by him (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) during his (<font color='blue'><b>Ye</b></font>) speech.
<p/>Meanwhile, Simon turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) heel, and marched up to the bar of the boat for a dram. '' '' It's my system to begin strong,--just
<p/>let 'em know what to expect. '' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, looking upon him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) with the curiosity of a naturalist studying some out-of-the-way specimen.
<p/>I'm none o' yer gentlemen planters, with lily fingers, to slop round and be cheated by some old cuss of an overseer!
<p/>'' Yes, indeed. Just feel of my knuckles, now; look at my fist. Tell ye, sir, the flesh on 't has come jest like a stone, practising on nigger--feel on it.
<p/>The stranger applied his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) fingers to the implement in question, and simply said, '''T is hard enough; and, I suppose,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``practice has made your heart just like it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, I may say so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Simon, with a hearty laugh. '' I reckon there's as little soft in me as in any one going.
<p/>Tell you, nobody comes it over me! Niggers never gets round me, neither with squalling nor soft soap,--that's a fact. ''
<p/>I paid a little high for him (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>), tendin' him (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) for a driver and a managing chap; only get the notions out that he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s larnt by bein' treated as niggers never ought to be, he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'ll do prime!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have a fine lot there.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Real,''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Simon. '' There's that Tom, they telled me he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was suthin' uncommon. The yellow woman I got took in on.
<p/>I rayther think she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s sickly, but I shall put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) through for what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s worth ; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may last a year or two.
<p/>Use up, and buy more, 's my way;-makes you less trouble, and I'm quite sure it comes cheaper in the end;'' and Simon sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) glass.
<p/>I don't go for savin' niggers. '' And how long do they generally last?'' said the stranger. '' Well, donno; `cordin' as their constitution is.
<p/>I used to, when I fust begun, have considerable trouble fussin' with 'em and trying to make 'em hold out,--doctorin' on 'em up when they's sick, and givin' on 'em clothes and blankets, and what not, tryin' to keep 'em all sort o' decent and comfortable.
<p/>Stout fellers last six or seven years; trashy ones gets worked up in two or three. Law, 't wasn't no sort o' use; I lost money on 'em, and 't was heaps o' trouble.
<p/>Now, you see, I just put 'em straight through, sick or well. When one nigger's dead, I buy another; and I find it comes cheaper and easier, every way.
<p/>'' The stranger turned away, and seated himself beside a gentleman, who had been listening to the conversation with repressed uneasiness.
<p/>'' You must not take that fellow to be any specimen of Southern planters,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). '' I should hope not,'' said the young gentleman, with emphasis.
<p/>And yet your laws allow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to hold any number of human beings subject to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) absolute will, without even a shadow of protection; and, low as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is, you cannot say that there are not many such.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is a mean, low, brutal fellow!'' said the other. '' '' '' Well,'' said the other, <div class="bookquote">``there are also many considerate and humane men among planters.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``but, in my opinion, it is you considerate, humane men, that are responsible for all the brutality and outrage wrought by these wretches; because, if it were not for your sanction and influence, the whole system could not keep foothold for an hour.
<p/>If there were no planters except such as that one,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) finger to Legree, who stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) back to them, ``the whole thing would go down like a millstone.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You certainly have a high opinion of my good nature,''  (<font color='red'><b>the planter</b></font>)</div>said the planter, smiling, ``but I advise you not to talk quite so loud, as there are people on board the boat who might not be quite so tolerant to opinion as I am.
<p/>You had better wait till I get up to my plantation, and there you may abuse us all, quite at your leisure.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Granted,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man; It is your respectability and humanity that licenses and protects his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brutality.'' '' The young gentleman colored and smiled, and the two were soon busy in a game of backgammon.
<p/>Meanwhile, another conversation was going on in the lower part of the boat, between Emmeline and the mulatto woman with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was confined.
<p/>As was natural, they were exchanging with each other some particulars of their history. '' Who did you belong to?'' said Emmeline.
<p/>'' Well, my Mas'r was Mr. Ellis,--lived on Levee-street. P'raps you've seen the house.'' <div class="bookquote">``Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>) good to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline.
<p/>'' Mostly, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>) tuk sick. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>)'s lain sick, off and on, more than six months, and been orful oneasy. '
<p/>Pears like he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>) warnt willin' to have nobody rest, day or night; and got so curous, there couldn't nobody suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>). '
<p/>Pears like he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>) just grew crosser, every day; kep me up nights till I got farly beat out, and couldn't keep awake no longer; and cause I got to sleep, one night, Lors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>) talk so orful to me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>) tell me he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>)'d sell me to just the hardest master he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>) could find; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>)'d promised me my freedom, too, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ellis</b></font>) died.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Had you any friends?''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline. '' Yes, my husband,--he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)'s a blacksmith. Mas'r gen`ly hired him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) out. They took me off so quick, I didn't even have time to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and I's got four children.
<p/>It is a natural impulse, in every one, when they hear a tale of distress, to think of something to say by way of consolation.
<p/>O, dear me!'' said the woman, covering her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands. Emmeline wanted to say something, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not think of anything to say.
<p/>As by a common consent, they both avoided, with fear and dread, all mention of the horrible man who was now their master.
<p/>What was there to be said? True, there is religious trust for even the darkest hour. The mulatto woman was a member of the Methodist church, and had an unenlightened but very sincere spirit of piety.
<p/>Emmeline had been educated much more intelligently,--taught to read and write, and diligently instructed in the Bible, by the care of a faithful and pious mistress; yet, would it not try the faith of the firmest Christian, to find themselves abandoned, apparently, of God, in the grasp of ruthless violence?
<p/>The boat moved on,--freighted with its weight of sorrow,--up the red, muddy, turbid current, through the abrupt tortuous windings of the Red river; and sad eyes gazed wearily on the steep red-clay banks, as they glided by in dreary sameness.
<p/>How much more must it shake the faith of Christ's poor little ones, weak in knowledge and tender in years! At last the boat stopped at a small town, and Legree, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) party, disembarked.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXII Dark Places <div class="bookquote">``The dark places of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>* * Ps.
<p/>In the wagon was seated Simon Legree and the two women, still fettered together, were stowed away with some baggage in the back part of it, and the whole company were seeking Legree's plantation, which lay a good distance off.
<p/>It was a wild, forsaken road, now winding through dreary pine barrens, where the wind whispered mournfully, and now over log causeways, through long cypress swamps, the doleful trees rising out of the slimy, spongy ground, hung with long wreaths of funeral black moss, while ever and anon the loathsome form of the mocassin snake might be seen sliding among broken stumps and shattered branches that lay here and there, rotting in the water.
<p/>It is disconsolate enough, this riding, to the stranger, who, with well-filled pocket and well-appointed horse, threads the lonely way on some errand of business; but wilder, drearier, to the man enthralled, whom every weary step bears further from all that man loves and prays for.
<p/>So one should have thought, that witnessed the sunken and dejected expression on those dark faces; the wistful, patient weariness with which those sad eyes rested on object after object that passed them in their sad journey.
<p/>Simon rode on, however, apparently well pleased, occasionally pulling away at a flask of spirit, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) kept in his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>74:20. Trailing wearily behind a rude wagon, and over a ruder road, Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) associates faced onward. '' I say, you! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned back and caught a glance at the dispirited faces behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>The men looked at each other, and the '' come '' was repeated, with a smart crack of the whip which the driver carried in his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' Strike up a song, boys,--come!'' Tom began a Methodist hymn. '' Jerusalem, my happy home, Name ever dear to me!
<p/>'' Jerusalem, my happy home ,'' anonymous hymn dating from the latter part of the sixteenth century, sung to the tune of <div class="bookquote">``St. Stephen.
<p/>When shall my sorrows have an end, Thy joys when shall-- '' (<font color='red'><b>St. Augustine</b></font>)</div>* * '' Words derive from St. Augustine's Meditations .
<p/>'' Shut up, you black cuss! '' roared Legree; <div class="bookquote">``did ye think I wanted any o' yer infernal old Methodism? I say, tune up, now, something real rowdy,--quick!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the other men struck up one of those unmeaning songs, common among the slaves. ``Mas'r see'd me cotch a coon, High boys, high!
<p/>The singer appeared to make up the song to his (<font color='blue'><b>singer</b></font>) own pleasure, generally hitting on rhyme, without much attempt at reason; and the party took up the chorus, at intervals, <div class="bookquote">``Ho!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) laughed to split,--d'ye see the moon, Ho! ho! ho! boys, ho! Ho! yo! hi--e! oh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>ho! ho! boys, ho! High--
<p/>It was sung very boisterouly, and with a forced attempt at merriment; but no wail of despair, no words of impassioned prayer, could have had such a depth of woe in them as the wild notes of the chorus.
<p/>As if the poor, dumb heart, threatened,--prisoned,--took refuge in that inarticulate sanctuary of music, and found there a language in which to breathe its prayer to God!
<p/>e-- oh! high --e --oh!'' There was a prayer in it, which Simon could not hear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) only heard the boys singing noisily, and was well pleased; he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) was making them <div class="bookquote">``keep up their spirits.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, my little dear,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>), turning to Emmeline, and laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``we're almost home! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div><p/>When Legree scolded and stormed, Emmeline was terrified; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>), and spoke as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) now did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) had rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) would strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>).
<p/>The expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) eyes made her (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) soul sick, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) flesh creep. Involuntarily she (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) clung closer to the mulatto woman by her (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) side, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) were her (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) mother.
<p/>'' You didn't ever wear ear-rings,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) said, taking hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) small ear with his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) coarse fingers. '' No, Mas`r!
<p/>'' said Emmeline, trembling and looking down. '' Well, I'll give you a pair, when we get home, if you're a good girl.
<p/>You needn't be so frightened; I don't mean to make you work very hard. You'll have fine times with me, and live like
<p/>Legree had been drinking to that degree that he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was inclining to be very gracious; and it was about this time that the enclosures of the plantation rose to view.
<p/>The estate had formerly belonged to a gentleman of opulence and taste, who had bestowed some considerable attention to the adornment of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) grounds.
<p/>Having died insolvent, it had been purchased, at a bargain, by Legree, who used it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) did everything else, merely as an implement for money-making.
<p/>The place had that ragged, forlorn appearance, which is always produced by the evidence that the care of the former owner has been left to go to utter decay.
<p/>What was once a smooth-shaven lawn before the house, dotted here and there with ornamental shrubs, was now covered with frowsy tangled grass, with horseposts set up, here and there, in it, where the turf was stamped away, and the ground littered with broken pails, cobs of corn, and other slovenly remains.
<p/>Here and there, a mildewed jessamine or honeysuckle hung raggedly from some ornamental support, which had been pushed to one side by being used as a horse-post.
<p/>What once was a large garden was now all grown over with weeds, through which, here and there, some solitary exotic reared its forsaken head.
<p/>What had been a conservatory had now no window-shades, and on the mouldering shelves stood some dry, forsaken flower-pots, with sticks in them, whose dried leaves showed they had once been plants.
<p/>The wagon rolled up a weedy gravel walk, under a noble avenue of China trees, whose graceful forms and ever-springing foliage seemed to be the only things there that neglect could not daunt or alter,--like noble spirits, so deeply rooted in goodness, as to flourish and grow stronger amid discouragement and decay.
<p/>It was built in a manner common at the South; a wide verandah of two stories running round every part of the house, into which every outer door opened, the lower tier being supported by brick pillars.
<p/>But the place looked desolate and uncomfortable; some windows stopped up with boards, some with shattered panes, and shutters hanging by a single hinge,--all telling of coarse neglect and discomfort.
<p/>Bits of board, straw, old decayed barrels and boxes, garnished the ground in all directions; and three or four ferocious-looking dogs, roused by the sound of the wagon-wheels, came tearing out, and were with difficulty restrained from laying hold of Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) companions, by the effort of the ragged servants who came after them.
<p/>a lady,--only be a good girl. '' The house had been large and handsome. '' Ye see what ye'd get!'' said Legree, caressing the dogs with grim satisfaction, and turning to Tom and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) companions.
<p/>These yer dogs has been raised to track niggers; and they'd jest as soon chaw one on ye up as eat their supper.
<p/>How now, Sambo!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) said, to a ragged fellow, without any brim to his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) hat, who was officious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) attentions.
<p/>'' Ye see what ye'd get, if ye try to run off. So, mind yerself! '' How have things been going?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fust rate, Mas`r.''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quimbo,''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree to another, who was making zealous demonstrations to attract his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) attention, <div class="bookquote">``ye minded what I telled ye?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div><p/>Legree had trained them in savageness and brutality as systematically as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) bull-dogs; and, by long practice in hardness and cruelty, brought their whole nature to about the same range of capacities.
<p/>It is a common remark, and one that is thought to militate strongly against the character of the race, that the negro overseer is always more tyrannical and cruel than the white one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess I did, didn't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>These men</b></font>)</div>These two colored men were the two principal hands on the plantation. This is simply saying that the negro mind has been more crushed and debased than the white.
<p/>It is no more true of this race than of every oppressed race, the world over. The slave is always a tyrant, if he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) can get a chance to be one.
<p/>Sambo and Quimbo cordially hated each other; the plantation hands, one and all, cordially hated them; and, by playing off one against another
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) was pretty sure, through one or the other of the three parties, to get informed of whatever was on foot in the place.
<p/>Nobody can live entirely without social intercourse; and Legree encouraged his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) two black satellites to a kind of coarse familiarity with him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>),--a familiarity, however, at any moment liable to get one or the other of them into trouble; for, on the slightest provocation, one of them always stood ready, at a nod, to be a minister of his (<font color='blue'><b>minister</b></font>) vengeance on the other.
<p/>As they stood there now by Legree, they seemed an apt illustration of the fact that brutal men are lower even than animals.
<p/>Their coarse, dark, heavy features; their great eyes, rolling enviously on each other; their barbarous, guttural, half-brute intonation; their dilapidated garments fluttering in the wind,--were all in admirable keeping with the vile and unwholesome character of everything about the place.
<p/>Here, you Sambo,'' said Legree, <div class="bookquote">``take these yer boys down to the quarters; and here's a gal I've got for you ,''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) separated the mulatto woman from Emmeline, and pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>);--<div class="bookquote">``I promised to bring you one, you know.
<p/>Legree, like some potentates we read of in history, governed his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) plantation by a sort of resolution of forces. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>The woman gave a start, and drawing back, said, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``O, Mas`r! I left my old man in New Orleans.''  (<font color='red'><b>The woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What of that, you--; won't you want one here?
<p/>None o' your words,--go long!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) whip. <div class="bookquote">``Come, mistress,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) said to Emmeline, ``you go in here with me.
<p/>A dark, wild face was seen, for a moment, to glance at the window of the house; and, as Legree opened the door, a female voice said something, in a quick, imperative tone.
<p/>Tom, who was looking, with anxious interest, after Emmeline, as she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) went in, noticed this, and heard Legree answer, angrily, <div class="bookquote">``You may hold your tongue!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>I'll do as I please, for all you!'' Tom heard no more; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was soon following Sambo to the quarters.
<p/>The quarters was a little sort of street of rude shanties, in a row, in a part of the plantation, far off from the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been comforting himself with the thought of a cottage, rude, indeed, but one which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might make neat and quiet, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might have a shelf for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Bible, and a place to be alone out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) laboring hours.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked into several; they were mere rude shells, destitute of any species of furniture, except a heap of straw, foul with dirt, spread confusedly over the floor, which was merely the bare ground, trodden hard by the tramping of innumerable feet.
<p/>They had a forlorn, brutal, forsaken air. Tom's heart sunk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw them. '' Which of these will be mine?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), to Sambo, submissively.
<p/>Dunno; ken turn in here, I spose,'' said Sambo; <div class="bookquote">``spects thar's room for another thar; thar's a pretty smart heap o' niggers to each on 'em, now; sure, I dunno what I 's to do with more.
<p/>It was late in the evening when the weary occupants of the shanties came flocking home,--men and women, in soiled and tattered garments, surly and uncomfortable, and in no mood to look pleasantly on new-comers.
<p/>The small village was alive with no inviting sounds; hoarse, guttural voices contending at the hand-mills where their morsel of hard corn was yet to be ground into meal, to fit it for the cake that was to constitute their only supper.
<p/>From the earliest dawn of the day, they had been in the fields, pressed to work under the driving lash of the overseers; for it was now in the very heat and hurry of the season, and no means was left untried to press every one up to the top of their capabilities.
<p/>And it isn't much inconvenience, either, to have one drop of water fall on your head; yet the worst torture of the inquisition is produced by drop after drop, drop after drop, falling moment after moment, with monotonous succession, on the same spot; and work, in itself
<p/>not hard, becomes so, by being pressed, hour after hour, with unvarying, unrelenting sameness, with not even the consciousness of free-will to take from its tediousness.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sambo</b></font>)</div>'' '' True,'' says the negligent lounger; <div class="bookquote">``picking cotton isn't hard work. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Isn't it? Tom looked in vain among the gang, as they poured along, for companionable faces.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw only sullen, scowling, imbruted men, and feeble, discouraged women, or women that were not women,--the strong pushing away the weak,--the gross, unrestricted animal selfishness of human beings, of whom nothing good was expected and desired; and who, treated in every way like brutes, had sunk as nearly to their level as it was possible for human beings to do.
<p/>To a late hour in the night the sound of the grinding was protracted; for the mills were few in number compared with the grinders, and the weary and feeble ones were driven back by the strong, and came on last in their turn.
<p/>Ho yo!'' said Sambo, coming to the mulatto woman, and throwing down a bag of corn before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``what a cuss yo name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Lucy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. '' Wal, Lucy, yo my woman now. Yo grind dis yer corn, and get my supper baked, ye har?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I an't your woman, and I won't be! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, with the sharp, sudden courage of despair; <div class="bookquote">``you go `long!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'll kick yo, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>Sambo</b></font>)</div>said Sambo, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) foot threateningly. '' Ye may kill me, if ye choose,--the sooner the better!
<p/>I say, Sambo, you go to spilin' the hands, I'll tell Mas'r o' you,'' said Quimbo, who was busy at the mill, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) had viciously driven two or three tired women, who were waiting to grind their corn.
<p/>Wish't I was dead!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>). '' '' And, I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) ye won't let the women come to the mills, yo old nigger!'' said Sambo.
<p/>'' Yo jes keep to yo own row. '' Tom was hungry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) day's journey, and almost faint for want of food.
<p/>Thar, yo!'' said Quimbo, throwing down a coarse bag, which contained a peck of corn; <div class="bookquote">``thar, nigger, grab, take car on `t,--yo won't get no more, dis yer week.
<p/>Tom waited till a late hour, to get a place at the mills; and then, moved by the utter weariness of two women, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw trying to grind their corn there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ground for them, put together the decaying brands of the fire, where many had baked cakes before them, and then went about getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own supper.
<p/>It was a new kind of work there,--a deed of charity, small as it was; but it woke an answering touch in their hearts,--an expression of womanly kindness came over their hard faces; they mixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cake for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and tended its baking; and Tom sat down by the light of the fire, and drew out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Bible,--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had need for comfort.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Quimbo</b></font>)</div>'' '' What's that?'' said one of the woman. '' A Bible,'' said Tom. '' Good Lord! han't seen un since I was in Kentuck.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Was you raised in Kentuck?''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with interest. '' Yes, and well raised, too; never `spected to come to dis yer!
<p/>'' said the woman, sighing. '' What's dat ar book, any way?'' said the other woman. '' Why, the Bible. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laws a me! what's dat?''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. '' Do tell! you never hearn on `t? '' said the other woman.
<p/>'' I used to har Missis a readin' on `t, sometimes, in Kentuck; but, laws o' me! we don't har nothin' here
<p/>but crackin' and swarin'. '' <div class="bookquote">``Read a piece, anyways!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the first woman, curiously, seeing Tom attentively poring over it. Tom read,--<div class="bookquote">``Come unto Me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>'' Them's good words, enough,'' said the woman; <div class="bookquote">``who says 'em? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>'' The Lord,'' said Tom. '' I jest wish I know'd whar to find Him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),'' said the woman.
<p/>My flesh is fairly sore, and I tremble all over, every day, and Sambo's allers a jawin' at me, 'cause I doesn't pick faster; and nights it's most midnight `fore
<p/>'' I would go; `pears like I never should get rested again. I can get my supper; and den `pears like I don't turn over and shut my eyes, `fore
<p/>I hear de horn blow to get up, and at it agin in de mornin'. If I knew whar de Lor was, I'd tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>).''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>)'s here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>)'s everywhere,'' said Tom. '' Lor, you an't gwine to make me believe dat ar! I know de Lord an't here,'' said the woman; ''`tan't no use talking, though.
<p/>The women went off to their cabins, and Tom sat alone, by the smouldering fire, that flickered up redly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face.
<p/>The silver, fair-browed moon rose in the purple sky, and looked down, calm and silent, as God looks on the scene of misery and oppression,--looked calmly on the lone black man, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms folded, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Bible on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knee.
<p/>Ah, how is it possible for the untaught heart to keep its faith, unswerving, in the face of dire misrule, and palpable, unrebuked injustice?
<p/>In that simple heart waged a fierce conflict; the crushing sense of wrong, the foreshadowing, of a whole life of future misery, the wreck of all past hopes, mournfully tossing in the soul's sight, like dead corpses of wife, and child, and friend, rising from the dark wave, and surging in the face of the half-drowned mariner!
<p/>Ah, was it easy here to believe and hold fast the great password of Christian faith, that <div class="bookquote">``God IS, and is the REWARDER of them that diligently seek Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>?
<p/>I's jest gwine to camp down, and sleep while I ken. '' '' Is God HERE? '' Tom rose, disconsolate, and stumbled into the cabin that had been allotted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>The floor was already strewn with weary sleepers, and the foul air of the place almost repelled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); but the heavy night-dews were chill, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) limbs weary, and, wrapping about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a tattered blanket, which formed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only bed-clothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stretched himself in the straw and fell asleep.
<p/>In dreams, a gentle voice came over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ear; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was sitting on the mossy seat in the garden by Lake Pontchartrain, and Eva, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) serious eyes bent downward, was reading to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from the Bible; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) read.
<p/>When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee, and the rivers they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee; for I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy Saviour.
<p/>Gradually the words seemed to melt and fade, as in a divine music; the child raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) deep eyes, and fixed them lovingly on him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>), and rays of warmth and comfort seemed to go from them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) heart; and, as if wafted on the music, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) seemed to rise on shining wings, from which flakes and spangles of gold fell off like stars, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eva</b></font>) was gone.
<p/>But who shall say that that sweet young spirit, which in life so yearned to comfort and console the distressed, was forbidden of God to assume this ministry after death?
<p/>'' '' Tom woke. Was it a dream? Let it pass for one. It is a beautiful belief, That ever round our head Are hovering, on angel wings,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they had no comforter.'' (<font color='red'><b>angel</b></font>)</div>--ECCL.
<p/>It took but a short time to familiarize Tom with all that was to be hoped or feared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new way of life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was an expert and efficient workman in whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) undertook; and was, both from habit and principle, prompt and faithful.
<p/>Quiet and peaceable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) disposition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hoped, by unremitting diligence, to avert from himself at least a portion of the evils of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) condition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw enough of abuse and misery to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sick and weary; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) determined to toil on, with religious patience, committing himself to Him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that judgeth righteously, not without hope that some way of escape might yet be opened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rated him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as a first-class hand; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt a secret dislike to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>),--the native antipathy of bad to good.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw, plainly, that when, as was often the case, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) violence and brutality fell on the helpless, Tom took notice of it; for, so subtle is the atmosphere of opinion, that it will make itself felt, without words; and the opinion even of a slave may annoy a master.
<p/>Tom in various ways manifested a tenderness of feeling, a commiseration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fellow-sufferers, strange and new to them, which was watched with a jealous eye by Legree.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had purchased Tom with a view of eventually making him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) a sort of overseer, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might, at times, intrust his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) affairs, in short absences; and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) view, the first, second, and third requisite for that place, was hardness .
<p/>Legree made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mind, that, as Tom was not hard to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would harden him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forthwith; and some few weeks after Tom had been on the place, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) determined to commence the process.
<p/>One morning, when the hands were mustered for the field, Tom noticed, with surprise, a new comer among them, whose appearance excited his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) attention.
<p/>It was a woman, tall and slenderly formed, with remarkably delicate hands and feet, and dressed in neat and respectable garments.
<p/>By the appearance of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might have been between thirty-five and forty; and it was a face that, once seen, could never be forgotten,--one of those that, at a glance, seem to convey to us an idea of a wild, painful, and romantic history.
<p/>The spirits of the dead. CHAPTER XXXIII Cassy 4:1 Legree took a silent note of Tom's availability. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) forehead was high, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyebrows marked with beautiful clearness.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) straight, well-formed nose, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) finely-cut mouth, and the graceful contour of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and neck, showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must once have been beautiful; but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face was deeply wrinkled with lines of pain, and of proud and bitter endurance.
<p/>But her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye was the most remarkable feature,--so large, so heavily black, overshadowed by long lashes of equal darkness, and so wildly, mournfully despairing.
<p/>There was a fierce pride and defiance in every line of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, in every curve of the flexible lip, in every motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body; but in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye was a deep, settled night of anguish,--an expression so hopeless and unchanging as to contrast fearfully with the scorn and pride expressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whole demeanor.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) complexion was sallow and unhealthy, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks thin, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features sharp, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whole form emaciated. Where she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came from, or who she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was, Tom did not know.
<p/>The first he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did know, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was walking by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side, erect and proud, in the dim gray of the dawn.
<p/>To the gang, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was known; for there was much looking and turning of heads, and a smothered yet apparent exultation among the miserable, ragged, half-starved creatures by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was surrounded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Got to come to it, at last,--glad of it!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said one. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)! he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)!'' said another; <div class="bookquote">``you'll know how good it is, Misse!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We'll see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'ll get a cutting up, at night, like the rest of us!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'd be glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) down for a flogging, I'll bound!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said another.
<p/>The woman took no notice of these taunts, but walked on, with the same expression of angry scorn, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard nothing.
<p/>Tom had always lived among refined, and cultivated people, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt intuitively, from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) air and bearing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) belonged to that class; but how or why she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could be fallen to those degrading circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could not tell.
<p/>The women neither looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) nor spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), though, all the way to the field, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kept close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) side.
<p/>Tom was soon busy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) work; but, as the woman was at no great distance from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) often glanced an eye to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw, at a glance, that a native adroitness and handiness made the task to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) an easier one than it proved to many.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) picked very fast and very clean, and with an air of scorn, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) despised both the work and the disgrace and humiliation of the circumstances in which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was placed.
<p/>In the course of the day, Tom was working near the mulatto woman who had been bought in the same lot with himself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was evidently in a condition of great suffering, and Tom often heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) praying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wavered and trembled, and seemed about to fall down.
<p/>Tom silently as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came near to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), transferred several handfuls of cotton from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own sack to hers. '' O, don't, don't!'' said the woman, looking surprised; <div class="bookquote">``it'll get you into trouble.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Just then Sambo came up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) seemed to have a special spite against this woman; and, flourishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) whip, said, in brutal, guttural tones,
<p/>' a''' and, with the word, kicking the woman with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) heavy cowhide shoe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) struck Tom across the face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) whip.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What dis yer, Luce,--foolin Tom silently resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) task; but the woman, before at the last point of exhaustion, fainted. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I'll give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) something better than camphire!'' and, taking a pin from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coat-sleeve, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) buried it to the head in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flesh.
<p/>I'll bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to!'' said the driver, with a brutal grin. '' The woman groaned, and half rose. '' Get up, you beast, and work, will yer, or I'll show yer a trick more!''
<p/>The woman seemed stimulated, for a few moments, to an unnatural strength, and worked with desperate eagerness. '' See that you keep to dat ar,'' said the man, <div class="bookquote">``or yer'll wish yer's dead tonight, I reckin!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``That I do now!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Tom heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say; and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``O, Lord, how long! O, Lord, why don't you help us?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>At the risk of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) might suffer, Tom came forward again, and put all the cotton in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sack into the woman's.
<p/>'' O, you mustn't! you donno what they'll do to ye!'' said the woman. '' I can bar it!'' said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``better 'n you;''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) place again.
<p/>Suddenly, the stranger woman whom we have described, and who had, in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work, come near enough to hear Tom's last words, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heavy black eyes, and fixed them, for a second, on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); then, taking a quantity of cotton from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) basket, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) placed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>When you've been here a month, you'll be done helping anybody; you'll find it hard enough to take care of your own skin!''
<p/>It passed in a moment. '' You know nothing about this place,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``or you wouldn't have done that. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The Lord forbid, Missis!'' said Tom, using instinctively to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) field companion the respectful form proper to the high bred with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had lived.
<p/>The Lord never visits these parts,'' said the woman, bitterly, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went nimbly forward with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work; and again the scornful smile curled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips.
<p/>But the action of the woman had been seen by the driver, across the field; and, flourishing his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whip, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' What! what!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) said to the woman, with an air of triumph, <div class="bookquote">``You a foolin'? Go along! yer under me
<p/>A glance like sheet-lightning suddenly flashed from those black eyes; and, facing about, with quivering lip and dilated nostrils, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew herself up, and fixed a glance, blazing with rage and scorn, on the driver.
<p/>now,--mind yourself, or yer'll cotch it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dog!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``touch me , if you dare!

<p/>I've only to say the word!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' What de devil you here for, den? '' said the man, evidently cowed, and sullenly retreating a step or two.
<p/>And, in truth, the man seemed greatly inclined to attend to something at the other end of the field, and started off in quick time.
<p/>'' Didn't mean no harm, Misse Cassy!'' <div class="bookquote">``Keep your distance, then!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman. The woman suddenly turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work, and labored with a despatch that was perfectly astonishing to Tom.
<p/>Before the day was through, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) basket was filled, crowded down, and piled, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had several times put largely into Tom's.
<p/>Long after dusk, the whole weary train, with their baskets on their heads, defiled up to the building appropriated to the storing and weighing the cotton.
<p/>Dat ar Tom's gwine to make a powerful deal o' trouble; kept a puttin' into Lucy's basket.--One o' these yer dat will get all der niggers to feelin' `bused, if Masir don't watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)!'' said Sambo.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) seemed to work by magic. Legree was there, busily conversing with the two drivers. '' '' Hey-dey! The black cuss!'' said Legree.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)'ll have to get a breakin' in, won't he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), boys?'' Both negroes grinned a horrid grin, at this intimation. ''
<p/>Ay, ay! Let Mas'r Legree alone, for breakin' in! De debil heself couldn't beat Mas'r at dat!'' said Quimbo. '' Wal, boys, the best way is to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) the flogging to do, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) gets over his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) notions.
<p/>Break him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) in!'' <div class="bookquote">``Lord, Mas`r'll have hard work to get dat out o' him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)!''

(<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) tobacco in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>'' Now, dar's Lucy,--de aggravatinest, ugliest wench on de place!'' pursued Sambo. '' Take care, Sam; I shall begin to think what's the reason for your spite agin Lucy.''
<p/>I'd a flogged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) into `t,'' said Legree, spitting, <div class="bookquote">``only there's such a press o' work, it don't seem wuth a while to upset her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) jist now.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wal, Lucy was real aggravatin' and lazy, sulkin' round; wouldn't do nothin,--and Tom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stuck up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).''

<p/>Wal, then, Tom shall have the pleasure of flogging her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). It'll be a good practice for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) won't put it on to the gal like you devils, neither.''
<p/>'' laughed both the sooty wretches; and the diabolical sounds seemed, in truth, a not unapt expression of the fiendish character which Legree gave them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ho, ho! haw! haw! haw! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Wal, but, Mas`r, Tom and Misse Cassy, and dey among 'em, filled Lucy's basket. I ruther guess der weight 's in it, Mas`r!''
<p/>'' I do the weighing! '' said Legree, emphatically. Both the drivers again laughed their diabolical laugh. '' So!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``Misse Cassy did her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) day's work.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) picks like de debil and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) angels!'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)'s got 'em all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), I believe! '' said Legree; and, growling a brutal oath, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) proceeded to the weighing-room.
<p/>Slowly the weary, dispirited creatures, wound their way into the room, and, with crouching reluctance, presented their baskets to be weighed.
<p/>Tom's basket was weighed and approved; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looked, with an anxious glance, for the success of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had befriended.
<p/>Legree noted on a slate, on the side of which was pasted a list of names, the amount. Tottering with weakness, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came forward, and delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) basket.
<p/>It was of full weight, as Legree well perceived; but, affecting anger, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``What, you lazy beast! short again! stand aside, you'll catch it, pretty soon!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The woman gave a groan of utter despair, and sat down on a board. The person who had been called Misse Cassy now came forward, and, with a haughty, negligent air, delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) basket.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) delivered it, Legree looked in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes with a sneering yet inquiring glance. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) black eyes steadily on him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips moved slightly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said something in French.
<p/>What it was, no one knew; but Legree's face became perfectly demoniacal in its expression, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke; he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) half raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hand, as if to strike,--a gesture which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) regarded with fierce disdain, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned and walked away.
<p/>I didn't buy ye jest for the common work; I mean to promote ye, and make a driver of ye; and tonight ye may jest as well begin to get yer hand in.
<p/>'' And now,'' said Legree, <div class="bookquote">``come here, you Tom. You see, I telled ye Now, ye jest take this yer gal and flog her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>); ye've seen enough on't to know how.''

<p/>a heavy blow cross the cheek, and following up the infliction by a shower of blows. '' There!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) stopped to rest; <div class="bookquote">``now, will ye tell me ye can't do it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I'm willin' to work, night and day, and work while there's life and breath in me; but this yer thing I can't feel it right to do;--and, Mas`r, I never shall do it,-- never !''
<p/>Tom had a remarkably smooth, soft voice, and a habitually respectful manner, that had given Legree an idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) would be cowardly, and easily subdued.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) spoke these last words, a thrill of amazement went through every one; the poor woman clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, and said, <div class="bookquote">``O Lord!''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>and every one involuntarily looked at each other and drew in their breath, as if to prepare for the storm that was about to burst.
<p/>'' Yes, Mas`r,'' said Tom, putting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, to wipe the blood, that trickled down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face. '' Legree looked stupefied and confounded; but at last burst forth,--``What!
<p/>ye blasted black beast! tell me ye don't think it right to do what I tell ye! What have any of you cussed cattle to do with thinking what's right?
<p/>I'll put a stop to it! Why, what do ye think ye are? May be ye think ye'r a gentleman master, Tom, to be a telling your master
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so, Mas`r,''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``the poor crittur's sick and feeble; 't would be downright cruel, and it's what I never will do, nor begin to.

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/>what's right, and what ain't! So you pretend it's wrong to flog the gal!'' Mas'r Tom spoke in a mild voice, but with a decision that could not be mistaken.
<p/>Legree shook with anger; his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) greenish eyes glared fiercely, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) very whiskers seemed to curl with passion; but, like some ferocious beast, that plays with its victim before he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) devours it, he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) kept back his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) strong impulse to proceed to immediate violence, and broke out into bitter raillery.
<p/>Well, here's a pious dog, at last, let down among us sinners!--a saint, a gentleman, and no less, to talk to us sinners about our sins!
<p/>Here, you rascal, you make believe to be so pious,--didn't you never hear, out of yer Bible, `Servants, obey yer masters'?
<p/>'' Powerful holy critter, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must be! An't I yer master? Didn't I pay down twelve hundred dollars, cash, for all there is inside yer old cussed black shell?
<p/>An't yer mine, now, body and soul? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, giving Tom a violent kick with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heavy boot; <div class="bookquote">``tell me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/>In the very depth of physical suffering, bowed by brutal oppression, this question shot a gleam of joy and triumph through Tom's soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suddenly stretched himself up, and, looking earnestly to heaven, while the tears and blood that flowed down his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face mingled, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``No! no! no!
<p/>It's been bought and paid for, by one that is able to keep it;--no matter, no matter, you can't harm me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>my soul an't yours, Mas`r! You haven't bought it,--ye can't buy it! <div class="bookquote">``I can't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, with a sneer; <div class="bookquote">``we'll see,--we'll see!
<p/>The two gigantic negroes that now laid hold of Tom, with fiendish exultation in their faces, might have formed no unapt personification of powers of darkness.
<p/>The poor woman screamed with apprehension, and all rose, as by a general impulse, while they dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) unresisting from the place.

<p/>And behold the tears of such as are oppressed; and on the side of their oppressors there was power. Wherefore I praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive.--ECCL.
<p/>It was late at night, and Tom lay groaning and bleeding alone, in an old forsaken room of the gin-house, among pieces of broken machinery, piles of damaged cotton, and other rubbish which had there accumulated.
<p/>The night was damp and close, and the thick air swarmed with myriads of mosquitos, which increased the restless torture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wounds; whilst a burning thirst--a torture beyond all others--filled up the uttermost measure of physical anguish.
<p/>4:1. '' O, good Lord! Do look down,--give me the victory!--give me the victory over all! '' prayed poor Tom, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) anguish.
<p/>A footstep entered the room, behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and the light of a lantern flashed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes. '' Who's there? O, for the Lord's massy, please give me some water!
<p/>The woman Cassy--for it was she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>),--set down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lantern, and, pouring water from a bottle, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) head, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) drink.
<p/>'' Another and another cup were drained, with feverish eagerness. '' Drink all ye want,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I knew how it would be.

<p/>Stiff with wounds and bruises, Tom was a long time in accomplishing this movement; but, when done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt a sensible relief from the cooling application to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wounds.
<p/>The woman, whom long practice with the victims of brutality had made familiar with many healing arts, went on to make many applications to Tom's wounds, by means of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was soon somewhat relieved.
<p/>Now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the woman, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head on a roll of damaged cotton, which served for a pillow, <div class="bookquote">``there's the best I can do for you.

<p/>and, had not human weakness and physical agony whispered that, before? '' O Lord! O Lord! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) groaned, <div class="bookquote">``how can I give up?''

<p/>Here you are, on a lone plantation, ten miles from any other, in the swamps; not a white person here, who could testify, if you were burned

<p/>There's no law here, of God or man, that can do you, or any one of us, the least good; and, this man!
<p/>I could make any one's hair rise, and their teeth chatter, if I should only tell what I've seen and been knowing to,
<p/>there's no earthly thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s too good to do. here,--and it's no use resisting! Did I want to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?

And yet, I've lived with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), these five years, and cursed every moment of my life,--night and day!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) good mistress taught her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to read the Bible; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s brought her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Bible here--to hell with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!''--and the woman laughed a wild and doleful laugh, that rung, with a strange, supernatural sound, through the old ruined shed.

<p/>There was a silence, a while, in which the breathing of both parties could be heard, when Tom faintly said, <div class="bookquote">``O, please, Missis!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/>Please, Missis, I saw 'em throw my coat in that ar' corner, and in my coat-pocket is my Bible;--if Missis would please get it for me.
<p/>The woman suddenly rose up, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face composed to its usual stern, melancholy expression. '' '' Cassy went and got it.
<p/>Tom opened, at once, to a heavily marked passage, much worn, of the last scenes in the life of Him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) by whose stripes we are healed.
<p/>'' If Missis would only be so good as read that ar',--it's better than water. '' Cassy took the book, with a dry, proud air, and looked over the passage.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) then read aloud, in a soft voice, and with a beauty of intonation that was peculiar, that touching account of anguish and of glory.
<p/>Often, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) read, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice faltered, and sometimes failed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) altogether, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would stop, with an air of frigid composure, till she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had mastered herself.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to the touching words, <div class="bookquote">``Father forgive them, for they know not what they do,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threw down the book, and, burying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face in the heavy masses of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sobbed aloud, with a convulsive violence.

<p/>Ye said the Lord took sides against us, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lets us be `bused and knocked round; but ye see what come on his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own Son,--the blessed Lord of Glory,--wan't he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) allays poor?

<p/>Well, I was brought up in luxury; the first I remember is, playing about, when I was a child, in splendid parlors,--when I was kept dressed up like a doll, and company and visitors used to praise me.
<p/>There was a garden opening from the saloon windows; and there I used to play hide-and-go-seek, under the orange-trees, with my brothers and sisters.
<p/>I went to a convent, and there I learned music, French and embroidery, and what not; and when I was fourteen, I came out to my father's funeral.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died very suddenly, and when the property came to be settled, they found that there was scarcely enough to cover the debts; and when the creditors took an inventory of the property, I was set down in it.
<p/>My mother was a slave woman, and my father had always meant to set me free; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not done it, and so I was set down in the list.
<p/>I'd always known who I was, but never thought much about it. Nobody ever expects that a strong, healthy man is going to die.
<p/>My father was a well man only four hours before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) died;--it was one of the first cholera cases in New Orleans.
<p/>The day after the funeral, my father's wife took her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) children, and went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father's plantation. I thought they treated me strangely, but didn't know.
<p/>There was a young lawyer who they left to settle the business; and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) came every day, and was about the house, and spoke very politely to me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), one day, a young man, whom I thought the handsomest I had ever seen. I shall never forget that evening.
<p/>I was lonesome and full of sorrow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was so kind and gentle to me; and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had seen me before I went to the convent, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had loved me a great while, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would be my friend and protector;--in short, though he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) didn't tell me, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had paid two thousand dollars for me, and I was his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) property,--I became his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) willingly, for I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>).
<p/>I walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) in the garden. Loved!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said the woman, stopping. '' O, how I did love that man! How I love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now,--and always shall, while I breathe!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so beautiful, so high, so noble! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put me into a beautiful house, with servants, horses, and carriages, and furniture, and dresses.
<p/>Everything that money could buy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave me; but I didn't set any value on all that,--I only cared for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) better than my God and my own soul, and, if I tried, I couldn't do any other way from what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted me to.
<p/>I thought, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved me as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, and if I was what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to think I was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be willing to marry me and set me free.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) convinced me that it would be impossible; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told me that, if we were only faithful to each other, it was marriage before God.
<p/>'' I wanted only one thing--I did want him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to marry me. If that is true, wasn't I that man's wife?
<p/>Wasn't I faithful? For seven years, didn't I study every look and motion, and only live and breathe to please him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>I alone,--and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) medicine, and did everything for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good angel, and said I'd saved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the yellow fever, and for twenty days and nights I watched with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). We had two beautiful children. The first was a boy, and we called him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Henry.
<p/>had such beautiful eyes, such a forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hair hung all in curls around it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's spirit, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) talent, too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used to tell me that I was the most beautiful woman in Louisiana, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was so proud of me and the children.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used to love to have me dress them up, and take them and me about in an open carriage, and hear the remarks that people would make on us; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) used to fill my ears constantly with the fine things that were said in praise of me and the children.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father,--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) Little Elise, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, looked like me. O, those were happy days! I thought I was as happy as any one could be; but then there came evil times.
<p/>from the first time I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), I couldn't tell why, I dreaded him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); for I felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going to bring misery on us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got Henry to going out with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and often he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would not come home nights till two or three o'clock.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had a cousin come to New Orleans, who was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) particular friend,--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thought all the world of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>);--but, I did not dare say a word
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to the gaming-houses; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was one of the sort that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) once got a going there, there was no holding back.
<p/>; for Henry was so high spirited, I was afraid to. And then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to another lady, and I saw soon that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heart was gone from me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) never told me, but I saw it,--I knew it, day after day,--I felt my heart breaking, but I could not say a word!
<p/>At this, the wretch offered to buy me and the children of Henry, to clear off his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) gambling debts, which stood in the way of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) marrying as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
<p/>wished;--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sold us . He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) told me, one day, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had business in the country, and should be gone two or three weeks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spoke kinder than usual, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should come back; but it didn't deceive me. I knew that the time had come
<p/>; I was just like one turned into stone; I couldn't speak, nor shed a tear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) kissed me and kissed the children, a good many times, and went out.
<p/>I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) get on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) horse, and I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was quite out of sight; and then I fell down, and fainted.
<p/>'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) came, the cursed wretch! he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) came to take possession. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had bought me and my children; and showed me the papers.
<p/>'' ''`Just as you please,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>); `but, if you don't behave reasonably, I'll sell both the children, where you shall never see them again.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) told me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) always had meant to have me, from the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw me; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had drawn Henry on, and got him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in debt, on purpose to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) willing to sell me.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) got him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in love with another woman; and that I might know, after all that, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should not give up for a few airs and tears, and things of that sort.
<p/>I cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) before God, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) I'd die sooner than live with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). '' I gave up, for my hands were tied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had my children;--whenever I resisted his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will anywhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would talk about selling them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made me as submissive as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) desired.
<p/>O, what a life it was! to live with my heart breaking, every day,--to keep on, on, on, loving, when it was only misery; and to be bound, body and soul, to one I hated.
<p/>I used to love to read to Henry, to play to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), to waltz with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and sing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>); but everything I did for this one was a perfect drag,--yet
<p/>Elise was a timid little thing; but Henry was bold and high-spirited, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had never been brought under, in the least, by any one.
<p/>I was afraid to refuse anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was very imperious, and harsh to the children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was always finding fault, and quarrelling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>); and I used to live in daily fear and dread.
<p/>I tried to make the child respectful;--I tried to keep them apart, for I held on to those children like death; but it did no good.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sold both those children . He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) took me to ride, one day, and when I came home, they were nowhere to be found!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had sold them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) showed me the money, the price of their blood. Then it seemed as if all good forsook me.
<p/>I raved and cursed,--cursed God and man; and, for a while, I believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) really was afraid of me. But he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) didn't give up so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told me that my children were sold, but whether I ever saw their faces again, depended on him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and that, if I wasn't quiet, they should smart for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made me submit; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made me be peaceable; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) flattered me with hopes that, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would buy them back; and so things went on, a week or two.
<p/>One day, I was out walking, and passed by the calaboose; I saw a crowd about the gate, and heard a child's voice,--and
<p/>suddenly my Henry broke away from two or three men who were holding him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and ran, screaming, and caught my dress.
<p/>They came up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), swearing dreadfully; and one man, whose face I shall never forget, told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wouldn't get away so; that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the calaboose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d get a lesson there
<p/>I tried to beg and plead,--they only laughed; the poor boy screamed and looked into my face, and held on to me, until, in tearing him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) off, they tore the skirt of my dress half away; and they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in, screaming `Mother!
<p/>Well, you can do anything with a woman, when you've got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children. he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)'d never forget. mother! mother!' There was one man stood there seemed to pity me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and said that the boy had been impudent and disobedient, ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going to break him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in, once for all.
<p/>I offered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all the money I had, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'d only interfere. I turned and ran; and every step of the way, I thought that I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scream.
<p/>I got into the house; ran, all out of breath, to the parlor, where I found Butler. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>), and begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) to go and interfere.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) only laughed, and told me the boy had got his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) deserts. He (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>)'d got to be broken in,--the sooner the better; `what did I expect?'
<p/>I remember seeing a great sharp bowie-knife on the table; I remember something about catching it, and flying upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>); and then all grew dark, and I didn't know any more,--not for days and days.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) asked. '' It seemed to me something in my head snapped, at that moment. I felt dizzy and furious. ''
<p/>An old black woman tended me; and a doctor came to see me, and there was a great deal of care taken of me.
<p/>After a while, I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had gone away, and left me at this house to be sold; and that's why they took such pains with me.
<p/>I didn't mean to get well, and hoped I shouldn't; but, in spite of me the fever went off and I grew healthy, and finally got up.
<p/>Then, they made me dress up, every day; and gentlemen used to come in and stand and smoke their cigars, and look at me, and ask questions, and debate my price.
<p/>When I came to myself, I was in a nice room,--but not mine. '' I was so gloomy and silent, that none of them wanted me.
<p/>They threatened to whip me, if I wasn't gayer, and didn't take some pains to make myself agreeable. At length, one day, came a gentleman named Stuart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) seemed to have some feeling for me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) saw that something dreadful was on my heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) came to see me alone, a great many times, and finally persuaded me to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) went to the hotel where my Henry was; they told him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been sold to a planter up on Pearl River; that was the last that I ever heard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>) bought me, at last, and promised to do all he (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>) could to find and buy back my children. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Pearl</b></font>) found where my daughter was; an old woman was keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Butler found out that it was for me he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) sent me word that I should never have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) offered an immense sum for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but they would not sell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Captain Stuart was very kind to me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stuart</b></font>) had a splendid plantation, and took me to it.
<p/>In the course of a year, I had a son born. O, that child!--how I loved it! How just like my poor Henry the little thing looked!
<p/>But I had made up my mind,--yes , I had. I would never again let a child live to grow up!
<p/>I took the little fellow in my arms, when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was two weeks old, and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and cried over him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); and then I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) laudanum, and held him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) close to my bosom, while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) slept to death.
<p/>How I mourned and cried over it! and who ever dreamed that it was anything but a mistake , that had made me give it the laudanum?
<p/>but it's one of the few things that I'm glad of, now. I am not sorry, to this day; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), at least, is out of pain.
<p/>After a while, the cholera came, and Captain Stuart died; everybody died that wanted to live,--and I,--I, though I went down to death's door,--
<p/>Then I was sold, and passed from hand to hand, till I grew faded and wrinkled, and I had a fever; and then this wretch bought me, and brought me here,--and here I am!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had hurried on through her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) story, with a wild, passionate utterance; sometimes seeming to address it to Tom, and sometimes speaking as in a soliloquy.
<p/>So vehement and overpowering was the force with which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke, that, for a season, Tom was beguiled even from the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wounds, and, raising himself on one elbow, watched her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) paced restlessly up and down, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) long black hair swaying heavily about her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) moved.
<p/>You tell me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, after a pause, <div class="bookquote">``that there is a God,--a God that looks down and sees all these things.
<p/>What better than death could I give him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), poor child! I lived! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The woman stopped. '' May be it's so.
<p/>The sisters in the convent used to tell me of a day of judgment, when everything is coming to light;--won't there be vengeance, then! ''
<p/>It's all a small matter; yet I've walked the streets when it seemed as if I had misery enough in my one heart to sink the city.
<p/>They think it's nothing, what we suffer,--nothing, what our children suffer! I've wished the houses would fall on me, or the stones sink under me.
<p/>and, in the judgment day, I will stand up before God, a witness against those that have ruined me and my children, body and soul!
<p/>Now, I'm a lost soul, pursued by devils that torment me day and night; they keep pushing me on and on--and I'll do it, too, some of these days!''
<p/>Yes! '' When I was a girl, I thought I was religious; I used to love God and prayer. she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, clenching her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand, while an insane light glanced in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heavy black eyes.
<p/>A wild, long laugh rang through the deserted room, and ended in a hysteric sob; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) threw herself on the floor, in convulsive sobbing and struggles.
<p/>'' I'll send him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) belongs,--a short way, too,--one of these nights, if they burn me alive for it!'' In a few moments, the frenzy fit seemed to pass off; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose slowly, and seemed to collect herself.
<p/>'' Can I do anything more for you, my poor fellow? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, approaching where Tom lay; <div class="bookquote">``shall I give you some more water?
<p/>There was a graceful and compassionate sweetness in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice and manner, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said this, that formed a strange contrast with the former wildness.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Tom drank the water, and looked earnestly and pitifully into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. '' O, Missis, I wish you'd go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that can give you living waters!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I used to see the picture of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), over the altar, when I was a girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dark eyes fixing themselves in an expression of mournful reverie;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)! Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)? Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)?''

<p/>Tom looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would speak again; but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) short, with a decided gesture. '' Don't talk, my poor fellow.
<p/>Try to sleep, if you can. '' And, placing water in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) reach, and making whatever little arrangements for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) comforts she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could, Cassy left the shed.

<p/>CHAPTER XXXV The Tokens Striking the electric chain wherewith we're darkly bound. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHILDE HAROLD'S PILGRIMAGE, CAN. 4. The sitting-room of Legree's establishment was a large, long room, with a wide, ample fireplace.
<p/>It had once been hung with a showy and expensive paper, which now hung mouldering, torn and discolored, from the damp walls.
<p/>The place had that peculiar sickening, unwholesome smell, compounded of mingled damp, dirt and decay, which one often notices in close old houses.
<p/>The wall-paper was defaced, in spots, by slops of beer and wine; or garnished with chalk memorandums, and long sums footed up, as if somebody had been practising arithmetic there.
<p/>In the fireplace stood a brazier full of burning charcoal; for, though the weather was not cold, the evenings always seemed damp and chilly in that great room; and Legree, moreover, wanted a place to light his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) cigars, and heat his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) water for punch.
<p/>The ruddy glare of the charcoal displayed the confused and unpromising aspect of the room,--saddles, bridles, several sorts of harness, riding-whips, overcoats, and various articles of clothing, scattered up and down the room in confused variety; and the dogs, of whom we have before spoken, had encamped themselves among them, to suit their own taste and convenience.
<p/>Legree was just mixing himself a tumbler of punch, pouring his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hot water from a cracked and broken-nosed pitcher, grumbling, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) did so, <div class="bookquote">``Plague on that Sambo, to kick up this yer row between me and the new hands!
<p/>The fellow won't be fit to work for a week, now,--right in the press of the season!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, just like you,'' said a voice, behind his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) chair.
<p/>It was the woman Cassy, who had stolen upon his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) soliloquy. '' Hah! you she-devil! you've come back, have you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I have,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, coolly; <div class="bookquote">``come to have my own way, too!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You lie, you jade! I'll be up to my word. Either behave yourself, or stay down to the quarters, and fare and work with the rest.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I'd rather, ten thousand times,''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the woman, <div class="bookquote">``live in the dirtiest hole at the quarters, than be under your hoof!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>But you are under my hoof, for all that,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), turning upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), with a savage grin; <div class="bookquote">``that's one comfort.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>So, sit down here on my knee, my dear, and hear to reason,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), laying hold on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrist.
<p/>Simon Legree, take care!'' said the woman, with a sharp flash of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye, a glance so wild and insane in its light as to be almost appalling.
<p/>'' '' You're afraid of me, Simon,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, deliberately; <div class="bookquote">``and you've reason to be! But be careful, for I've got the devil in me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The last words she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whispered in a hissing tone, close to his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">``Get out! I believe, to my soul, you have!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), and looking uncomfortably at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>'' After all, Cassy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``why can't you be friends with me, as you used to?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Used to!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), bitterly.
<p/>Cassy had always kept over Legree the kind of influence that a strong, impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man; but, of late, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had grown more and more irritable and restless, under the hideous yoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) servitude, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) irritability, at times, broke out into raving insanity; and this liability made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a sort of object of dread to Legree, who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is common to coarse and uninstructed minds.
<p/>When Legree brought Emmeline to the house, all the smouldering embers of womanly feeling flashed up in the worn heart of Cassy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took part with the girl; and a fierce quarrel ensued between her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Legree.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped short,--a word of choking feelings, rising in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart, kept her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) silent. Legree, in a fury, swore she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should be put to field service, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would not be peaceable.
<p/>Cassy, with proud scorn, declared she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would go to the field. And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) worked there one day, as we have described, to show how perfectly she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scorned the threat.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presented her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) basket at the scales, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had hoped for some concession, and addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in a sort of half conciliatory, half scornful tone; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had answered with the bitterest contempt.
<p/>The outrageous treatment of poor Tom had roused her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still more; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had followed Legree to the house, with no particular intention, but to upbraid him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) brutality.
<p/>Legree was secretly uneasy, all day; for Cassy had an influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) could not free himself. ''
<p/>And what have you been doing?--you, who haven't even sense enough to keep from spoiling one of your best hands, right in the most pressing season, just for your devilish temper!''
<p/>I wish, Cassy,'' said Legree, <div class="bookquote">``you'd behave yourself decently. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>'' You talk about behaving decently! <div class="bookquote">``I was a fool, it's a fact, to let any such brangle come up,''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but, when the boy set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) will, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had to be broke in.''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I reckon you won't break him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't I?''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, rising, passionately. '' I'd like to know if I won't? He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)'ll be the first nigger that ever came it round me!
<p/>I'll break every bone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) body, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) shall give up! '' Just then the door opened, and Sambo entered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) came forward, bowing, and holding out something in a paper. '' What's that, you dog?'' said Legree. '' It's a witch thing, Mas`r!''
<p/>'' A what?'' '' Something that niggers gets from witches. Keeps 'em from feelin' when they 's flogged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had it tied round his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) neck, with a black string.
<p/>There dropped out of it a silver dollar, and a long, shining curl of fair hair,--hair which, like a living thing, twined itself round Legree's fingers.
<p/>'' Legree, like most godless and cruel men, was superstitious. He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) took the paper, and opened it uneasily. <div class="bookquote">``Damnation!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) screamed, in sudden passion, stamping on the floor, and pulling furiously at the hair, as if it burned him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>'' Where did this come from? Take it off!--burn it up!--burn it up! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) screamed, tearing it off, and throwing it into the charcoal.
<p/>Sambo stood, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) heavy mouth wide open, and aghast with wonder; and Cassy, who was preparing to leave the apartment, stopped, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) in perfect amazement.
<p/>'' What did you bring it to me for? '' '' Don't you bring me any more of your devilish things!
<p/>'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>), shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) fist at Sambo, who retreated hastily towards the door; and, picking up the silver dollar, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) sent it smashing through the window-pane, out into the darkness.
<p/>Sambo was glad to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) escape. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) was gone, Legree seemed a little ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fit of alarm.
<p/>Cassy prepared herself for going out, unobserved by him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>); and slipped away to minister to poor Tom, as we have already related.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat doggedly down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chair, and began sullenly sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tumbler of punch. And what was the matter with Legree?
<p/>and what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form of cruelty?
<p/>Hard and reprobate as the godless man seemed now, there had been a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been rocked on the bosom of a mother,--cradled with prayers and pious hymns,--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now seared brow bedewed with the waters of holy baptism.
<p/>To answer this, we must carry the reader backward in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) history. In early childhood, a fair-haired woman had led him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), at the sound of Sabbath bell, to worship and to pray.
<p/>Born of a hard-tempered sire, on whom that gentle woman had wasted a world of unvalued love, Legree had followed in the steps of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) father.
<p/>Boisterous, unruly, and tyrannical, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) despised all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) counsel, and would none of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reproof; and, at an early age, broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), to seek his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fortunes at sea.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) never came home but once, after; and then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mother, with the yearning of a heart that must love something, and has nothing else to love, clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), and sought, with passionate prayers and entreaties, to win him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) from a life of sin, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) soul's eternal good.
<p/>That was Legree's day of grace; then good angels called him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>); then he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was almost persuaded, and mercy held him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) by the hand.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) heart inly relented,--there was a conflict,--but sin got the victory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) set all the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) rough nature against the conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) conscience.
<p/>Far in New England that mother had trained her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) only son, with long, unwearied love, and patient prayers. He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) drank and swore,--was wilder and more brutal than ever.
<p/>And, one night, when his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) mother, in the last agony of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) despair, knelt at his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) spurned her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) from him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>),--threw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) senseless on the floor, and, with brutal curses, fled to his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) ship.
<p/>The next Legree heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mother was, when, one night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was carousing among drunken companions, a letter was put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) opened it, and a lock of long, curling hair fell from it, and twined about his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fingers. The letter told him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mother was dead, and that, dying, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) blest and forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>There is a dread, unhallowed necromancy of evil, that turns things sweetest and holiest to phantoms of horror and affright. That pale, loving mother,--her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dying prayers, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) forgiving
<p/>love,--wrought in that demoniac heart of sin only as a damning sentence, bringing with it a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation.
<p/>Legree burned the hair, and burned the letter; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) saw them hissing and crackling in the flame, inly shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) thought of everlasting fires.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) tried to drink, and revel, and swear away the memory; but often, in the deep night, whose solemn stillness arraigns the bad soul in forced communion with herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had seen that pale mother rising by his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) bedside, and felt the soft twining of that hair around his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fingers, till the cold sweat would roll down his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) would spring from his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) bed in horror.
<p/>Ye who have wondered to hear, in the same evangel, that God is love, and that God is a consuming fire, see ye not how, to the soul resolved in evil, perfect love is the most fearful torture, the seal and sentence of the direst despair?
<p/>'' Blast it! '' said Legree to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) liquor; <div class="bookquote">``where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) get that? If it didn't look just like--whoo!
<p/>I thought I'd forgot that. Curse me, if I think there's any such thing as forgetting anything, any how,--hang it! I'm lonesome!
<p/>Legree stepped out into a large entry, which went up stairs, by what had formerly been a superb winding staircase; but the passage-way was dirty and dreary, encumbered with boxes and unsightly litter.
<p/>I mean to call Em. She (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hates me--the monkey! I don't care,--I'll make her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The stairs, uncarpeted, seemed winding up, in the gloom, to nobody knew where!
<p/>The pale moonlight streamed through a shattered fanlight over the door; the air was unwholesome and chilly, like that of a vault.
<p/>Legree stopped at the foot of the stairs, and heard a voice singing. It seemed strange and ghostlike in that dreary old house, perhaps because of the already tremulous state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) nerves.
<p/>A wild, pathetic voice, chants a hymn common among the slaves: <div class="bookquote">``O there'll be mourning, mourning, mourning, O there'll be mourning, at the judgment-seat of Christ!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the slaves</b></font>)</div><p/>Hark! what is it? <div class="bookquote">``Blast the girl!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree. '' I'll choke her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).--Em! Em! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) called, harshly; but only a mocking echo from the walls answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>The sweet voice still sung on: <div class="bookquote">``Parents and children there shall part! Parents and children there shall part! Shall part to meet no more!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And clear and loud swelled through the empty halls the refrain, <div class="bookquote">``O there'll be mourning, mourning, mourning, O there'll be mourning, at the judgment-seat of Christ!''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would have been ashamed to tell of it, but large drops of sweat stood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) forehead, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) heart beat heavy and thick with fear; he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) even thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) saw something white rising and glimmering in the gloom before him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), and shuddered to think what if the form of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) dead mother should suddenly appear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>).
<p/>I know one thing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said to himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) stumbled back in the sitting-room, and sat down; <div class="bookquote">``I'll let that fellow alone, after this!
<p/>Legree stopped. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>What did I want of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) cussed paper? I b`lieve I am bewitched, sure enough! I've been shivering and sweating, ever since!
<p/>Where did he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) get that hair? It couldn't have been that! I burnt that up , I know I did! It would be a joke, if hair could rise from the dead!
<p/>Ah, Legree! that golden tress was charmed; each hair had in it a spell of terror and remorse for thee, and was used by a mightier power to bind thy cruel hands from inflicting uttermost evil on the helpless!
<p/>I say,'' said Legree, stamping and whistling to the dogs, <div class="bookquote">``wake up, some of you, and keep me company!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>but the dogs only opened one eye at him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), sleepily, and closed it again.
<p/>I'll have Sambo and Quimbo up here, to sing and dance one of their hell dances, and keep off these horrid notions,'' said Legree; and, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) went on to the verandah, and blew a horn, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) commonly summoned his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) two sable drivers.
<p/>Legree was often wont, when in a gracious humor, to get these two worthies into his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) sitting-room, and, after warming them up with whiskey, amuse himself by setting them to singing, dancing or fighting, as the humor took him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>It was between one and two o'clock at night, as Cassy was returning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) ministrations to poor Tom, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) heard the sound of wild shrieking, whooping, halloing, and singing, from the sitting-room, mingled with the barking of dogs, and other symptoms of general uproar.
<p/>Legree and both the drivers, in a state of furious intoxication, were singing, whooping, upsetting chairs, and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid grimaces at each other.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) small, slender hand on the window-blind, and looked fixedly at them;--there was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce bitterness, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) black eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) did so.
<p/>'' '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) came up on the verandah steps, and looked in. '' Would it be a sin to rid the world of such a wretch?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) said to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) turned hurriedly away, and, passing round to a back door, glided up stairs, and tapped at Emmeline's door.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXVI Emmeline and Cassy Cassy entered the room, and found Emmeline sitting, pale with fear, in the furthest corner of it.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) came in, the girl started up nervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) arm, said, <div class="bookquote">``O Cassy, is it you?
<p/>I'm so glad you've come! I was afraid it was--. O, you don't know what a horrid noise there has been, down stairs, all this evening!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I ought to know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy, dryly. '' I've heard it often enough.'' <div class="bookquote">``O Cassy! do tell me,--couldn't we get away from this place?
<p/>I don't care where,--into the swamp among the snakes,--anywhere! Couldn't we get somewhere away from here?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>'' Nowhere, but into our graves,'' said Cassy.
<p/>'' Did you ever try?'' <div class="bookquote">``I've seen enough of trying and what comes of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy. '' I'd be willing to live in the swamps, and gnaw the bark from trees.
<p/>There have been a good many here of your opinion,'' said Cassy; <div class="bookquote">``but you couldn't stay in the swamps,--you'd be tracked by the dogs, and brought back, and then--then--
<p/>I an't afraid of snakes! I'd rather have one near me than him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline, eagerly. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``What would he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) do?''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the girl, looking, with breathless interest, into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face.
<p/>'' What wouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) do, you'd better ask,'' said Cassy. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s learned his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) trade well, among the pirates in the West Indies.
<p/>You wouldn't sleep much, if I should tell you things I've seen,--things that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tells of, sometimes, for good jokes. I've heard screams here that I haven't been able to get out of my head for weeks and weeks.
<p/>There's a place way out down by the quarters, where you can see a black, blasted tree, and the ground all covered with black ashes.
<p/>Ask anyone what was done there, and see if they will dare to tell you.'' <div class="bookquote">``O! what do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I won't tell you.
<p/>And I tell you, the Lord only knows what we may see tomorrow, if that poor fellow holds out as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'s begun.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I hate to think of it. <div class="bookquote">``Horrid! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline, every drop of blood receding from her (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) cheeks. '' O, Cassy, do tell me what I shall do!''
<p/>'' What I've done. Do the best you can,--do what you must,--and make it up in hating and cursing. '' ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wanted to make me drink some of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hateful brandy,'' said Emmeline; <div class="bookquote">``and I hate it so-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>'' You'd better drink,'' said Cassy.
<p/>'' I hated it, too; and now I can't live without it. One must have something;--things don't look so dreadful, when you take that.''
<p/>'' Mother used to tell me never to touch any such thing,'' said Emmeline. '' Mother told you!'' said Cassy, with a thrilling and bitter emphasis on the word mother.
<p/>'' What use is it for mothers to say anything? You are all to be bought and paid for, and your souls belong to whoever gets you.
<p/>That's the way it goes. I say, drink brandy; drink all you can, and it'll make things come easier.'' <div class="bookquote">``O, Cassy! do pity me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Pity you!--don't I? Haven't I a daughter,--Lord knows where she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is, and whose she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is, now,--going the way her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother went, before her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), I suppose, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) children must go, after her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)!
<p/>There's no end to the curse--forever!'' <div class="bookquote">``I wish I'd never been born!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hands. '' That's an old wish with me,'' said Cassy.
<p/>I'd die, if I dared to,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said, looking out into the darkness, with that still, fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) face when at rest.
<p/>'' I've got used to wishing that. '' It would be wicked to kill one's self,'' said Emmeline. '' I don't know why,--no wickeder than things we live and do, day after day.
<p/>If it would only be the end of us, why, then--'' Emmeline turned away, and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hands.
<p/>While this conversation was passing in the chamber, Legree, overcome with his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) carouse, had sunk to sleep in the room below.
<p/>But the sisters told me things, when I was in the convent, that make me afraid to die. Legree was not an habitual drunkard.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) coarse, strong nature craved, and could endure, a continual stimulation, that would have utterly wrecked and crazed a finer one.
<p/>But a deep, underlying spirit of cautiousness prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) often yielding to appetite in such measure as to lose control of himself.
<p/>This night, however, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) feverish efforts to banish from his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mind those fearful elements of woe and remorse which woke within him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had indulged more than common; so that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had discharged his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) sable attendants, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fell heavily on a settle in the room, and was sound asleep.
<p/>O! how dares the bad soul to enter the shadowy world of sleep?--that land whose dim outlines lie so fearfully near to the mystic scene of retribution!
<p/>Legree dreamed. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) heavy and feverish sleep, a veiled form stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), and laid a cold, soft hand upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) knew who it was; and shuddered, with creeping horror, though the face was veiled. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) felt
<p/>that hair twining round his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fingers; and then, that it slid smoothly round his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) neck, and tightened and tightened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) could not draw his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) breath; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) thought voices whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>),--whispers that chilled him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) with horror.
<p/>Then it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was on the edge of a frightful abyss, holding on and struggling in mortal fear, while dark hands stretched up, and were pulling him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) over; and Cassy came behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) laughing, and pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mother; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) turned away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fell down, down, down, amid a confused noise of shrieks, and groans, and shouts of demon laughter,--and
<p/>And then rose up that solemn veiled figure, and drew aside the veil. Legree awoke. Calmly the rosy hue of dawn was stealing into the room.
<p/>The morning star stood, with its solemn, holy eye of light, looking down on the man of sin, from out the brightening sky.
<p/>O, with what freshness, what solemnity and beauty, is each new day born; as if to say to insensate man, <div class="bookquote">``Behold!
<p/>thou hast one more chance! Strive for immortal glory! ''  (<font color='red'><b>man Behold</b></font>)</div>There is no speech nor language where this voice is not heard; but the bold, bad man heard it not.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) woke with an oath and a curse. What to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the gold and purple, the daily miracle of morning!
<p/>What to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the sanctity of the star which the Son of God has hallowed as his (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) own emblem? Brute-like, he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) saw without perceiving; and, stumbling forward, poured out a tumbler of brandy, and drank half of it.
<p/>'' I've had a h--l of a night! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Son</b></font>) said to Cassy, who just then entered from an opposite door.
<p/>'' You'll get plenty of the same sort, by and by,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), dryly. '' What do you mean, you minx?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You'll find out, one of these days,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>returned Cassy, in the same tone. '' Now Simon, I've one piece of advice to give you.''
<p/>'' The devil, you have!'' '' My advice is,'' said Cassy, steadily, as she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) began adjusting some things about the room, <div class="bookquote">``that you let Tom alone.
<p/>If you want to pay twelve hundred for a fellow, and use him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) right up in the press of the season, just to serve your own spite, it's no business of mine, I've done what I could for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' What business is 't of yours?'' ``What? To be sure, I don't know what it should be. <div class="bookquote">``You have?
<p/>What business have you meddling in my matters?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' None, to be sure. I've saved you some thousands of dollars, at different times, by taking care of your hands,--that
<p/>'s all the thanks I get. If your crop comes shorter into market than any of theirs, you won't lose your bet, I suppose?
<p/>Tompkins won't lord it over you, I suppose,--and you'll pay down your money like a lady, won't you? I think I see you doing it!
<p/>'' Legree, like many other planters, had but one form of ambition,--to have in the heaviest crop of the season,--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had several bets on this very present season pending in the next town.
<p/>Well, I'll let him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) off at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)'s got,'' said Legree; <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) shall beg my pardon, and promise better fashions.
<p/>Cassy, therefore, with woman's tact, touched the only string that could be made to vibrate. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``That he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) won't do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Won't,--eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) won't,'' said Cassy. '' I'd like to know why , Mistress,'' said Legree, in the extreme of scorn.
<p/>'' Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)'s done right, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) knows it, and won't say he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)'s done wrong. '' <div class="bookquote">``Who a cuss cares what he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) knows?
<p/>The nigger shall say what I please, or--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Or, you'll lose your bet on the cotton crop, by keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) out of the field, just at this very press.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) will give up,--course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) will; don't I know what niggers is? He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)'ll beg like a dog, this morning.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) won't, Simon; you don't know this kind. You may kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) by inches,--you won't get the first word of confession out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>).
<p/>Legree, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) talked so stoutly to Cassy, still sallied forth from the house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>'' '' We'll see,--where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)? '' said Legree, going out. '' In the waste-room of the gin-house,'' said Cassy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) dreams of the past night, mingled with Cassy's prudential suggestions, considerably affected his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) resolved that nobody should be witness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) encounter with Tom; and determined, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) could not subdue him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) by bullying, to defer his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) vengeance, to be wreaked in a more convenient season.
<p/>The solemn light of dawn--the angelic glory of the morning-star--had looked in through the rude window of the shed where Tom was lying; and, as if descending on that star-beam, came the solemn words,
<p/>The mysterious warnings and intimations of Cassy, so far from discouraging his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) soul, in the end had roused it as with a heavenly call.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) did not know but that the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) death was dawning in the sky; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart throbbed with solemn throes of joy and desire, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought that the wondrous all , of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had often pondered,--the great white throne, with its ever radiant rainbow; the white-robed multitude, with voices as many waters; the crowns, the palms, the harps,--might all break upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) vision before that sun should set again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am the root and offspring of David, and the bright and morning star. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, therefore, without shuddering or trembling, he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) heard the voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) persecutor, as he (<font color='blue'><b>David</b></font>) drew near.
<p/>'' Well, my boy,'' said Legree, with a contemptuous kick, <div class="bookquote">``how do you find yourself? Didn't I tell yer I could larn yer a thing or two?
<p/>How do yer like it--eh? How did yer whaling agree with yer, Tom? An't quite so crank as ye was last night.
<p/>Ye couldn't treat a poor sinner, now, to a bit of sermon, could ye,--eh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>Tom answered nothing. '' Get up, you beast!
<p/>This was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint; and, as Tom made efforts to do so, Legree laughed brutally.
<p/>'' said Legree, kicking him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) again. '' What makes ye so spry, this morning, Tom? Cotched cold, may be, last night.
<p/>'' Tom by this time had gained his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feet, and was confronting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master with a steady, unmoved front. '' The devil, you can!
<p/>'' said Legree, looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) over. '' I believe you haven't got enough yet. Now, Tom, get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon, for yer shines last night.
<p/>'' Tom did not move. '' Down, you dog! '' said Legree, striking him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) riding-whip. '' Mas'r Legree,'' said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``I can't do it.
<p/>I did only what I thought was right. I shall do just so again, if ever the time comes. I never will do a cruel thing, come what may.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, but ye don't know what may come, Master Tom. Ye think what you've got is something. I tell you `tan't anything,--nothing 't all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mas`r,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``I know ye can do dreadful things; but,'' (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stretched himself upward and clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands,--<div class="bookquote">``but, after ye've killed the body, there an't no more ye can do.
<p/>ETERNITY,--the word thrilled through the black man's soul with light and power, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke; it thrilled through the sinner's soul, too, like the bite of a scorpion.
<p/>Legree gnashed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) teeth, but rage kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) silent; and Tom, like a man disenthralled, spoke, in a clear and cheerful voice,

<p/>Mas'r Legree, I ain't a grain afeard to die. I'd as soon die as not. Ye may whip me, starve me,

<p/>'' The Lord Almighty,'' said Tom. '' D--n you! '' said Legree, as with one blow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fist he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) felled Tom to the earth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) turned,--it was Cassy's; but the cold soft touch recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dream of the night before, and, flashing through the chambers of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brain, came all the fearful images of the night-watches, with a portion of the horror that accompanied them.
<p/>A cold soft hand fell on Legree's at this moment. '' Will you be a fool?'' said Cassy, in French. <div class="bookquote">``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) go!
<p/>They say the alligator, the rhinoceros, though enclosed in bullet-proof mail, have each a spot where they are vulnerable; and fierce, reckless, unbelieving reprobates, have commonly this point in superstitious dread.

<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) said to Tom; <div class="bookquote">``I won't deal with ye now, because the business is pressing, and I want all my hands; but I never forget.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Well, have it your own way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, doggedly, to Cassy. '' Hark, ye! '' I'll score it against ye, and sometime I'll have my pay out o' yer old black hide,--mind ye!''
<p/>Legree turned, and went out. '' There you go,'' said Cassy, looking darkly after him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``your reckoning's to come, yet!--My poor fellow, how are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The Lord God hath sent his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) angel, and shut the lion's mouth, for this time,'' said Tom. '' For this time, to be sure,'' said Cassy;

<p/>A while we must leave Tom in the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) persecutors, while we turn to pursue the fortunes of George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife, whom we left in friendly hands, in a farmhouse on the road-side.
<p/>Tom Loker we left groaning and touzling in a most immaculately clean Quaker bed, under the motherly supervision of Aunt Dorcas, who found him (<font color='blue'><b>Loker</b></font>) to the full as tractable a patient as a sick bison.
<p/>Imagine a tall, dignified, spiritual woman, whose clear muslin cap shades waves of silvery hair, parted on a broad, clear forehead, which overarches thoughtful gray eyes.
<p/>A snowy handkerchief of lisse crape is folded neatly across her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glossy brown silk dress rustles peacefully, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) glides up and down the chamber.
<p/>'' The devil!'' says Tom Loker, giving a great throw to the bedclothes. '' I must request thee, Thomas, not to use such language,'' says Aunt Dorcas, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) quietly rearranged the bed.
<p/>'' Well, I won't, granny, if I can help it,'' says Tom; ``but it is enough to make a fellow swear,--so cursedly hot!
<p/>Dorcas removed a comforter from the bed, straightened the clothes again, and tucked them in till Tom looked something like a chrysalis; remarking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorcas</b></font>) did so, <div class="bookquote">``I wish, friend, thee would leave off cursing and swearing, and think upon thy ways.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What the devil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">``should I think of them for? Last thing ever I want to think of--hang it all!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>And Tom flounced over, untucking and disarranging everything, in a manner frightful to behold. '' That fellow and gal are here
<p/>, I s`pose,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), sullenly, after a pause. '' They are so,'' said Dorcas. '' They'd better be off up to the lake,'' said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``the quicker the better.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Probably they will do so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Aunt Dorcas</b></font>)</div>said Aunt Dorcas, knitting peacefully. '' And hark ye,'' said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``we've got correspondents in Sandusky
<p/>, that watch the boats for us. I don't care if I tell, now. I hope they will get away, just to spite Marks,--the

<p/>'' But about the gal,--tell 'em to dress her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) up some way , so's to alter her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>gal</b></font>) description's out in Sandusky.''
<p/>As we at this place take leave of Tom Loker, we may as well say, that, having lain three weeks at the Quaker dwelling, sick with a rheumatic fever, which set in, in company with his (<font color='blue'><b>Loker</b></font>) other afflictions, Tom arose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man; and, in place of slave-catching, betook himself to life in one of the new settlements, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears, wolves, and other inhabitants of the forest, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made himself quite a name in the land.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will attend to that matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorcas/Aunt Dorcas</b></font>)</div>said Dorcas, with characteristic composure. Tom always spoke reverently of the Quakers. '' Nice people,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would say; <div class="bookquote">``wanted to convert me, but couldn't come it, exactly.
<p/>But, tell ye what, stranger, they do fix up a sick fellow first rate,--no mistake. Make jist the tallest kind o' broth and knicknacks.
<p/>As Tom had informed them that their party would be looked for in Sandusky, it was thought prudent to divide them.
<p/>Jim, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) old mother, was forwarded separately; and a night or two after, George and Eliza, with their child, were driven privately into Sandusky, and lodged beneath a hospital roof, preparatory to taking their last passage on the lake.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Their night was now far spent, and the morning star of liberty rose fair before them!--electric word! What is it?
<p/>Why, men and women of America, does your heart's blood thrill at that word, for which your fathers bled, and your braver mothers were willing that their noblest and best should die?
<p/>Is there anything in it glorious and dear for a nation, that is not also glorious and dear for a man?
<p/>Is there anything more in it than a name--a rhetorical flourish? What is freedom to a nation, but freedom to the individuals in it?
<p/>What is freedom to that young man, who sits there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms folded over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broad chest, the tint of African blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheek, its dark fires in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes,--what is freedom to George Harris?
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>), it is the right of a man to be a man, and not a brute; the right to call the wife of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, and to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) from lawless violence; the right to protect and educate his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) child; the right to have a home of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, a religion of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, a character of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, unsubject to the will of another.
<p/>All these thoughts were rolling and seething in George's breast, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was pensively leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand, watching his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was adapting to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slender and pretty form the articles of man's attire, in which it was deemed safest she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) should make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) escape.
<p/>Now for it,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stood before the glass, and shook down her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) silky abundance of black curly hair.
<p/>I say, George, it's almost a pity, isn't it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) held up some of it, playfully,--<div class="bookquote">``pity it's all got to come off?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>To your fathers, freedom was the right of a nation to be a nation. '' '' George smiled sadly, and made no answer.
<p/>Eliza turned to the glass, and the scissors glittered as one long lock after another was detached from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) head. ''
<p/>There, now, that'll do,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, taking up a hair-brush; <div class="bookquote">``now for a few fancy touches.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' There, an't I a pretty young fellow?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, turning around to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband, laughing and blushing at the same time. '' You always will be pretty, do what you will,'' said George.
<p/>'' What does make you so sober?'' said Eliza, kneeling on one knee, and laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). '' We are only within twenty-four hours of Canada, they say.
<p/>Only a day and a night on the lake, and then--oh, then!-- '' <div class="bookquote">``O, Eliza!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) towards him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``that is it!
<p/>Now my fate is all narrowing down to a point. To come so near, to be almost in sight, and then lose all.

(<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't fear,''  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife, hopefully. '' The good Lord would not have brought us so far, if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) didn't mean to carry us through.
<p/>I seem to feel him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with us, George.'' <div class="bookquote">``You are a blessed woman, Eliza!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) with a convulsive grasp.
<p/>'' But,--oh, tell me! can this great mercy be for us? Will these years and years of misery come to an end?--shall
<p/>I am sure of it, George,'' said Eliza, looking upward, while tears of hope and enthusiasm shone on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) long, dark lashes.
<p/>we be free? '' '' I feel it in me, that God is going to bring us out of bondage, this very day.
<p/>Well, indeed,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) off at arm's length, and looking admiringly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``you are a pretty little fellow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I will believe you, Eliza,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, rising suddenly up, <div class="bookquote">``I will believe,--come let's be off. That crop of little, short curls, is quite becoming.
<p/>Put on your cap. So--a little to one side. I never saw you look quite so pretty. But, it's almost time for the carriage;--I wonder if Mrs. Smyth has got Harry rigged?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>The door opened, and a respectable, middle-aged woman entered, leading little Harry, dressed in girl's clothes. '' What a pretty girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) makes,'' said Eliza, turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) round.
<p/>The child stood gravely regarding his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) mother in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) new and strange attire, observing a profound silence, and occasionally drawing deep sighs, and peeping at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) dark curls.
<p/>'' We call him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) Harriet, you see;--don't the name come nicely? '' '' Does Harry know mamma?'' said Eliza, stretching her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) hands toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<p/>Come Eliza, why do you try to coax him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), when you know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has got to be kept away from you?''
<p/>The child clung shyly to the woman. '' <div class="bookquote">``I know it's foolish,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>said Eliza; <div class="bookquote">``yet, I can't bear to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) turn away from me.
<p/>But come,--where's my cloak? Here,--how is it men put on cloaks, George?''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must wear it so,''  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband, throwing it over his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>'' So, then,'' said Eliza, imitating the motion,--<div class="bookquote">``and I must stamp, and take long steps, and try to look saucy. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>There is, now and then, a modest young man; and I think it would be easier for you to act that character.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't exert yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George. '' '' And these gloves! mercy upon us! '' said Eliza; <div class="bookquote">``why, my hands are lost in them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I advise you to keep them on pretty strictly,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George. '' Your slender paw might bring us all out.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've heard,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Smyth</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Smyth, <div class="bookquote">``that there have been men down, warning all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy.
<p/>Now, Mrs. Smyth, you are to go under our charge, and be our aunty,--you mind. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Smyth</b></font>)</div>'' '' They have!'' said George.
<p/>A hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings.
<p/>'' Well, if we see any such people, we can tell them. '' The disguises the party had assumed were in accordance with the hints of Tom Loker.
<p/>Mrs. Smyth, a respectable woman from the settlement in Canada, whither they were fleeing, being fortunately about crossing the lake to return thither, had consented to appear as the aunt of little Harry; and, in order to attach him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had been allowed to remain, the two last days, under her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) sole charge; and an extra amount of petting, jointed to an indefinite amount of seed-cakes and candy, had cemented a very close attachment on the part of the young gentleman.
<p/>The two young men, as they appeared, walked up the plank into the boat, Eliza gallantly giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) arm to Mrs. Smyth, and George attending to their baggage.
<p/>The hack drove to the wharf. George was standing at the captain's office, settling for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) party, when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) overheard two men talking by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) side.
<p/>'' I've watched every one that came on board,'' said one, <div class="bookquote">``and I know they're not on this boat. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The voice was that of the clerk of the boat.
<p/>The speaker whom he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) addressed was our sometime friend Marks, who, with that valuable perseverance which characterized him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), had come on to Sandusky, seeking whom he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) might devour.
<p/>'' You would scarcely know the woman from a white one,'' said Marks. '' The man is a very light mulatto; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a brand in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.
<p/>The hand with which George was taking the tickets and change trembled a little; but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned coolly around, fixed an unconcerned glance on the face of the speaker, and walked leisurely toward another part of the boat, where Eliza stood waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Smyth, with little Harry, sought the seclusion of the ladies' cabin, where the dark beauty of the supposed little girl drew many flattering comments from the passengers.
<p/>George had the satisfaction, as the bell rang out its farewell peal, to see Marks walk down the plank to the shore; and drew a long sigh of relief, when the boat had put a returnless distance between them.
<p/>'' It was a superb day. The blue waves of Lake Erie danced, rippling and sparkling, in the sun-light. A fresh breeze blew from the shore, and the lordly boat ploughed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way right gallantly onward.
<p/>Who thought, as George walked calmly up and down the deck of the steamer, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) shy companion at his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) side, of all that was burning in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bosom?
<p/>The mighty good that seemed approaching seemed too good, too fair, even to be a reality; and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt a jealous dread, every moment of the day, that something would rise to snatch it from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
<p/>O, what an untold world there is in one human heart! But the boat swept on. Hours fleeted, and, at last, clear and full rose the blessed English shores;
<p/>shores charmed by a mighty spell,--with one touch to dissolve every incantation of slavery, no matter in what language pronounced, or by what national power confirmed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) breath grew thick and short; a mist gathered before his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) silently pressed the little hand that lay trembling on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arm.
<p/>George and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife stood arm in arm, as the boat neared the small town of Amherstberg, in Canada. The bell rang; the boat stopped.
<p/>Scarcely seeing what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) did, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked out his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) baggage, and gathered his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) little party. The little company were landed on the shore.
<p/>They stood still till the boat had cleared; and then, with tears and embracings, the husband and wife, with their wondering child in their arms, knelt down and lifted up their hearts to God! ''
<p/>'T was something like the burst from death to life; From the grave's cerements to the robes of heaven; From sin's dominion, and from passion's strife, To the pure freedom of a soul forgiven; Where all the bonds of death and hell are riven, And mortal puts on immortality, When Mercy's hand hath turned the golden key, And Mercy's voice hath said, Rejoice, thy soul is free.
<p/>The little party were soon guided, by Mrs. Smyth, to the hospitable abode of a good missionary, whom Christian charity has placed here as a shepherd to the outcast and wandering, who are constantly finding an asylum on this shore.
<p/>'' Who can speak the blessedness of that first day of freedom? Is not the sense of liberty a higher and a finer one than any of the five?
<p/>Who can speak the blessings of that rest which comes down on the free man's pillow, under laws which insure to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the rights that God has given to man?
<p/>To move, speak and breathe,--go out and come in unwatched, and free from danger! How fair and precious to that mother was that sleeping child's face, endeared by the memory of a thousand dangers!
<p/>How impossible was it to sleep, in the exuberant possession of such blessedness! And yet, these two had not one acre of ground,--not
<p/>They had nothing more than the birds of the air, or the flowers of the field,--yet they could not sleep for joy.
<p/>a roof that they could call their own,--they had spent their all, to the last dollar. '' O, ye who take freedom from man, with what words shall ye answer it to God?''
<p/>Have not many of us, in the weary way of life, felt, in some hours, how far easier it were to die than to live?
<p/>The martyr, when faced even by a death of bodily anguish and horror, finds in the very terror of his (<font color='blue'><b>martyr</b></font>) doom a strong stimulant and tonic.
<p/>There is a vivid excitement, a thrill and fervor, which may carry through any crisis of suffering that is the birth-hour of eternal glory and rest.
<p/>But to live,--to wear on, day after day, of mean, bitter, low, harassing servitude, every nerve dampened and depressed, every power of feeling gradually smothered,--this long and wasting heart-martyrdom, this slow, daily bleeding away of the inward life, drop by drop, hour after hour,--this is the true searching test of what there may be in man or woman.
<p/>When Tom stood face to face with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) persecutor, and heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) threats, and thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) very soul that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hour was come, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heart swelled bravely in him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could bear torture and fire, bear anything, with the vision of Jesus and heaven but just a step beyond; but, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) was gone, and the present excitement passed off, came back the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) bruised and weary limbs,--came back the sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) utterly degraded, hopeless, forlorn estate; and the day passed wearily enough.
<p/>Long before his (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) wounds were healed, Legree insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) should be put to the regular field-work; and then came day after day of pain and weariness, aggravated by every kind of injustice and indignity that the ill-will of a mean and malicious mind could devise.
<p/>Whoever, in our circumstances, has made trial of pain, even with all the alleviations which, for us, usually attend it, must know the irritation that comes with it.
<p/>Tom no longer wondered at the habitual surliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) associates; nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found the placid, sunny temper, which had been the habitude of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) life, broken in on, and sorely strained, by the inroads of the same thing.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXVIII The Victory <div class="bookquote">``Thanks be unto God, who giveth us the victory. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>* * I Cor. 15:57. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had flattered himself on leisure to read his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Bible; but there was no such thing as leisure there.
<p/>Why shouldn't he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)?--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made more cotton by it, and gained his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wager; and if it wore out a few more hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could buy better ones.
<p/>At first, Tom used to read a verse or two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Bible, by the flicker of the fire, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had returned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) daily toil; but, after the cruel treatment he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) received, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) used to come home so exhausted, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head swam and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes failed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tried to read; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was fain to stretch himself down, with the others, in utter exhaustion.
<p/>Is it strange that the religious peace and trust, which had upborne him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hitherto, should give way to tossings of soul and despondent darkness?
<p/>In the height of the season, Legree did not hesitate to press all his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hands through, Sundays and week-days alike. The gloomiest problem of this mysterious life was constantly before his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) eyes,--souls crushed and ruined, evil triumphant, and God silent.
<p/>It was weeks and months that Tom wrestled, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own soul, in darkness and sorrow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought of Miss Ophelia's letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) Kentucky friends, and would pray earnestly that God would send him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) deliverance.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would watch, day after day, in the vague hope of seeing somebody sent to redeem him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and, when nobody came, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would crush back to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul bitter thoughts,--that it was vain to serve God, that God had forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sometimes saw Cassy; and sometimes, when summoned to the house, caught a glimpse of the dejected form of Emmeline, but held very little communion with either; in fact, there was no time for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to commune with anybody.
<p/>One evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was sitting, in utter dejection and prostration, by a few decaying brands, where his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) coarse supper was baking.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) put a few bits of brushwood on the fire, and strove to raise the light, and then drew his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) worn Bible from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>There were all the marked passages, which had thrilled his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul so often,--words of patriarchs and seers, poets and sages, who from early time had spoken courage to man,--voices from the great cloud of witnesses who ever surround us in the race of life.
<p/>Had the word lost its power, or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration?
<p/>Heavily sighing, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket. A coarse laugh roused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked up,--Legree was standing opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>'' Well, old boy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you find your religion don't work, it seems! I thought I should get that through your wool, at last!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The cruel taunt was more than hunger and cold and nakedness. Tom was silent. '' You were a fool,'' said Legree; <div class="bookquote">``for I meant to do well by you, when I bought you.
<p/>You might have been better off than Sambo, or Quimbo either, and had easy times; and, instead of getting cut up and thrashed, every day or two, ye might have had liberty to lord it round, and cut up the other niggers; and ye might have had, now and then, a good warming of whiskey punch.
<p/>Come, Tom, don't you think you'd better be reasonable?--heave that ar old pack of trash in the fire, and join my church!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The Lord forbid!'' said Tom, fervently. '' You see the Lord an't going to help you; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) had been, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wouldn't have let me get you!
<p/>This yer religion is all a mess of lying trumpery, Tom. I know all about it. Ye'd better hold to me; I'm somebody, and can do something!''
<p/>'' No, Mas'r ,'' said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``I'll hold on. The Lord may help me, or not help; but I'll hold to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to the last!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The more fool you!'' said Legree, spitting scornfully at him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), and spurning him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) foot. '' Never mind; I'll chase you down, yet, and bring you under,--you'll see!'' and Legree turned away.
<p/>When a heavy weight presses the soul to the lowest level at which endurance is possible, there is an instant and desperate effort of every physical and moral nerve to throw off the weight; and hence the heaviest anguish often precedes a return tide of joy and courage.
<p/>The atheistic taunts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) cruel master sunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) before dejected soul to the lowest ebb; and, though the hand of faith still held to the eternal rock, it was a numb, despairing grasp.
<p/>Suddenly everything around him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) seemed to fade, and a vision rose before him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) of one crowned with thorns, buffeted and bleeding.
<p/>Tom gazed, in awe and wonder, at the majestic patience of the face; the deep, pathetic eyes thrilled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) inmost heart; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) soul woke, as, with floods of emotion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands and fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knees,--when, gradually, the vision changed: the sharp thorns became rays of glory; and, in splendor inconceivable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) saw that same face bending compassionately towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and a voice said, <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that overcometh shall sit down with me on my throne, even as I also overcome, and am set down with my Father on his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) throne.
<p/>So was it now with Tom. Tom sat, like one stunned, at the fire. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>How long Tom lay there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew not.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came to himself, the fire was gone out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) clothes were wet with the chill and drenching dews; but the dread soul-crisis was past, and, in the joy that filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) no longer felt hunger, cold, degradation, disappointment, wretchedness.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) deepest soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that hour loosed and parted from every hope in life that now is, and offered his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own will an unquestioning sacrifice to the Infinite.
<p/>Tom looked up to the silent, ever-living stars,--types of the angelic hosts who ever look down on man; and the solitude of the night rung with the triumphant words of a hymn, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had sung often in happier days, but never with such feeling as now:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The earth shall be dissolved like snow, The sun shall cease to shine; But God, who called me here below, Shall be forever mine.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And when this mortal life shall fail, And flesh and sense shall cease, I shall possess within the veil A life of joy and peace.
<p/>'' When we've been there ten thousand years, Bright shining like the sun, We've no less days to sing God's praise
<p/>Those who have been familiar with the religious histories of the slave population know that relations like what we have narrated are very common among them.
<p/>Than when we first begun. '' We have heard some from their own lips, of a very touching and affecting character.
<p/>The psychologist tells us of a state, in which the affections and images of the mind become so dominant and overpowering, that they press into their service the outward imagining.
<p/>Who shall measure what an all-pervading Spirit may do with these capabilities of our mortality, or the ways in which He (<font color='blue'><b>psychologist</b></font>) may encourage the desponding souls of the desolate?
<p/>Did He (<font color='blue'><b>psychologist</b></font>) not say that his (<font color='blue'><b>psychologist</b></font>) mission, in all ages, was to bind up the broken-hearted, and set at liberty them that are bruised?
<p/>When the dim gray of dawn woke the slumberers to go forth to the field, there was among those tattered and shivering wretches one who walked with an exultant tread; for firmer than the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>psychologist</b></font>) trod on was his (<font color='blue'><b>psychologist</b></font>) strong faith in Almighty, eternal love.
<p/>If the poor forgotten slave believes that Jesus hath appeared and spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), who shall contradict him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)? Ah, Legree, try all your forces now!
<p/>Utmost agony, woe, degradation, want, and loss of all things, shall only hasten on the process by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) shall be made a king and a priest unto God!
<p/>From this time, an inviolable sphere of peace encompassed the lowly heart of the oppressed one,--an ever-present Saviour hallowed it as a temple.
<p/>Past now the bleeding of earthly regrets; past its fluctuations of hope, and fear, and desire; the human will, bent, and bleeding, and struggling long, was now entirely merged in the Divine.
<p/>So short now seemed the remaining voyage of life,--so near, so vivid, seemed eternal blessedness,--that life's uttermost woes fell from him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) unharming.
<p/>Cheerfulness and alertness seemed to return to him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>), and a quietness which no insult or injury could ruffle seemed to possess him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>).
<p/>All noticed the change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) appearance. '' What the devil's got into Tom? '' Legree said to Sambo. '' A while ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was all down in the mouth, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)'s peart as a cricket.
<p/>'' '' Dunno, Mas`r; gwine to run off, mebbe. '' <div class="bookquote">``Like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) try that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, with a savage grin, <div class="bookquote">``wouldn't we, Sambo?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess we would! Haw! haw! ho!

<p/>That night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) was returning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) would turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) horse and ride round the quarters, and see if all was safe.
<p/>It was a superb moonlight night, and the shadows of the graceful China trees lay minutely pencilled on the turf below, and there was that transparent stillness in the air which it seems almost unholy to disturb.
<p/>Ho, ho, ho! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sambo</b></font>)</div>This was spoken as Legree was getting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) horse, to go to the neighboring town. Legree was a little distance from the quarters, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) heard the voice of some one singing.
<p/>A musical tenor voice sang, ``When I can read my title clear To mansions in the skies, I'll bid farewell to every fear, And wipe my weeping eyes ``Should earth against my soul engage,
<p/>It was not a usual sound there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) paused to listen. And hellish darts be hurled, Then I can smile at Satan's rage, And face a frowning world.

<p/>'' * * '' '' So ho!'' said Legree to himself, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) thinks so, does he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)? How I hate these cursed Methodist hymns!
<p/>Here, you nigger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), coming suddenly out upon Tom, and raising his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) riding-whip, <div class="bookquote">``how dare you be gettin' up this yer row, when you ought to be in bed?
<p/>Shut yer old black gash, and get along in with you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, Mas`r,'' said Tom, with ready cheerfulness, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rose to go in.
<p/>Legree was provoked beyond measure by Tom's evident happiness; and riding up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), belabored him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) over his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) head and shoulders.
<p/>'' There, you dog,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``see if you'll feel so comfortable, after that!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But the blows fell now only on the outer man, and not, as before, on the heart.
<p/>Tom stood perfectly submissive; and yet Legree could not hide from himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) power over his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) bond thrall was somehow gone.
<p/>, there passed through his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mind one of those vivid flashes that often send the lightning of conscience across the dark and wicked soul.
<p/>And, as Tom disappeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cabin, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) horse suddenly round He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) understood full well that it was GOD who was standing between him (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>) victim, and he (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>) blasphemed him (<font color='blue'><b>GOD</b></font>).
<p/>That submissive and silent man, whom taunts, nor threats, nor stripes, nor cruelties, could disturb, roused a voice within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), such as of old his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Master roused in the demoniac soul, saying, <div class="bookquote">``What have we to do with thee, thou Jesus of Nazareth?--art thou come to torment us before the time?
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) it seemed as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) life-sorrows were now over, and as if, out of that strange treasury of peace and joy, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) had been endowed from above, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) longed to pour out something for the relief of their woes.
<p/>It is true, opportunities were scanty; but, on the way to the fields, and back again, and during the hours of labor, chances fell in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) way of extending a helping-hand to the weary, the disheartened and discouraged.
<p/>The poor, worn-down, brutalized creatures, at first, could scarce comprehend this; but, when it was continued week after week, and month after month, it began to awaken long-silent chords in their benumbed hearts.
<p/>Gradually and imperceptibly the strange, silent, patient man, who was ready to bear every one's burden, and sought help from none,--who stood aside for all, and came last, and took least, yet was foremost to share his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little all with any who needed,--the man who, in cold nights, would give up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tattered blanket to add to the comfort of some woman who shivered with sickness, and who filled the baskets of the weaker ones in the field, at the terrible risk of coming short in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own measure,--and who, though pursued with unrelenting cruelty by their common tyrant, never joined in uttering a word of reviling or cursing,--this man, at last, began to have a strange power over them; and, when the more pressing season was past, and they were allowed again their Sundays for their own use, many would gather together to hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of Jesus.
<p/>They would gladly have met to hear, and pray, and sing, in some place, together; but Legree would not permit it, and more than once broke up such attempts, with oaths and brutal execrations,--so that the blessed news had to circulate from individual to individual.
<p/>Yet who can speak the simple joy with which some of those poor outcasts, to whom life was a joyless journey to a dark unknown, heard of a compassionate Redeemer and a heavenly home?
<p/>It is the statement of missionaries, that, of all races of the earth, none have received the Gospel with such eager docility as the African.
<p/>The principle of reliance and unquestioning faith, which is its foundation, is more a native element in this race than any other; and it has often been found among them, that a stray seed of truth, borne on some breeze of accident into hearts the most ignorant, has sprung up into fruit, whose abundance has shamed that of higher and more skilful culture.
<p/>The poor mulatto woman, whose simple faith had been well-nigh crushed and overwhelmed, by the avalanche of cruelty and wrong which had fallen upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), felt her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul raised up by the hymns and passages of Holy Writ, which this lowly missionary breathed into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ear in intervals, as they were going to and returning from work; and even the half-crazed and wandering mind of Cassy was soothed and calmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) simple and unobtrusive influences.
<p/>Stung to madness and despair by the crushing agonies of a life, Cassy had often resolved in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul an hour of retribution, when her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand should avenge on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had been witness, or which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own person suffered.
<p/>One night, after all in Tom's cabin were sunk in sleep, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was suddenly aroused by seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face at the hole between the logs, that served for a window.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>Tom's whole soul overflowed with compassion and sympathy for the poor wretches by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was surrounded. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made a silent gesture for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to come out.
<p/>Tom remarked, as the light of the moon fell upon Cassy's large, black eyes, that there was a wild and peculiar glare in them, unlike their wonted fixed despair.
<p/>Come here, Father Tom,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) small hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wrist, and drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) forward with a force as if the hand were of steel; <div class="bookquote">``come here,--I've news for you.
<p/>Tom came out the door. It was between one and two o'clock at night,--broad, calm, still moonlight. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``What, Misse Cassy?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, anxiously. '' Tom, wouldn't you like your liberty?'' <div class="bookquote">``I shall have it, Misse, in God's time,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom.
<p/>'' Ay, but you may have it tonight,'' said Cassy, with a flash of sudden energy. <div class="bookquote">``Come on.''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>Tom hesitated. <div class="bookquote">``Come!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), in a whisper, fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) black eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come along! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s asleep--sound. I put enough into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) brandy to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) so.
<p/>I wish I'd had more,--I shouldn't have wanted you. But come, the back door is unlocked; there's an axe there , I put it there,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) room door is open; I'll show you the way.

(<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, firmly, stopping and holding her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) back, as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was pressing forward.
<p/>We might set them all free, and go somewhere in the swamps, and find an island, and live by ourselves; I've heard of its being done.
<p/>'' But think of all these poor creatures,'' said Cassy. '' Any life is better than this.'' <div class="bookquote">``No!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, firmly.
<p/>'' No! good never comes of wickedness. I'd sooner chop my right hand off!'' '' Then I shall do it,'' said Cassy, turning.
<p/>'' said Tom, throwing himself before her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``for the dear Lord's sake that died for ye, don't sell your precious soul to the devil, that way!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>O, Misse Cassy! Nothing but evil will come of it. The Lord hasn't called us to wrath. We must suffer, and wait his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) time.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Wait!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy. '' Haven't I waited?--waited till my head is dizzy and my heart sick? What has he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) made me suffer?
<p/>What has he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) made hundreds of poor creatures suffer? Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wringing the life-blood out of you? I'm called on; they call me!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) time's come, and I'll have his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heart's blood!'' <div class="bookquote">``No, no, no! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) small hands, which were clenched with spasmodic violence.
<p/>The dear, blessed Lord never shed no blood but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) poured out for us when we was enemies.
<p/>'' No, ye poor, lost soul, that ye mustn't do. Lord, help us to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) steps, and love our enemies.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Love!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy, with a fierce glare; <div class="bookquote">``love such enemies! It isn't in flesh and blood.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Misse, it isn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, looking up; ``but He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) gives it to us, and that's the victory.
<p/>When we can love and pray over all and through all, the battle's past, and the victory's come,--glory be to God!
<p/>latest called of nations,--called to the crown of thorns, the scourge, the bloody sweat, the cross of agony,--this is to be thy victory; by this shalt thou reign with Christ when his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) kingdom shall come on earth.
<p/>The deep fervor of Tom's feelings, the softness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) voice, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tears, fell like dew on the wild, unsettled spirit of the poor woman.
<p/>A softness gathered over the lurid fires of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked down, and Tom could feel the relaxing muscles of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Didn't I tell you that evil spirits followed me?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And, with streaming eyes and choking voice, the black man looked up to heaven. And this, oh Africa! O! Father Tom, I can't pray,--I wish I could.
<p/>I never have prayed since my children were sold! What you say must be right , I know it must; but when I try to pray, I can only hate and curse.
<p/>I can't pray!'' <div class="bookquote">``Poor soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, compassionately. '' Satan desires to have ye, and sift ye as wheat. I pray the Lord for ye.
<p/>O! Misse Cassy, turn to the dear Lord Jesus. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) came to bind up the broken-hearted, and comfort all that mourn.
<p/>Misse Cassy,'' said Tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in silence, <div class="bookquote">``if ye only could get away from here,--if
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) downcast eyes. '' the thing was possible,--I'd `vise ye and Emmeline to do it; that is, if ye could go without blood-guiltiness,--not otherwise.
<p/>No,'' said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``time was when I would; but the Lord's given me a work among these yer poor souls, and I'll stay with 'em and bear my cross with 'em till the end.

<p/>you'd better go, if you can. '' <div class="bookquote">``I know no way but through the grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy. '' Down in the darkest swamps, their dogs will hunt us out, and find us.
<p/>Tom stood silent; at length he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that saved Daniel in the den of lions,--that saved the children in the fiery furnace,--Him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) that walked on the sea, and bade the winds be still,--He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s alive yet; and I've faith to believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) can deliver you.
<p/>Everybody and everything is against us; even the very beasts side against us,--and where shall we go? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Try it, and I'll pray, with all my might, for you.
<p/>By what strange law of mind is it that an idea long overlooked, and trodden under foot as a useless stone, suddenly sparkles out in new light, as a discovered diamond?
<p/>Cassy had often revolved, for hours, all possible or probable schemes of escape, and dismissed them all, as hopeless and impracticable; but at this moment there flashed through her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mind a plan, so simple and feasible in all its details, as to awaken an instant hope.
<p/>'' '' Father Tom, I'll try it! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, suddenly. '' Amen! '' said Tom; <div class="bookquote">``the Lord help ye!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXXIX
<p/>The Stratagem '' The way of the wicked is as darkness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knoweth not at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stumbleth. '' * * Prov.
<p/>The garret of the house that Legree occupied, like most other garrets, was a great, desolate space, dusty, hung with cobwebs, and littered with cast-off lumber.
<p/>The opulent family that had inhabited the house in the days of its splendor had imported a great deal of splendid furniture, some of which they had taken away with them, while some remained standing desolate in mouldering, unoccupied rooms, or stored away in this place.
<p/>There was a small window there, which let in, through its dingy, dusty panes, a scanty, uncertain light on the tall, high-backed chairs and dusty tables, that had once seen better days.
<p/>Altogether, it was a weird and ghostly place; but, ghostly as it was, it wanted not in legends among the superstitious negroes, to increase its terrors.
<p/>4:19. One or two immense packing-boxes, in which this furniture was brought, stood against the sides of the garret. Some few years before, a negro woman, who had incurred Legree's displeasure, was confined there for several weeks.
<p/>What passed there, we do not say; the negroes used to whisper darkly to each other; but it was known that the body of the unfortunate creature was one day taken down from there, and buried; and, after that, it was said that oaths and cursings, and the sound of violent blows, used to ring through that old garret, and mingled with wailings and groans of despair.
<p/>Once, when Legree chanced to overhear something of this kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) flew into a violent passion, and swore that the next one that told stories about that garret should have an opportunity of knowing what was there, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) would chain them up there for a week.
<p/>This hint was enough to repress talking, though, of course, it did not disturb the credit of the story in the least.
<p/>Gradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the passage-way to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house, from every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually falling into desuetude.
<p/>It had suddenly occurred to Cassy to make use of the superstitious excitability, which was so great in Legree, for the purpose of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) liberation, and that of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) fellow-sufferer.
<p/>One day, without consulting Legree, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) suddenly took it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), with some considerable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances of the room to one at some considerable distance.
<p/>The under-servants, who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion, when Legree returned from a ride.
<p/>The sleeping-room of Cassy was directly under the garret. '' Hallo! you Cass!'' said Legree, <div class="bookquote">``what's in the wind now?''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Nothing; only I choose to have another room,'' said Cassy, doggedly. '' And what for, pray?'' said Legree. '' I choose to,'' said Cassy.
<p/>'' The devil you do! and what for?'' '' I'd like to get some sleep, now and then.'' <div class="bookquote">``Sleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could tell, I suppose, if you want to hear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy, dryly. '' Speak out, you minx!'' said Legree. ''
<p/>O! nothing. I suppose it wouldn't disturb you! Only groans, and people scuffing, and rolling round on the garret floor, half the night, from twelve to morning!''
<p/>Cassy raised her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sharp, black eyes, and looked in the face of Legree, with an expression that went through his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) bones, as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said, ``To be sure, Simon, who are they?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``People up garret!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, uneasily, but forcing a laugh; <div class="bookquote">``who are they, Cassy? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>I'd like to have you tell me.
<p/>With an oath, Legree struck at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) riding-whip; but she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) glided to one side, and passed through the door, and looking back, said, <div class="bookquote">``If you'll sleep in that room, you'll know all about it.
<p/>Legree blustered and swore, and threatened to break down the door; but apparently thought better of it, and walked uneasily into the sitting-room.
<p/>Cassy perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shaft had struck home; and, from that hour, with the most exquisite address, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) never ceased to continue the train of influences she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had begun.
<p/>In a knot-hole of the garret, that had opened, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had inserted the neck of an old bottle, in such a manner that when there was the least wind, most doleful and lugubrious wailing sounds proceeded from it, which, in a high wind, increased to a perfect shriek, such as to credulous and superstitious ears might easily seem to be that of horror and despair.
<p/>These sounds were, from time to time, heard by the servants, and revived in full force the memory of the old ghost legend.
<p/>A superstitious creeping horror seemed to fill the house; and though no one dared to breathe it to Legree, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) found himself encompassed by it, as by an atmosphere.
<p/>You don't know, I suppose! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Perhaps you'd better try it!'' and then immediately she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shut and locked the door. No one is so thoroughly superstitious as the godless man.
<p/>The Christian is composed by the belief of a wise, all-ruling Father, whose presence fills the void unknown with light and order; but to the man who has dethroned God, the spirit-land is, indeed, in the words of the Hebrew poet, <div class="bookquote">``a land of darkness and the shadow of death,''  (<font color='red'><b>the poet</b></font>)</div>without any order, where the light is as darkness.
<p/>Legree had had the slumbering moral elements in him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) roused by his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) encounters with Tom,--roused, only to be resisted by the determinate force of evil; but still there was a thrill and commotion of the dark, inner world, produced by every word, or prayer, or hymn, that reacted in superstitious dread.
<p/>Life and death to him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) are haunted grounds, filled with goblin forms of vague and shadowy dread. The influence of Cassy over him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was of a strange and singular kind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) knew, wholly, and without any possibility of help or redress, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hands; and yet so it is, that the most brutal man cannot live in constant association with a strong female influence, and not be greatly controlled by it.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first bought her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) said, a woman delicately bred; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), without scruple, beneath the foot of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brutality.
<p/>But, as time, and debasing influences, and despair, hardened womanhood within her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), and waked the fires of fiercer passions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had become in a measure his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) alternately tyrannized over and dreaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>This influence had become more harassing and decided, since partial insanity had given a strange, weird, unsettled cast to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) words and language.
<p/>A night or two after this, Legree was sitting in the old sitting-room, by the side of a flickering wood fire,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) owner, her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) tyrant and tormentor. that threw uncertain glances round the room. It was a stormy, windy night, such as raises whole squadrons of nondescript noises in rickety old houses.
<p/>Windows were rattling, shutters flapping, and wind carousing, rumbling, and tumbling down the chimney, and, every once in a while, puffing out smoke and ashes, as if a legion of spirits were coming after them.
<p/>Legree had been casting up accounts and reading newspapers for some hours, while Cassy sat in the corner; sullenly looking into the fire.
<p/>Legree laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) paper, and seeing an old book lying on the table, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had noticed Cassy reading, the first part of the evening, took it up, and began to turn it over.
<p/>It was one of those collections of stories of bloody murders, ghostly legends, and supernatural visitations, which, coarsely got up and illustrated, have a strange fascination for one who once begins to read them.
<p/>Legree poohed and pished, but read, turning page after page, till, finally, after reading some way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) threw down the book, with an oath.
<p/>'' You don't believe in ghosts, do you, Cass? '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Cass</b></font>), taking the tongs and settling the fire. '' I thought you'd more sense than to let noises scare you .''
<p/>'' No matter what I believe,'' said Cassy, sullenly. '' Fellows used to try to frighten me with their yarns at sea,'' said Legree.
<p/>'' Never come it round me that way. I'm too tough for any such trash, tell ye. '' Cassy sat looking intensely at him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) in the shadow of the corner.
<p/>There was that strange light in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fellows</b></font>) eyes that always impressed Legree with uneasiness. '' Them noises was nothing but rats and the wind,'' said Legree.
<p/>'' Rats will make a devil of a noise. I used to hear 'em sometimes down in the hold of the ship; and wind,--Lord's sake!
<p/>Cassy knew Legree was uneasy under her (<font color='blue'><b>Fellows</b></font>) eyes, and, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fellows</b></font>) made no answer, but sat fixing them on him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), with that strange, unearthly expression, as before.
<p/>Can rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and open a door when you've locked it and set a chair against it?'' said Cassy; <div class="bookquote">``and come walk, walk, walking right up to your bed, and put out their hand, so?
<p/>Cassy kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Fellows</b></font>) glittering eyes fixed on Legree, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fellows</b></font>) spoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fellows</b></font>) like a man in the nightmare, till, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fellows</b></font>) finished by laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Fellows</b></font>) hand, icy cold, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) sprung back, with an oath.
<p/>ye can make anything out o' wind. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come, speak out, woman,--don't you think so?''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree. '' '' '' Woman!
<p/>what do you mean? Nobody did?'' <div class="bookquote">``O, no,--of course not,--did I say they did?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy, with a smile of chilling derision.
<p/>'' But--did-- have you really seen?--Come, Cass, what is it, now,--speak out! '' <div class="bookquote">``You may sleep there, yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy, <div class="bookquote">``if you want to know.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did it come from the garret, Cassy?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It ,--what?'' said Cassy. '' Why, what you told of-- '' <div class="bookquote">``I didn't tell you anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy, with dogged sullenness.
<p/>Legree walked up and down the room, uneasily. '' I'll have this yer thing examined. I'll look into it, this very night.
<p/>I'll take my pistols-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Cassy; <div class="bookquote">``sleep in that room. I'd like to see you doing it. Fire your pistols,--do!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>Legree stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) foot, and swore violently. '' Don't swear,'' said Cassy; <div class="bookquote">``nobody knows who may be hearing you. Hark!
<p/>What was that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, starting. A heavy old Dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began, and slowly struck twelve.
<p/>For some reason or other, Legree neither spoke nor moved; a vague horror fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>); while Cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) eyes, stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), counting the strokes.
<p/>Twelve o'clock; well now we'll see,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), turning, and opening the door into the passage-way, and standing as if listening.
<p/>'' '' Hark! What's that?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) finger. '' It's only the wind,'' said Legree. '' Don't you hear how cursedly it blows?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Simon, come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy, in a whisper, laying her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>), and leading him (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) to the foot of the stairs: <div class="bookquote">``do you know what that is?
<p/>Hark! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>A wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. It came from the garret. Legree's knees knocked together; his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) face grew white with fear.
<p/>'' Hadn't you better get your pistols?'' said Cassy, with a sneer that froze Legree's blood. '' It's time this thing was looked into, you know.
<p/>I'd like to have you go up now; they're at it . '' <div class="bookquote">``I won't go!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, with an oath.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why not? There an't any such thing as ghosts, you know! Come!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>and Cassy flitted up the winding stairway, laughing, and looking back after him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I believe you are the devil!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree. <div class="bookquote">``Come back you hag,--come back, Cass! You shan't go! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>But Cassy laughed wildly, and fled on.
<p/>A wild gust of wind swept down, extinguishing the candle he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hand, and with it the fearful, unearthly screams; they seemed to be shrieked in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) very ear.
<p/>Legree fled frantically into the parlor, whither, in a few moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was followed by Cassy, pale, calm, cold as an avenging spirit, and with that same fearful light in her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) eye.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) open the entry doors that led to the garret. '' I hope you are satisfied,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>). ''
<p/>Blast you, Cass!'' said Legree. '' What for?'' said Cassy. '' I only went up and shut the doors. What's the matter with that garret , Simon, do you suppose?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>'' None of your business!'' said Legree. '' O, it an't? Well,'' said Cassy, <div class="bookquote">``at any rate, I'm glad I don't sleep under it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>Anticipating the rising of the wind, that very evening, Cassy had been up and opened the garret window. Of course, the moment the doors were opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light.
<p/>This may serve as a specimen of the game that Cassy played with Legree, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) would sooner have put his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) head into a lion's mouth than to have explored that garret.
<p/>Meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else was asleep, Cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) transferred, article by article, a greater part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) own and Emmeline's wardrobe.
<p/>By cajoling Legree, and taking advantage of a good-natured interval, Cassy had got him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) to the neighboring town, which was situated directly on the Red River.
<p/>With a memory sharpened to almost preternatural clearness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) remarked every turn in the road, and formed a mental estimate of the time to be occupied in traversing it.
<p/>At the time when all was matured for action, our readers may, perhaps, like to look behind the scenes, and see the final coup d'etat .
<p/>All things being arranged, they only waited a fitting opportunity to put their plan in execution. It was now near evening, Legree had been absent, on a ride to a neighboring farm.
<p/>For many days Cassy had been unusually gracious and accommodating in her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) humors; and Legree and she (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had been, apparently, on the best of terms.
<p/>At present, we may behold her (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) and Emmeline in the room of the latter, busy in sorting and arranging two small bundles.
<p/>'' There, these will be large enough,'' said Cassy. '' Now put on your bonnet, and let's start; it's just about the right time.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, they can see us yet,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline. '' I mean they shall,'' said Cassy, coolly. '' Don't you know that they must have their chase after us, at any rate?
<p/>The way of the thing is to be just this:--We will steal out of the back door, and run down by the quarters.
<p/>They will give chase, and we will get into the swamp; then, they can't follow us any further till they go up and give the alarm, and turn out the dogs, and so on; and, while they are blundering round, and tumbling over each other, as they always do, you and I will slip along to the creek, that runs back of the house, and wade along in it, till we get opposite the back door.
<p/>Sambo or Quimbo will be sure to see us. That will put the dogs all at fault; for scent won't lie in the water.
<p/>Every one will run out of the house to look after us, and then we'll whip in at the back door, and up into the garret, where I've got a nice bed made up in one of the great boxes.
<p/>We must stay in that garret a good while, for, I tell you, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) will raise heaven and earth after us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'ll muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations, and have a great hunt; and they'll go over every inch of ground in that swamp.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) makes it his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) boast that nobody ever got away from him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). So let him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hunt at his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) leisure.'' <div class="bookquote">``Cassy, how well you have planned it!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline.
<p/>'' Who ever would have thought of it, but you? '' There was neither pleasure nor exultation in Cassy's eyes,--only a despairing firmness.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said, reaching her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand to Emmeline. The two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house, and flitted, through the gathering shadows of evening, along by the quarters.
<p/>As Cassy expected, when quite near the verge of the swamps that encircled the plantation, they heard a voice calling to them to stop.
<p/>The crescent moon, set like a silver signet in the western sky, delayed a little the approach of night. It was not Sambo, however, but
<p/>At the sound, the feebler spirit of Emmeline gave way; and, laying hold of Cassy's arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emmeline</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``O, Cassy, I'm going to faint!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>If you do, I'll kill you!'' said Cassy, drawing a small, glittering stiletto, and flashing it before the eyes of the girl.
<p/>Emmeline did not faint, and succeeded in plunging, with Cassy, into a part of the labyrinth of swamp, so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for Legree to think of following them, without assistance.
<p/>Legree, who was pursuing them with violent execrations. '' The diversion accomplished the purpose. '' Well,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), chuckling brutally; <div class="bookquote">``at any rate, they've got themselves into a trap now--the baggage!
<p/>They're safe enough. They shall sweat for it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hulloa, there! Sambo! Quimbo! All hands! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>called Legree, coming to the quarters, when the men and women were just returning from work.
<p/>'' There's two runaways in the swamps. I'll give five dollars to any nigger as catches 'em. Turn out the dogs!
<p/>Many of the men sprang forward, officiously, to offer their services, either from the hope of the reward, or from that cringing subserviency which is one of the most baleful effects of slavery.
<p/>Turn out Tiger, and Fury, and the rest!'' The sensation produced by this news was immediate. Some ran one way, and some another.
<p/>Some were for getting flambeaux of pine-knots. Some were uncoupling the dogs, whose hoarse, savage bay added not a little to the animation of the scene.
<p/>'' Mas'r , shall we shoot 'em, if can't cotch 'em?'' said Sambo, to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) master brought out a rifle.
<p/>You may fire on Cass, if you like; it's time she (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) was gone to the devil, where she (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) belongs; but the gal, not,'' said Legree.
<p/>'' '' And now, boys, be spry and smart. Five dollars for him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) that gets 'em; and a glass of spirits to every one of you, anyhow.
<p/>The whole band, with the glare of blazing torches, and whoop, and shout, and savage yell, of man and beast, proceeded down to the swamp, followed, at some distance, by every servant in the house.
<p/>The whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room windows, Cassy and Emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux, just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp.
<p/>'' The establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when Cassy and Emmeline glided into it the back way. <div class="bookquote">``See there!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline, pointing to Cassy; <div class="bookquote">``the hunt is begun!
<p/>Look how those lights dance about! Hark! the dogs! Don't you hear? If we were only there , our chances wouldn't be worth a picayune.
<p/>O, for pity's sake, do let's hide ourselves. Quick!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>'' There's no occasion for hurry,'' said Cassy, coolly; <div class="bookquote">``they are all out after the hunt,--that's the amusement of the evening!
<p/>Meanwhile,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cassy</b></font>), deliberately taking a key from the pocket of a coat that Legree had thrown down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hurry, <div class="bookquote">``meanwhile I shall take something to pay our passage.
<p/>We'll go up stairs, by and by. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Cassy</b></font>) unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Cassy</b></font>) counted over rapidly.
<p/>'' O, don't let's do that!'' said Emmeline. '' Don't!'' said Cassy; <div class="bookquote">``why not? Would you have us starve in the swamps, or have that that will pay our way to the free states.
<p/>Money will do anything, girl. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>And, as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) put the money in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bosom. '' It would be stealing,'' said Emmeline, in a distressed whisper.
<p/>Every one of these bills is stolen,--stolen from poor, starving, sweating creatures, who must go to the devil at last, for his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) profit.
<p/>'' Stealing!'' said Cassy, with a scornful laugh. '' They who steal body and soul needn't talk to us. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) talk about stealing!
<p/>But come, we may as well go up garret; I've got a stock of candles there, and some books to pass away the time.
<p/>You may be pretty sure they won't come there to inquire after us. If they do, I'll play ghost for them.
<p/>When Emmeline reached the garret, she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) found an immense box, in which some heavy pieces of furniture had once been brought, turned on its side, so that the opening faced the wall, or rather the eaves.
<p/>It was spread with a couple of small mattresses and some pillows; a box near by was plentifully stored with candles, provisions, and all the clothing necessary to their journey, which Cassy had arranged into bundles of an astonishingly small compass.
<p/>There,'' said Cassy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) fixed the lamp into a small hook, which she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had driven into the side of the box for that purpose; <div class="bookquote">``this is to be our home for the present.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Cassy lit a small lamp, and creeping round under the eaves, they established themselves in it. '' How do you like it?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure they won't come and search the garret?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'd like to see Simon Legree doing that,'' said Cassy.
<p/>'' No, indeed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) will be too glad to keep away. As to the servants, they would any of them stand and be shot, sooner than show their faces here.
<p/>'' Somewhat reassured, Emmeline settled herself back on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pillow. '' What did you mean, Cassy, by saying you would kill me?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said, simply. '' I meant to stop your fainting,'' said Cassy, <div class="bookquote">``and I did do it. And now I tell you, Emmeline, you must make up your mind not to faint, let what will come
<p/>; there's no sort of need of it. If I had not stopped you, that wretch might have had his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands on you now.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>Emmeline shuddered. The two remained some time in silence. Cassy busied herself with a French book; Emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze, and slept some time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the tramp of horses' feet, and the baying of dogs. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) started up, with a faint shriek.
<p/>'' Only the hunt coming back,'' said Cassy, coolly; <div class="bookquote">``never fear. Look out of this knot-hole. Don't you see 'em all down there?
<p/>Simon has to give up, for this night. Look, how muddy his (<font color='blue'><b>Simon</b></font>) horse is, flouncing about in the swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen.
<p/>Ah, my good sir, you'll have to try the race again and again,--the game isn't there.''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``O, don't speak a word!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline; <div class="bookquote">``what if they should hear you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div><p/>'' If they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep away,'' said Cassy. '' No danger; we may make any noise we please, and it will only add to the effect.
<p/>'' At length the stillness of midnight settled down over the house. Legree, cursing his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) ill luck, and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow, went to bed.
<p/>CHAPTER XL The Martyr <div class="bookquote">``Deem not the just by Heaven forgot! Though life its common gifts deny,-- Though, with a crushed and bleeding heart, And spurned of man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) goes to die!
<p/>For God hath marked each sorrowing day, And numbered every bitter tear, And heaven's long years of bliss shall pay For all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) children suffer here.
<p/>This poem does not appear in the collected works of William Cullen Bryant, nor in the collected poems of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bryant</b></font>) brother, John Howard Bryant.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Martyr</b></font>)</div>BRYANT. * * It was probably copied from a newspaper or magazine. The longest way must have its close,--the gloomiest night will wear on to a morning.
<p/>An eternal, inexorable lapse of moments is ever hurrying the day of the evil to an eternal night, and the night of the just to an eternal day.
<p/>We have walked with our humble friend thus far in the valley of slavery; first through flowery fields of ease and indulgence, then through heart-breaking separations from all that man holds dear.
<p/>Again, we have waited with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a sunny island, where generous hands concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chains with flowers; and, lastly, we have followed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when the last ray of earthly hope went out in night, and seen how, in the blackness of earthly darkness, the firmament of the unseen has blazed with stars of new and significant lustre.
<p/>The morning-star now stands over the tops of the mountains, and gales and breezes, not of earth, show that the gates of day are unclosing.
<p/>The escape of Cassy and Emmeline irritated the before surly temper of Legree to the last degree; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fury, as was to be expected, fell upon the defenceless head of Tom.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hurriedly announced the tidings among his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands, there was a sudden light in Tom's eye, a sudden upraising of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hands, that did not escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought of forcing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to do it; but, having had, of old, experience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) inflexibility when commanded to take part in any deed of inhumanity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would not, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hurry, stop to enter into any conflict with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>Tom, therefore, remained behind, with a few who had learned of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to pray, and offered up prayers for the escape of the fugitives.
<p/>When Legree returned, baffled and disappointed, all the long-working hatred of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) soul towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) slave began to gather in a deadly and desperate form.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) did not join the muster of the pursuers. Had not this man braved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),--steadily, powerfully, resistlessly,--ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>Was there not a spirit in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) which, silent as it was, burned on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like the fires of perdition? ''
<p/>I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'' said Legree, that night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) sat up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) bed; <div class="bookquote">``I hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)! And isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) MINE?
<p/>And Legree clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fist, and shook it, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) hands that he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) could rend in pieces.
<p/>But, then, Tom was a faithful, valuable servant; and, although Legree hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) the more for that, yet the consideration was still somewhat of a restraint to him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>The next morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) determined to say nothing, as yet; to assemble a party, from some neighboring plantations, with dogs and guns; to surround the swamp, and go about the hunt systematically.
<p/>If it succeeded, well and good; if not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) would summon Tom before him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and--his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) teeth clenched and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) blood boiled--
<p/>Can't I do what I like with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)? Who's to hinder, I wonder? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would break the fellow down, or--there was a dire inward whisper, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) soul assented.
<p/>In the fury of man's mad will, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) will wittingly, and with open eye, sell his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own soul to the devil to gain his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ends; and will he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) be more careful of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) neighbor's body?
<p/>Well,'' said Cassy, the next day, from the garret, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) reconnoitred through the knot-hole, <div class="bookquote">``the hunt's going to begin again, today!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Three or four mounted horsemen were curvetting about, on the space in front of the house; and one or two leashes of strange dogs were struggling with the negroes who held them, baying and barking at each other.
<p/>The men are, two of them, overseers of plantations in the vicinity; and others were some of Legree's associates at the tavern-bar of a neighboring city, who had come for the interest of the sport.
<p/>Ye say that the interest of the master is a sufficient safeguard for the slave. '' A more hard-favored set, perhaps, could not be imagined.
<p/>Legree was serving brandy, profusely, round among them, as also among the negroes, who had been detailed from the various plantations for this service; for it was an object to make every service of this kind, among the negroes, as much of a holiday as possible.
<p/>Cassy placed her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ear at the knot-hole; and, as the morning air blew directly towards the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could overhear a good deal of the conversation.
<p/>A grave sneer overcast the dark, severe gravity of her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) face, as she (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) listened, and heard them divide out the ground, discuss the rival merits of the dogs, give orders about firing, and the treatment of each, in case of capture.
<p/>we are all sinners; but what have we done, more than all the rest of the world, that we should be treated so?
<p/>Cassy drew back; and, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hands, looked upward, and said, <div class="bookquote">``O, great Almighty God! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>There was a terrible earnestness in her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) face and voice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>If it wasn't for you , child,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said, looking at Emmeline, <div class="bookquote">``I'd go out to them; and I'd thank any one of them that would shoot me down; for what use will freedom be to me?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>Can it give me back my children, or make me what I used to be? '' Emmeline, in her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) child-like simplicity, was half afraid of the dark moods of Cassy.
<p/>Don't!'' said Cassy, trying to draw it away; <div class="bookquote">``you'll get me to loving you; and I never mean to love anything, again!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) looked perplexed, but made no answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) only took her (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hand, with a gentle, caressing movement. '' <div class="bookquote">``Poor Cassy!''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline, <div class="bookquote">``don't feel so!
<p/>If the Lord gives us liberty, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'ll give you back your daughter; at any rate, I'll be like a daughter to you.
<p/>I know I'll never see my poor old mother again! I shall love you, Cassy, whether you love me or not!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div><p/>Cassy sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), put her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) neck, stroked her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soft, brown hair; and Emmeline then wondered at the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) magnificent eyes, now soft with tears.
<p/>The gentle, child-like spirit conquered. '' O, Em! '' said Cassy, <div class="bookquote">``I've hungered for my children, and thirsted for them, and my eyes fail with longing for them!
<p/>Here! here! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, striking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast, <div class="bookquote">``it's all desolate, all empty! If God would give me back my children, then I could pray.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You must trust him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), Cassy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is our Father!''

 (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div><p/>The hunt was long, animated, and thorough, but unsuccessful; and, with grave, ironic exultation, Cassy looked down on Legree, as, weary and dispirited, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) alighted from his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) horse.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, Cassy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) will be good to us! Let us hope in Him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>said Emmeline,--<div class="bookquote">``I always have had hope. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Emmeline</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Now, Quimbo,'' said Legree, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) stretched himself down in the sitting-room, <div class="bookquote">``you jest go and walk that Tom up here, right away!
<p/>The old cuss is at the bottom of this yer whole matter; and I'll have it out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) old black hide, or I'll know the reason why!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sambo and Quimbo, both, though hating each other, were joined in one mind by a no less cordial hatred of Tom.
<p/>Legree had told them, at first, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had bought him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) for a general overseer, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) absence; and this had begun an ill will, on their part, which had increased, in their debased and servile natures, as they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) becoming obnoxious to their master's displeasure.
<p/>Tom heard the message with a forewarning heart; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew all the plan of the fugitives' escape, and the place of their present concealment;--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knew the deadly character of the man he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had to deal with, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) despotic power.
<p/>Quimbo, therefore, departed, with a will, to execute his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) orders. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) felt strong in God to meet death, rather than betray the helpless.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sat his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) basket down by the row, and, looking up, said, <div class="bookquote">``Into thy hands I commend my spirit! Thou hast redeemed me,
<p/>oh Lord God of truth! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and then quietly yielded himself to the rough, brutal grasp with which Quimbo seized him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>'' Ay, ay!'' said the giant, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) along; <div class="bookquote">``ye'll cotch it, now! I'll boun' Mas`r's back 's up high!

<p/>See what ye'll get!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The savage words none of them reached that ear!--a higher voice there was saying, <div class="bookquote">``Fear not them that kill the body, and, after that, have no more that they can do.
<p/>Nerve and bone of that poor man's body vibrated to those words, as if touched by the finger of God; and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt the strength of a thousand souls in one.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) passed along, the trees and bushes, the huts of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) servitude, the whole scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) degradation, seemed to whirl by him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as the landscape by the rushing ear.
<p/>Well, Tom!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, walking up, and seizing him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) grimly by the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) coat, and speaking through his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) teeth, in a paroxysm of determined rage, <div class="bookquote">``do you know I've made up my mind to KILL YOU?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) soul throbbed,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) home was in sight,--and the hour of release seemed at hand. '' '' It's very likely, Mas`r,'' said Tom, calmly.
<p/>I have ,'' said Legree, with a grim, terrible calmness, '' done--just--that--thing , Tom, unless you'll tell me what you know about these yer gals!''
<p/>'' Tom stood silent. '' D'ye hear?'' said Legree, stamping, with a roar like that of an incensed lion. <div class="bookquote">``Speak!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>I han't got nothing to tell, Mas'r ,'' said Tom, with a slow, firm, deliberate utterance. '' Do you dare to tell me, ye old black Christian, ye don't know ?'' said Legree.
<p/>Tom was silent. <div class="bookquote">``Speak! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>thundered Legree, striking him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) furiously. '' Do you know anything?'' ``I know, Mas`r; but I can't tell anything.
<p/>Legree drew in a long breath; and, suppressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) rage, took Tom by the arm, and, approaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), said, in a terrible voice, <div class="bookquote">``Hark `e, Tom!--ye think, 'cause I've let you off before, I don't mean what I say; but, this time, I've made up my mind , and counted the cost.
<p/>I can die! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>You've always stood it out again ' me: now, I'll conquer ye, or kill ye! --one or t' other.
<p/>Tom looked up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master, and answered, <div class="bookquote">``Mas`r, if you was sick, or in trouble, or dying, and I could save ye
<p/>, I'd give ye my heart's blood; and, if taking every drop of blood in this poor old body would save your precious soul, I'd give 'em freely, as the Lord gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) for me.
<p/>I'll count every drop of blood there is in you, and take 'em, one by one, till ye give up!''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>O, Mas`r! don't bring this great sin on your soul!
<p/>It will hurt you more than 't will me! Do the worst you can, my troubles'll be over soon; but, if ye don't repent, yours won't never end!
<p/>Like a strange snatch of heavenly music, heard in the lull of a tempest, this burst of feeling made a moment's blank pause.
<p/>Legree stood aghast, and looked at Tom; and there was such a silence, that the tick of the old clock could be heard, measuring, with silent touch, the last moments of mercy and probation to that hardened heart.
<p/>'' It was but a moment. There was one hesitating pause,--one irresolute, relenting thrill,--and the spirit of evil came back, with seven-fold vehemence; and Legree, foaming with rage, smote his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) victim to the ground.
<p/>Scenes of blood and cruelty are shocking to our ear and heart. What man has nerve to do, man has not nerve to hear.
<p/>What brother-man and brother-Christian must suffer, cannot be told us, even in our secret chamber, it so harrows the soul! And yet, oh my country!
<p/>But, of old, there was One whose suffering changed an instrument of torture, degradation and shame, into a symbol of glory, honor, and immortal life; and, where His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spirit is, neither degrading stripes, nor blood, nor insults, can make the Christian's last struggle less than glorious.
<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) alone, that long night, whose brave, loving spirit was bearing up, in that old shed, against buffeting and brutal stripes?
<p/>these things are done under the shadow of thy laws! O, Christ! thy church sees them, almost in silence! Nay! There stood by him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) ONE,--seen by him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) alone,--<div class="bookquote">``like unto the Son of God.
<p/>The tempter stood by him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), too,--blinded by furious, despotic will,--every moment pressing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to shun that agony by the betrayal of the innocent.
<p/>Like his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Master, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew that, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saved others, himself he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not save; nor could utmost extremity wring from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words, save of prayers and holy trust.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But the brave, true heart was firm on the Eternal Rock. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)'s most gone, Mas`r,'' said Sambo, touched, in spite of himself, by the patience of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) victim.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Pay away, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) gives up!

'' I'll take every drop of blood he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) has, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) confesses!''
<p/>Tom opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, and looked upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) master. '' Ye poor miserable critter!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``there ain't no more ye can do!
<p/>I forgive ye, with all my soul!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) fainted entirely away. '' I b`lieve, my soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s done for, finally,'' said Legree, stepping forward, to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>'' Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) is! Well, his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mouth's shut up, at last,--that's one comfort! '' Yes, Legree; but who shall shut up that voice in thy soul?
<p/>that soul, past repentance, past prayer, past hope, in whom the fire that never shall be quenched is already burning! Yet Tom was not quite gone.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wondrous words and pious prayers had struck upon the hearts of the imbruted blacks, who had been the instruments of cruelty upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>); and, the instant Legree withdrew, they took him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) down, and, in their ignorance, sought to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) back to life,--as if that were any favor to him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>Sartin, we 's been doin' a drefful wicked thing!'' said Sambo; <div class="bookquote">``hopes Mas`r'll have to `count for it, and not we.
<p/>They washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) wounds,--they provided a rude bed, of some refuse cotton, for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sambo</b></font>) to lie down on; and one of them, stealing up to the house, begged a drink of brandy of Legree, pretending that he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was tired, and wanted it for himself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Sambo</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) brought it back, and poured it down Tom's throat. '' O, Tom!'' said Quimbo, <div class="bookquote">``we's been awful wicked to ye!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Quimbo</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I forgive ye, with all my heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, faintly. '' O, Tom! do tell us who is Jesus , anyhow?

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) poured forth a few energetic sentences of that wondrous One,--his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) life, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) death, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) everlasting presence, and power to save.
<p/>They wept,--both the two savage men. '' Why didn't I never hear this before?'' said Sambo; <div class="bookquote">``but I do believe!--I can't help it!

<p/>Two days after, a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue of China trees, and, throwing the reins hastily on the horse's neck, sprang out and inquired for the owner of the place.
<p/>O, Lord! give me these two more souls, I pray! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>That prayer was answered! CHAPTER XLI The Young Master It was George Shelby; and, to show how he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) came to be there, we must go back in our story.
<p/>The letter of Miss Ophelia to Mrs. Shelby had, by some unfortunate accident, been detained, for a month or two, at some remote post-office, before it reached its destination; and, of course, before it was received, Tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the Red River.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern; but any immediate action upon it was an impossibility. She (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) was then in attendance on the sick-bed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) husband, who lay delirious in the crisis of a fever.
<p/>Master George Shelby, who, in the interval, had changed from a boy to a tall young man, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) constant and faithful assistant, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) only reliance in superintending his (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) father's affairs.
<p/>Miss Ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the lawyer who did business for the St. Clares; and the most that, in the emergency, could be done, was to address a letter of inquiry to him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>).
<p/>The sudden death of Mr. Shelby, a few days after, brought, of course, an absorbing pressure of other interests, for a season.
<p/>Mr. Shelby showed his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) wife's ability, by appointing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sole executrix upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) estates; and thus immediately a large and complicated amount of business was brought upon her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby, with characteristic energy, applied herself to the work of straightening the entangled web of affairs; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) and George were for some time occupied with collecting and examining accounts, selling property and settling debts; for Mrs. Shelby was determined that everything should be brought into tangible and recognizable shape, let the consequences to her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) prove what they might.
<p/>In the mean time, they received a letter from the lawyer to whom Miss Ophelia had referred them, saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) knew nothing of the matter; that the man was sold at a public auction, and that, beyond receiving the money, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew nothing of the affair.
<p/>Neither George nor Mrs. Shelby could be easy at this result; and, accordingly, some six months after, the latter, having business for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother, down the river, resolved to visit New Orleans, in person, and push his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) inquiries, in hopes of discovering Tom's whereabouts, and restoring him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
<p/>After some months of unsuccessful search, by the merest accident, George fell in with a man, in New Orleans, who happened to be possessed of the desired information; and with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) money in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) pocket, our hero took steamboat for Red River, resolving to find out and re-purchase his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) old friend.
<p/>Legree received the stranger with a kind of surly hospitality, <div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>said the young man, ``that you bought, in New Orleans, a boy, named Tom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was soon introduced into the house, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) found Legree in the sitting-room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) used to be on my father's place, and I came to see if I couldn't buy him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back.
<p/>Legree's brow grew dark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) broke out, passionately: <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I did buy such a fellow,--and a h--l of a bargain I had of it, too!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The most rebellious, saucy, impudent dog! Set up my niggers to run away; got off two gals, worth eight hundred or a thousand apiece.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) owned to that, and, when I bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) tell me where they was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) up and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) knew, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) wouldn't tell; and stood to it, though I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) the cussedest flogging I ever gave nigger yet.
<p/>I b`lieve he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)'s trying to die; but I don't know as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)'ll make it out. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, impetuously.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>The cheeks of the young man were crimson, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes flashed fire; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prudently said nothing, as yet.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s in dat ar shed,'' said a little fellow, who stood holding George's horse. Legree kicked the boy, and swore at him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>); but George, without saying another word, turned and strode to the spot.
<p/>Tom had been lying two days since the fatal night, not suffering, for every nerve of suffering was blunted and destroyed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lay, for the most part, in a quiet stupor; for the laws of a powerful and well-knit frame would not at once release the imprisoned spirit.
<p/>By stealth, there had been there, in the darkness of the night, poor desolated creatures, who stole from their scanty hours' rest, that they might repay to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) some of those ministrations of love in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had always been so abundant.
<p/>Tears had fallen on that honest, insensible face,--tears of late repentance in the poor, ignorant heathen, whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dying love and patience had awakened to repentance, and bitter prayers, breathed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to a late-found Saviour, of whom they scarce knew more than the name, but whom the yearning ignorant heart of man never implores in vain.
<p/>Cassy, who had glided out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) place of concealment, and, by overhearing, learned the sacrifice that had been made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) and Emmeline, had been there, the night before, defying the danger of detection; and, moved by the last few words which the affectionate soul had yet strength to breathe, the long winter of despair, the ice of years, had given way, and the dark, despairing woman had wept and prayed.
<p/>Truly, those poor disciples had little to give,--only the cup of cold water; but it was given with full hearts. When George entered the shed, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) head giddy and his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heart sick.
<p/>'' Is it possible,--is it possible?'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), kneeling down by him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>). '' Uncle Tom, my poor, poor old friend!'' Something in the voice penetrated to the ear of the dying.
<p/>Tears which did honor to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) manly heart fell from the young man's eyes, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) poor friend.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) moved his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head gently, smiled, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Jesus can make a dying-bed Feel soft as down pillows are. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>O, dear Uncle Tom! do wake,--do speak once more! Look up! Here's Mas'r George,--your own little Mas'r George. Don't you know me?''
<p/>Slowly the idea seemed to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) soul; and the vacant eye became fixed and brightened, the whole face lighted up, the hard hands clasped, and tears ran down the cheeks.
<p/>'' Mas'r George! '' said Tom, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eyes, and speaking in a feeble voice; <div class="bookquote">``Mas'r George!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looked bewildered. ''
<p/>Bless the Lord! it is,--it is,--it's all I wanted! They haven't forgot me. It warms my soul; it does my heart good!
<p/>Now I shall die content! Bless the Lord, on my soul!'' <div class="bookquote">``You shan't die! you mustn't die, nor think of it!
<p/>I've come to buy you, and take you home,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, with impetuous vehemence. '' O, Mas'r George, ye're too late.
<p/>The Lord's bought me, and is going to take me home,--and I long to go. Heaven is better than Kintuck. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, don't die! It'll kill me!--it'll break my heart to think what you've suffered,--and lying in this old shed, here! Poor, poor fellow!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't call me poor fellow!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, solemnly, <div class="bookquote">``I have been poor fellow; but that's all past and gone, now.
<p/>I'm right in the door, going into glory! O, Mas'r George! Heaven has come! I've got the victory!--the Lord Jesus has given it to me!
<p/>Glory be to His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) name!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>George was awe-struck at the force, the vehemence, the power, with which these broken sentences were uttered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sat gazing in silence. Tom grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand, and continued,--<div class="bookquote">``Ye mustn't, now, tell Chloe, poor soul! how ye found me;--'t would be so drefful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>).
<p/>Only tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) ye found me going into glory; and that I couldn't stay for no one. And tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) the Lord's stood by me everywhere and al`ays, and made everything light and easy.
<p/>And oh, the poor chil`en, and the baby;--my old heart's been most broke for 'em, time and agin! Tell 'em all to follow me--follow me!
<p/>Give my love to Mas`r, and dear good Missis, and everybody in the place! Ye don't know! ' Pears like I loves 'em all!
<p/>At this moment, Legree sauntered up to the door of the shed, looked in, with a dogged air of affected carelessness, and turned away.
<p/>I loves every creature everywhar!--it's nothing but love! O, Mas'r George! what a thing 't is to be a Christian!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>The old Satan! '' said George, in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) indignation. '' It's a comfort to think the devil will pay him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) for this, some of these days!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, don't!--oh, ye mustn't!''  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div>said Tom, grasping his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s a poor mis`able critter! it's awful to think on `t! Oh, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) only could repent, the Lord would forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) now; but I'm `feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) never will!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Loker/Loker</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) won't!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George; <div class="bookquote">``I never want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) in heaven!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hush, Mas'r George!--it worries me! Don't feel so!
<p/>At this moment, the sudden flush of strength which the joy of meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) young master had infused into the dying man gave way.
<p/>A sudden sinking fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes; and that mysterious and sublime change passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, that told the approach of other worlds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an't done me no real harm,--only opened the gate of the kingdom for me; that's all! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to draw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath with long, deep inspirations; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broad chest rose and fell, heavily.
<p/>The expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face was that of a conqueror. '' Who,--who,--who shall separate us from the love of Christ? ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said, in a voice that contended with mortal weakness; and, with a smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) fell asleep. George sat fixed with solemn awe.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) that the place was holy; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) closed the lifeless eyes, and rose up from the dead, only one thought possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>),--that expressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) simple old friend,--<div class="bookquote">``What a thing it is to be a Christian!''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend thing</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned: Legree was standing, sullenly, behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>). Something in that dying scene had checked the natural fierceness of youthful passion.
<p/>The presence of the man was simply loathsome to George; and he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt only an impulse to get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), with as few words as possible.
<p/>Fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) keen dark eyes on Legree, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) simply said, pointing to the dead, <div class="bookquote">``You have got all you ever can of him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>What shall I pay you for the body? I will take it away, and bury it decently. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't sell dead niggers,''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, doggedly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, in an authoritative tone, to two or three negroes, who were looking at the body, <div class="bookquote">``help me lift him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) up, and carry him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to my wagon; and get me a spade.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>negroes</b></font>)</div>You are welcome to bury him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) where and when you like.'' '' One of them ran for a spade; the other two assisted George to carry the body to the wagon.
<p/>George neither spoke to nor looked at Legree, who did not countermand his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) orders, but stood, whistling, with an air of forced unconcern.
<p/>George spread his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) cloak in the wagon, and had the body carefully disposed of in it,--moving the seat, so as to give it room.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) turned, fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) eyes on Legree, and said, with forced composure, <div class="bookquote">``I have not, as yet, said to you what I think of this most atrocious affair;--this is not the time and place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) sulkily followed them to where the wagon stood at the door. But, sir, this innocent blood shall have justice. I will proclaim this murder.
<p/>I will go to the very first magistrate, and expose you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do!''  (<font color='red'><b>Legree/Simon/Simon Legree</b></font>)</div>said Legree, snapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) fingers, scornfully. '' I'd like to see you doing it.
<p/>Where you going to get witnesses?--how you going to prove it?--Come, now!'' George saw, at once, the force of this defiance.
<p/>There was not a white person on the place; and, in all southern courts, the testimony of colored blood is nothing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) felt, at that moment, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could have rent the heavens with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) heart's indignant cry for justice; but in vain.
<p/>'' After all, what a fuss, for a dead nigger!'' said Legree. The word was as a spark to a powder magazine.
<p/>George turned, and, with one indignant blow, knocked Legree flat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) face; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), blazing with wrath and defiance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) would have formed no bad personification of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) great namesake triumphing over the dragon.
<p/>If a man lays them fairly flat in the dust, they seem immediately to conceive a respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and Legree was one of this sort.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) rose, therefore, and brushed the dust from his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) clothes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) eyed the slowly-retreating wagon with some evident consideration; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) open his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) mouth till it was out of sight.
<p/>Beyond the boundaries of the plantation, George had noticed a dry, sandy knoll, shaded by a few trees; there they made the grave.
<p/>Prudence was never a cardinal virtue of the Kentucky boy. Some men, however, are decidedly bettered by being knocked down. ''
<p/>Shall we take off the cloak, Mas`r? '' said the negroes, when the grave was ready. '' No, no,--bury it with him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)!
<p/>It's all I can give you, now, poor Tom, and you shall have it. '' They laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in; and the men shovelled away, silently.
<p/>They banked it up, and laid green turf over it. '' You may go, boys,'' said George, slipping a quarter into the hand of each.
<p/>They lingered about, however. '' If young Mas'r would please buy us--'' said one. '' We'd serve him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) so faithful!'' said the other.
<p/>'' Hard times here, Mas`r!'' said the first. '' Do, Mas`r, buy us, please!'' <div class="bookquote">``I can't!--I can't!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, with difficulty, motioning them off; <div class="bookquote">``it's impossible!
<p/>Witness, eternal God!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, kneeling on the grave of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) poor friend; <div class="bookquote">``oh, witness, that, from this hour, I will do what one man can to drive out this curse of slavery from my land!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>The poor fellows looked dejected, and walked off in silence. '' '' There is no monument to mark the last resting-place of our friend.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) needs none! Pity him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) not! Such a life and death is not for pity! Not in the riches of omnipotence is the chief glory of God; but in self-denying, suffering love!
<p/>And blessed are the men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) calls to fellowship with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), bearing their cross after him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with patience. Of such it is written, <div class="bookquote">``Blessed are they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.''
 (<font color='red'><b>An Ghost Story</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XLII An Authentic Ghost Story For some remarkable reason, ghostly legends were uncommonly rife, about this time, among the servants on Legree's place.
<p/>It was whisperingly asserted that footsteps, in the dead of night, had been heard descending the garret stairs, and patrolling the house.
<p/>In vain the doors of the upper entry had been locked; the ghost either carried a duplicate key in its pocket, or availed itself of a ghost's immemorial privilege of coming through the keyhole, and promenaded as before, with a freedom that was alarming.
<p/>Authorities were somewhat divided, as to the outward form of the spirit, owing to a custom quite prevalent among negroes,--and, for aught we know, among whites, too,--of invariably shutting the eyes, and covering up heads under blankets, petticoats, or whatever else might come in use for a shelter, on these occasions.
<p/>Of course, as everybody knows, when the bodily eyes are thus out of the lists, the spiritual eyes are uncommonly vivacious and perspicuous; and, therefore, there were abundance of full-length portraits of the ghost, abundantly sworn and testified to, which, as is often the case with portraits, agreed with each other in no particular, except the common family peculiarity of the ghost tribe,--the wearing of a white sheet .
<p/>The poor souls were not versed in ancient history, and did not know that Shakspeare had authenticated this costume, by telling how <div class="bookquote">``The sheeted dead Did squeak and gibber in the streets of Rome.
<p/>And, therefore, their all hitting upon this is a striking fact in pneumatology, which we recommend to the attention of spiritual media generally.
<p/>Be it as it may, we have private reasons for knowing that a tall figure in a white sheet did walk, at the most approved ghostly hours, around the Legree premises,--pass out the doors, glide about the house,--disappear at intervals, and, reappearing, pass up the silent stairway, into that fatal garret; and that, in the morning, the entry doors were all found shut and locked as firm as ever.
<p/>Legree could not help overhearing this whispering; and it was all the more exciting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>), from the pains that were taken to conceal it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) drank more brandy than usual; held up his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) head briskly, and swore louder than ever in the daytime; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) had bad dreams, and the visions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) head on his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) bed were anything but agreeable.
<p/>The night after Tom's body had been carried away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rode to the next town for a carouse, and had a high one.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The souls</b></font>)</div>* * Hamlet , Act I, scene 1, lines 115-116 Got home late and tired; locked his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) door, took out the key, and went to bed.
<p/>After all, let a man take what pains he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may to hush it down, a human soul is an awful ghostly, unquiet possession, for a bad man to have.
<p/>Who knows all its awful perhapses,--those shudderings and tremblings, which it can no more live down than it can outlive its own eternity!
<p/>What a fool is he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) who locks his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) door to keep out spirits, who has in his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own bosom a spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) dares not meet alone,--whose voice, smothered far down, and piled over with mountains of earthliness, is yet like the forewarning trumpet of doom!
<p/>But Legree locked his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) door and set a chair against it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) set a night-lamp at the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) bed; and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) pistols there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) examined the catches and fastenings of the windows, and then swore he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``didn't care for the devil and all his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) angels,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and went to sleep.
<p/>Who knows the metes and bounds of it? Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) slept, for he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was tired,--slept soundly. But, finally, there came over his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sleep a shadow, a horror, an apprehension of something dreadful hanging over him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) heard a confused noise of screams and groanings; and, with it all, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was asleep, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) struggled to wake himself.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) mother's shroud, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) thought; but Cassy had it, holding it up, and showing it to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was half awake.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was sure something was coming into his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) room. He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knew the door was opening, but he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could not stir hand or foot.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) turned, with a start; the door was open, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) saw a hand putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) light. It was a cloudy, misty moonlight, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) saw it!--something white, gliding in!
<p/>It stood still by his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) bed;--a cold hand touched his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>); a voice said, three times, in a low, fearful whisper, <div class="bookquote">``Come!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) heard the still rustle of its ghostly garments. come! come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And, while he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) lay sweating with terror, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knew not when or how, the thing was gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sprang out of bed, and pulled at the door. It was shut and locked, and the man fell down in a swoon.
<p/>After this, Legree became a harder drinker than ever before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) no longer drank cautiously, prudently, but imprudently and recklessly. There were reports around the country, soon after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) was sick and dying.
<p/>Excess had brought on that frightful disease that seems to throw the lurid shadows of a coming retribution back into the present life.
<p/>None could bear the horrors of that sick room, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) raved and screamed, and spoke of sights which almost stopped the blood of those who heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>); and, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Legree</b></font>) dying bed, stood a stern, white, inexorable figure, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Come!
<p/>By a singular coincidence, on the very night that this vision appeared to Legree, the house-door was found open in the morning, and some of the negroes had seen two white figures gliding down the avenue towards the high-road.
<p/>It was near sunrise when Cassy and Emmeline paused, for a moment, in a little knot of trees near the town.
<p/>come! come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Cassy was dressed after the manner of the Creole Spanish ladies,--wholly in black. A small black bonnet on her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) head, covered by a veil thick with embroidery, concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) face.
<p/>It had been agreed that, in their escape, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was to personate the character of a Creole lady, and Emmeline that of her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) servant.
<p/>Brought up, from early life, in connection with the highest society, the language, movements and air of Cassy, were all in agreement with this idea; and she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had still enough remaining with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), of a once splendid wardrobe, and sets of jewels, to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) to personate the thing to advantage.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) stopped in the outskirts of the town, where she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had noticed trunks for sale, and purchased a handsome one. This
<p/>And, accordingly, thus escorted by a boy wheeling her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) trunk, and Emmeline behind her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) carpet-bag and sundry bundles, she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) appearance at the small tavern, like a lady of consideration.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) requested the man to send along with her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>). The first person that struck her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), after her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) arrival, was George Shelby, who was staying there, awaiting the next boat.
<p/>Cassy had remarked the young man from her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) loophole in the garret, and seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bear away the body of Tom, and observed with secret exultation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) rencontre with Legree.
<p/>Subsequently she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had gathered, from the conversations she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had overheard among the negroes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) glided about in her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) ghostly disguise, after nightfall, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was, and in what relation he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood to Tom.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), therefore, felt an immediate accession of confidence, when she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was, like herself, awaiting the next boat. Cassy's air and manner, address, and evident command of money, prevented any rising disposition to suspicion in the hotel.
<p/>People never inquire too closely into those who are fair on the main point, of paying well,--a thing which Cassy had foreseen when she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) provided herself with money.
<p/>In the edge of the evening, a boat was heard coming along, and George Shelby handed Cassy aboard, with the politeness which comes naturally to every Kentuckian, and exerted himself to provide her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) with a good state-room.
<p/>Cassy kept her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) room and bed, on pretext of illness, during the whole time they were on Red River; and was waited on, with obsequious devotion, by her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) attendant.
<p/>When they arrived at the Mississippi river, George, having learned that the course of the strange lady was upward, like his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own, proposed to take a state-room for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) on the same boat with himself,--good-naturedly compassionating her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) feeble health, and desirous to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>Behold, therefore, the whole party safely transferred to the good steamer Cincinnati, and sweeping up the river under a powerful head of steam.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat upon the guards, came to the table, and was remarked upon in the boat as a lady that must have been very handsome.
<p/>From the moment that George got the first glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was troubled with one of those fleeting and indefinite likenesses, which almost every body can remember, and has been, at times, perplexed with.
<p/>At table, or sitting at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) state-room door, still she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would encounter the young man's eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and politely withdrawn, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) showed, by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) countenance, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was sensible to the observation.
<p/>Cassy's health was much better. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not keep himself from looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and watching her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) perpetually. Cassy became uneasy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) began to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suspected something; and finally resolved to throw herself entirely on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) generosity, and intrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whole history.
<p/>George was heartily disposed to sympathize with any one who had escaped from Legree's plantation,--a place that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could not remember or speak of with patience,--and, with the courageous disregard of consequences which is characteristic of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) age and state, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would do all in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) power to protect and bring them through.
<p/>The next state-room to Cassy's was occupied by a French lady, named De Thoux, who was accompanied by a fine little daughter, a child of some twelve summers.
<p/>This lady, having gathered, from George's conversation, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was from Kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) acquaintance; in which design she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was seconded by the graces of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little girl, who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight's trip on a steamboat.
<p/>George's chair was often placed at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) state-room door; and Cassy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation.
<p/>Madame de Thoux was very minute in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) inquiries as to Kentucky, where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had resided in a former period of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) life.
<p/>George discovered, to his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) surprise, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) former residence must have been in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) own vicinity; and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) inquiries showed a knowledge of people and things in his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>).
<p/>Do you know,'' said Madame de Thoux to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thoux</b></font>), one day, <div class="bookquote">``of any man, in your neighborhood, of the name of Harris?''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' There is an old fellow, of that name, lives not far from my father's place,'' said George. '' We never have had much intercourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), though.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is a large slave-owner, I believe,'' said Madame de Thoux, with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) was exactly willing to show.
<p/>'' '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Thoux</b></font>) is,'' said George, looking rather surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) manner. '' Did you ever know of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) having--perhaps, you may have heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) having a mulatto boy, named George?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O, certainly,--George Harris,--I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) well; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) married a servant of my mother's, but has escaped, now, to Canada.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) has?'' said Madame de Thoux, quickly.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>George looked a surprised inquiry, but said nothing. Madame de Thoux leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand, and burst into tears.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is my brother,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Madame!''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, with a strong accent of surprise. '' Yes,'' said Madame de Thoux, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head, proudly, and wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tears, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Shelby, George Harris is my brother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Thoux/De Thoux</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am perfectly astonished,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, pushing back his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) chair a pace or two, and looking at Madame de Thoux. ''
<p/>I was sold to the South when he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was a boy,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). '' I was bought by a good and generous man.
<p/>It is but lately that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died; and I was going up to Kentucky, to see if I could find and redeem my brother.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) took me with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to the West Indies, set me free, and married me. <div class="bookquote">``I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) speak of a sister Emily, that was sold South,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George.
<p/>'' Yes, indeed!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) sustained a first rate character, both for intelligence and principle.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What sort of a girl? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Thoux/De Thoux</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Thoux, eagerly. '' A treasure,'' said George; <div class="bookquote">``a beautiful, intelligent, amiable girl.
<p/>Very pious. My mother had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up, and trained her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as carefully, almost, as a daughter. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could read and write, embroider and sew, beautifully; and was a beautiful singer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div><p/>Father bought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) once, in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) trips to New Orleans, and brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) up as a present to mother.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) born in your house?''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame de Thoux/De Thoux</b></font>)</div>said Madame de Thoux. '' No. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was about eight or nine years old, then.
<p/>Father would never tell mother what he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) gave for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); but, the other day, in looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) old papers, we came across the bill of sale.
<p/>George sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) back to Cassy, and did not see the absorbed expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) countenance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) was giving these details.
<p/>At this point in the story, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) touched his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) arm, and, with a face perfectly white with interest, said, <div class="bookquote">``Do you know the names of the people he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) bought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) of?''

<p/>At least, I think that was the name on the bill of sale. '' <div class="bookquote">``O, my God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Cassy/Misse Cassy/Misse</b></font>)</div>said Cassy, and fell insensible on the floor of the cabin.
<p/>Though neither of them could conjecture what was the cause of Cassy's fainting, still they made all the tumult which is proper in such cases;--George upsetting a wash-pitcher, and breaking two tumblers, in the warmth of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) humanity; and various ladies in the cabin, hearing that somebody had fainted, crowded the state-room door, and kept out all the air they possibly could, so that, on the whole, everything was done that could be expected.
<p/>when she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) recovered, turned her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) face to the wall, and wept and sobbed like a child,--perhaps, mother, you can tell what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was thinking of!
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt as sure, in that hour, that God had had mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) should see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) daughter,--as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did, months afterwards,--when--but we anticipate.
<p/>George was wide awake now, and so was Madame de Thoux. Poor Cassy! Perhaps you cannot,--but CHAPTER XLIII Results The rest of our story is soon told.
<p/>George Shelby, interested, as any other young man might be, by the romance of the incident, no less than by feelings of humanity, was at the pains to send to Cassy the bill of sale of Eliza; whose date and name all corresponded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own knowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mind as to the identity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) child.
<p/>Madame de Thoux and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), thus drawn together by the singular coincidence of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to Canada, and began a tour of inquiry among the stations, where the numerous fugitives from slavery are located.
<p/>At Amherstberg they found the missionary with whom George and Eliza had taken shelter, on their first arrival in Canada; and through him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) were enabled to trace the family to Montreal.
<p/>It remained now only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to trace out the path of the fugitives. George and Eliza had now been five years free.
<p/>George had found constant occupation in the shop of a worthy machinist, where he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) had been earning a competent support for his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) family, which, in the mean time, had been increased by the addition of another daughter.
<p/>The worthy pastor of the station, in Amherstberg, where George had first landed, was so much interested in the statements of Madame de Thoux and Cassy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) yielded to the solicitations of the former, to accompany them to Montreal, in their search,--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bearing all the expense of the expedition.
<p/>Little Harry--a fine bright boy--had been put to a good school, and was making rapid proficiency in knowledge. The scene now changes to a small, neat tenement, in the outskirts of Montreal; the time, evening.
<p/>In one corner of the room was a table covered with a green cloth, where was an open writing-desk, pens, paper, and over it a shelf of well-selected books.
<p/>A cheerful fire blazes on the hearth; a tea-table, covered with a snowy cloth, stands prepared for the evening meal. This was George's study.
<p/>The same zeal for self-improvement, which led him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to steal the much coveted arts of reading and writing, amid all the toil and discouragements of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) early life, still led him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) to devote all his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) leisure time to self-cultivation.
<p/>At this present time, he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is seated at the table, making notes from a volume of the family library he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) has been reading.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, George,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>says Eliza, <div class="bookquote">``you've been gone all day. Do put down that book, and let's talk, while I'm getting tea,--do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza/Eliza Harris</b></font>)</div>And little Eliza seconds the effort, by toddling up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) father, and trying to pull the book out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand, and install herself on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knee as a substitute.
<p/>'' O, you little witch!'' says George, yielding, as, in such circumstances, man always must. '' That's right,'' says Eliza, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) begins to cut a loaf of bread.
<p/>; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) form a little fuller; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) air more matronly than of yore; but evidently contented and happy as woman need be.
<p/>Harry, my boy, how did you come on in that sum, today?'' says George, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) son's head.
<p/>Harry has lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) long curls; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) can never lose those eyes and eyelashes, and that fine, bold brow, that flushes with triumph, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) answers, <div class="bookquote">``I did it, every bit of it, myself , father; and nobody helped me!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A little older she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looks '' '' That's right,'' says his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">``depend on yourself, my son. You have a better chance than ever your poor father had.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>father son</b></font>)</div>At this moment, there is a rap at the door; and Eliza goes and opens it. The delighted--<div class="bookquote">``Why! this you?'' (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>--calls up her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) husband; and the good pastor of Amherstberg is welcomed.
<p/>Now, if the truth must be told, the honest pastor had arranged a little programme, according to which this affair was to develop itself; and, on the way up, all had very cautiously and prudently exhorted each other not to let things out, except according to previous arrangement.
<p/>What was the good man's consternation, therefore, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had motioned to the ladies to be seated, and was taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth, so as to proceed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) introductory speech in good order, when Madame de Thoux upset the whole plan, by throwing her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms around George's neck, and letting all out at once, by saying, ``O, George!
<p/>There are two more women with him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), and Eliza asks them to sit down. don't you know me? I'm your sister Emily.
<p/>Cassy had seated herself more composedly, and would have carried on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) part very well, had not little Eliza suddenly appeared before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) in exact shape and form, every outline and curl, just as her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) daughter was when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) last.
<p/>The little thing peered up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) face; and Cassy caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) arms, pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) bosom, saying, what, at the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) really believed, <div class="bookquote">``Darling, I'm your mother!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>In fact, it was a troublesome matter to do up exactly in proper order; but the good pastor, at last, succeeded in getting everybody quiet, and delivering the speech with which he (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) had intended to open the exercises; and in which, at last, he (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) succeeded so well, that his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) whole audience were sobbing about him (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) in a manner that ought to satisfy any orator, ancient or modern.
<p/>there are some feelings so agitated and tumultuous, that they can find rest only by being poured into the bosom of Almighty love,--and then, rising up, the new-found family embraced each other, with a holy trust in Him (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>), who from such peril and dangers, and by such unknown ways, had brought them together.
<p/>'' They knelt together, and the good man prayed,--for The note-book of a missionary, among the Canadian fugitives, contains truth stranger than fiction.
<p/>How can it be otherwise, when a system prevails which whirls families and scatters their members, as the wind whirls and scatters the leaves of autumn?
<p/>These shores of refuge, like the eternal shore, often unite again, in glad communion, hearts that for long years have mourned each other as lost.
<p/>And affecting beyond expression is the earnestness with which every new arrival among them is met, if, perchance, it may bring tidings of mother, sister, child or wife, still lost to view in the shadows of slavery.
<p/>Deeds of heroism are wrought here more than those of romance, when defying torture, and braving death itself, the fugitive voluntarily threads his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) way back to the terrors and perils of that dark land, that he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) may bring out his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) sister, or mother, or wife.
<p/>One young man, of whom a missionary has told us, twice re-captured, and suffering shameful stripes for his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) heroism, had escaped again; and, in a letter which we heard read, tells his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) friends that he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) is going back a third time, that he (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) may, at last, bring away his (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) sister.
<p/>My good sir, is this man a hero, or a criminal? Would not you do as much for your sister? And can you blame him (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>)?
<p/>But, to return to our friends, whom we left wiping their eyes, and recovering themselves from too great and sudden a joy.
<p/>They are now seated around the social board, and are getting decidedly companionable; only that Cassy, who keeps little Eliza on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) lap, occasionally squeezes the little thing, in a manner that rather astonishes her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), and obstinately refuses to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mouth stuffed with cake to the extent the little one desires,--alleging, what the child rather wonders at, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) has got something better than cake, and doesn't want it.
<p/>And, indeed, in two or three days, such a change has passed over Cassy, that our readers would scarcely know her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) seemed to sink, at once, into the bosom of the family, and take the little ones into her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) heart, as something for which it long had waited.
<p/>Indeed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) love seemed to flow more naturally to the little Eliza than to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own daughter; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was the exact image and body of the child whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had lost.
<p/>The despairing, haggard expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) face had given way to one of gentle trust. The little one was a flowery bond between mother and daughter, through whom grew up acquaintanceship and affection.
<p/>Eliza's steady, consistent piety, regulated by the constant reading of the sacred word, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) a proper guide for the shattered and wearied mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mother.
<p/>Cassy yielded at once, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) whole soul, to every good influence, and became a devout and tender Christian. After a day or two, Madame de Thoux told her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) brother more particularly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) affairs.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) asked George what way she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) could best apply it for him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Give me an education, Emily; that has always been my heart's desire.
<p/>The death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) husband had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) an ample fortune, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) generously offered to share with the family. Then, I can do all the rest.
<p/>On mature deliberation, it was decided that the whole family should go, for some years, to France; whither they sailed, carrying Emmeline with them.
<p/>The good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the vessel; and, shortly after entering the port, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emily</b></font>) became his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) wife.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>George remained four years at a French university, and, applying himself with an unintermitted zeal, obtained a very thorough education.
<p/>Political troubles in France, at last, led the family again to seek an asylum in this country. George's feelings and views, as an educated man, may be best expressed in a letter to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends.
<p/>True, as you have said to me, I might mingle in the circles of the whites, in this country, my shade of color is so slight, and that of my wife and family scarce perceptible.
<p/>'' I feel somewhat at a loss, as to my future course. Well, perhaps, on sufferance, I might. But, to tell you the truth, I have no wish to.
<p/>'' My sympathies are not for my father's race, but for my mother's. To him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I was no more than a fine dog or horse: to my poor heart-broken mother
<p/>I was a child ; and, though I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), after the cruel sale that separated us, till she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) died, yet
<p/>When I think of all she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) suffered, of my own early sufferings, of the distresses and struggles of my heroic wife, of my sister, sold in the New Orleans slave-market,--though
<p/>I hope to have no unchristian sentiments, yet I may be excused for saying, I have no wish to pass for an American, or to identify myself with them.
<p/>It is with the oppressed, enslaved African race that I cast in my lot; and, if I wished anything, I would wish myself two shades darker, rather than one lighter.
<p/>I know she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) always loved me dearly. I know it by my own heart. '' '' The desire and yearning of my soul is for an African nationality .
<p/>I want a people that shall have a tangible, separate existence of its own; and where am I to look for it?
<p/>The race that formed the character of the Haytiens was a worn-out, effeminate one; and, of course, the subject race will be centuries in rising to anything.
<p/>Not in Hayti; for in Hayti they had nothing to start with. A stream cannot rise above its fountain. '' Where, then, shall I look?
<p/>On the shores of Africa I see a republic,--a republic formed of picked men, who, by energy and self-educating force, have, in many cases, individually, raised themselves above a condition of slavery.
<p/>Having gone through a preparatory stage of feebleness, this republic has, at last, become an acknowledged nation on the face of the earth,--acknowledged by both France and England.
<p/>There it is my wish to go, and find myself a people. '' I am aware, now, that I shall have you all against me; but, before you strike, hear me.
<p/>I have noted the struggle between abolitionist and colonizationist, and have received some impressions, as a distant spectator, which could never have occurred to me as a participator.
<p/>I grant that this Liberia may have subserved all sorts of purposes, by being played off, in the hands of our oppressors, against us.
<p/>During my stay in France, I have followed up, with intense interest, the history of my people in America. '' Doubtless the scheme may have been used, in unjustifiable ways, as a means of retarding our emancipation.
<p/>But the question to me is, Is there not a God above all man's schemes? May He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) not have over-ruled their designs, and founded for us a nation by them? ''
<p/>A nation starts, now, with all the great problems of republican life and civilization wrought out to its hand;--it has not to discover, but only to apply.
<p/>Let us, then, all take hold together, with all our might, and see what we can do with this new enterprise, and the whole splendid continent of Africa opens before us and our children.
<p/>Our nation shall roll the tide of civilization and Christianity along its shores, and plant there mighty republics, that, growing with the rapidity of tropical vegetation, shall be for all coming ages.
<p/>In these days, a nation is born in a day. '' Do you say that I am deserting my enslaved brethren?
<p/>I think not. If I forget them one hour, one moment of my life, so may God forget me! But, what can I do for them, here?
<p/>No, not as an individual; but, let me go and form part of a nation, which shall have a voice in the councils of nations, and then we can speak.
<p/>Can I break their chains? A nation has a right to argue, remonstrate, implore, and present the cause of its race,--which
<p/>an individual has not. '' If Europe ever becomes a grand council of free nations,--as I trust in God it will,--if
<p/>, there, serfdom, and all unjust and oppressive social inequalities, are done away; and if they, as France and England have done, acknowledge our position,--then, in the great congress of nations, we will make our appeal, and present the cause of our enslaved and suffering race; and it cannot be that free, enlightened America will not then desire to wipe from her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) escutcheon that bar sinister which disgraces her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) among nations, and is as truly a curse to her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) as to the enslaved.
<p/>But, you will tell me, our race have equal rights to mingle in the American republic as the Irishman, the German, the Swede.
<p/>We ought to be free to meet and mingle,--to rise by our individual worth, without any consideration of caste or color; and they who deny us this right are false to their own professed principles of human equality.
<p/>'' Granted, they have. We ought, in particular, to be allowed here . We have more than the rights of common men;--we have the claim of an injured race for reparation.
<p/>I think that the African race has peculiarities, yet to be unfolded in the light of civilization and Christianity, which, if not the same with those of the Anglo-Saxon, may prove to be, morally, of even a higher type.
<p/>But, then, I do not want it ; I want a country, a nation, of my own. '' To the Anglo-Saxon race has been intrusted the destinies of the world, during its pioneer period of struggle and conflict.
<p/>To that mission its stern, inflexible, energetic elements, were well adapted; but, as a Christian, I look for another era to arise.
<p/>On its borders I trust we stand; and the throes that now convulse the nations are, to my hope, but the birth-pangs of an hour of universal peace and brotherhood.
<p/>'' I trust that the development of Africa is to be essentially a Christian one. If not a dominant and commanding race, they are, at least, an affectionate, magnanimous, and forgiving one.
<p/>Having been called in the furnace of injustice and oppression, they have need to bind closer to their hearts that sublime doctrine of love and forgiveness, through which alone they are to conquer, which it is to be their mission to spread over the continent of Africa.
<p/>In myself, I confess, I am feeble for this,--full half the blood in my veins is the hot and hasty Saxon; but I have an eloquent preacher of the Gospel ever by my side, in the person of my beautiful wife.
<p/>When I wander, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) gentler spirit ever restores me, and keeps before my eyes the Christian calling and mission of our race.
<p/>As a Christian patriot, as a teacher of Christianity, I go to my country ,--my chosen, my glorious Africa!--and to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), in my heart, I sometimes apply those splendid words of prophecy: `Whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated, so that no man went through thee; I will make thee an eternal excellence, a joy of many generations!'
<p/>'' '' You will call me an enthusiast: you will tell me that I have not well considered what I am undertaking.
<p/>But I have considered, and counted the cost. I go to Liberia , not as an Elysium of romance, but as to a field of work .
<p/>I expect to work with both hands,--to work hard ; to work against all sorts of difficulties and discouragements; and to work till I die.
<p/>Whatever you may think of my determination, do not divorce me from your confidence; and think that, in whatever I do, I act with a heart wholly given to my people.
<p/>This is what I go for; and in this I am quite sure I shall not be disappointed. '' <div class="bookquote">``GEORGE HARRIS.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>George, with his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for Africa, some few weeks after. If we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) there.
<p/>Of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except a word relating to Miss Ophelia and Topsy, and a farewell chapter, which we shall dedicate to George Shelby.
<p/>Miss Ophelia took Topsy home to Vermont with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), much to the surprise of the grave deliberative body whom a New Englander recognizes under the term '' Our folks .
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Our folks,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ophelia/Ophelia</b></font>)</div>at first, thought it an odd and unnecessary addition to their well-trained domestic establishment; but, so thoroughly efficient was Miss Ophelia in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) conscientious endeavor to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) duty by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) élève , that the child rapidly grew in grace and in favor with the family and neighborhood.
<p/>At the age of womanhood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own request, baptized, and became a member of the Christian church in the place; and showed so much intelligence, activity and zeal, and desire to do good in the world, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was at last recommended, and approved as a missionary to one of the stations in Africa; and we have heard that the same activity and ingenuity which, when a child, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) so multiform and restless in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) developments, is now employed, in a safer and wholesomer manner, in teaching the children of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) own country.
<p/>P.S.--It will be a satisfaction to some mother, also, to state, that some inquiries, which were set on foot by Madame de Thoux, have resulted recently in the discovery of Cassy's son.
<p/>Being a young man of energy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had escaped, some years before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, and been received and educated by friends of the oppressed in the north.
<p/>The Liberator George Shelby had written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) mother merely a line, stating the day that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) will soon follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) family to Africa. CHAPTER XLIV Of the death scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) old friend he (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) had not the heart to write.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) had tried several times, and only succeeded in half choking himself; and invariably finished by tearing up the paper, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) eyes, and rushing somewhere to get quiet.
<p/>There was a pleased bustle all though the Shelby mansion, that day, in expectation of the arrival of young Mas'r George.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby was seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) comfortable parlor, where a cheerful hickory fire was dispelling the chill of the late autumn evening.
<p/>A supper-table, glittering with plate and cut glass, was set out, on whose arrangements our former friend, old Chloe, was presiding.
<p/>Arrayed in a new calico dress, with clean, white apron, and high, well-starched turban, her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) black polished face glowing with satisfaction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) lingered, with needless punctiliousness, around the arrangements of the table, merely as an excuse for talking a little to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) mistress.
<p/>'' Laws, now! won't it look natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>)? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) said. '' Thar,--I set his (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) plate just whar he (<font color='blue'><b>calico</b></font>) likes it round by the fire.
<p/>Mas'r George allers wants de warm seat. O, go way!--why didn't Sally get out de best tea-pot,--de little new one, Mas'r
<p/>George got for Missis, Christmas? I'll have it out! And Missis has heard from Mas'r George? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) said, inquiringly. ''
<p/>Yes, Chloe; but only a line, just to say he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) would be home tonight, if he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could,--that's all. '' <div class="bookquote">``Didn't say nothin' `bout my old man, s`pose?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) had felt uneasy, ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) received her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) son's letter, lest something should prove to be hidden behind the veil of silence which he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had drawn.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby sighed, and felt a heavy weight on her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) heart, at this allusion. '' Missis has got dem bills?'' said Chloe, anxiously.
<p/>'' Yes, Chloe. '' '' 'Cause I wants to show my old man dem very bills de perfectioner gave me. '
<p/>`Thank you, Mas`r,' says I, 'I would, only my old man's coming home, and Missis,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) can't do without me no longer.'
<p/>And,' say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), `Chloe, I wish you'd stay longer.' There's jist what I telled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Berry nice man, dat Mas'r Jones was.
<p/>Chloe had pertinaciously insisted that the very bills in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) wages had been paid should be preserved, to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) husband, in memorial of her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) capability.
<p/>'' And Mrs. Shelby had readily consented to humor her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) in the request. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) won't know Polly,--my old man won't.
<p/>Laws, it's five year since they tuck him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) was a baby den,--couldn't but jist stand. Remember how tickled he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used to be, cause she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) would keep a fallin' over, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) sot out to walk.
<p/>Laws a me!'' The rattling of wheels now was heard. '' Mas'r George! '' said Aunt Chloe, starting to the window.
<p/>Mrs. Shelby ran to the entry door, and was folded in the arms of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) son. Aunt Chloe stood anxiously straining her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) eyes out into the darkness.
<p/>'' said George, stopping compassionately, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) hard, black hand between both his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I'd have given all my fortune to have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) with me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>)'s gone to a better country.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>O, poor Aunt Chloe! '' There was a passionate exclamation from Mrs. Shelby, but Aunt Chloe said nothing. The party entered the supper-room.
<p/>Thar,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>), gathering it up, and holding it, with a trembling hand, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) mistress, <div class="bookquote">``don't never want to see nor hear on 't again.
<p/>The money, of which Chloe was so proud, was still lying on the table. ''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>Jist as I knew 't would be,--sold, and murdered on dem ar' old plantations!
<p/>Mrs. Shelby followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) softly, and took one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) hands, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) down into a chair, and sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>).
<p/>'' Chloe turned, and was walking proudly out of the room. '' My poor, good Chloe!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>). Chloe leaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Chloe</b></font>) mistress' shoulder, and sobbed out, <div class="bookquote">``O Missis! '
<p/>scuse me, my heart's broke,--dat's all!''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress shoulder</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I know it is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Shelby, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) tears fell fast; <div class="bookquote">``and I cannot heal it, but Jesus can.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) healeth the broken hearted, and bindeth up their wounds. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Shelby</b></font>)</div>There was a silence for some time, and all wept together.
<p/>At last, George, sitting down beside the mourner, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) hand, and, with simple pathos, repeated the triumphant scene of her (<font color='blue'><b>Shelby</b></font>) husband's death, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last messages of love.
<p/>About a month after this, one morning, all the servants of the Shelby estate were convened together in the great hall that ran through the house, to hear a few words from their young master.
<p/>To the surprise of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) appeared among them with a bundle of papers in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hand, containing a certificate of freedom to every one on the place, which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) read successively, and presented, amid the sobs and tears and shouts of all present.
<p/>Many, however, pressed around him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), earnestly begging him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) not to send them away; and, with anxious faces, tendering back their free papers.
<p/>'' We don't want to be no freer than we are. We's allers had all we wanted. We don't want to leave de ole place, and Mas'r and Missis, and de rest!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``My good friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) could get a silence, ``there'll be no need for you to leave me.
<p/>The place wants as many hands to work it as it did before. We need the same about the house that we did before.
<p/>But, you are now free men and free women. I shall pay you wages for your work, such as we shall agree on.
<p/>The advantage is, that in case of my getting in debt, or dying,--things that might happen,--you cannot now be taken up and sold.
<p/>I expect to carry on the estate, and to teach you what, perhaps, it will take you some time to learn,--how to use the rights I give you as free men and women.
<p/>I expect you to be good, and willing to learn; and I trust in God that I shall be faithful, and willing to teach.
<p/>An aged, partriarchal negro, who had grown gray and blind on the estate, now rose, and, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) trembling hand said, <div class="bookquote">``Let us give thanks unto the Lord!''
 (<font color='red'><b>An negro</b></font>)</div><p/>As all kneeled by one consent, a more touching and hearty Te Deum never ascended to heaven, though borne on the peal of organ, bell and cannon, than came from that honest old heart.
<p/>On rising, another struck up a Methodist hymn, of which the burden was, <div class="bookquote">``The year of Jubilee is come,-- Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.
<p/>One thing more,''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>said George, as he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) stopped the congratulations of the throng; ``you all remember our good old Uncle Tom?
<p/>George here gave a short narration of the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) death, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) loving farewell to all on the place, and added, <div class="bookquote">``It was on his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) grave, my friends, that I resolved, before God, that I would never own another slave, while it was possible to free him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); that nobody, through me, should ever run the risk of being parted from home and friends, and dying on a lonely plantation, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) died.
<p/>So, when you rejoice in your freedom, think that you owe it to that good old soul, and pay it back in kindness to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife and children.
<p/>Think of your freedom, every time you see UNCLE TOM'S CABIN; and let it be a memorial to put you all in mind to follow in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) steps, and be honest and faithful and Christian as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was.
<p/>And now, my friends, look up, and thank God for the blessing of freedom. ''  (<font color='red'><b>George/George Harris/Harris</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' '' CHAPTER XLV Concluding Remarks
<p/>The writer has often been inquired of, by correspondents from different parts of the country, whether this narrative is a true one; and to these inquiries she (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) will give one general answer.
<p/>The separate incidents that compose the narrative are, to a very great extent, authentic, occurring, many of them, either under her (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) own observation, or that of her (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) personal friends.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) friends have observed characters the counterpart of almost all that are here introduced; and many of the sayings are word for word as heard herself, or reported to her (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>).
<p/>The personal appearance of Eliza, the character ascribed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), are sketches drawn from life. The incorruptible fidelity, piety and honesty, of Uncle Tom, had more than one development, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) personal knowledge.
<p/>Some of the most deeply tragic and romantic, some of the most terrible incidents, have also their parallels in reality. The incident of the mother's crossing the Ohio river on the ice is a well-known fact.
<p/>The story of <div class="bookquote">``old Prue,''  (<font color='red'><b>a brother</b></font>)</div>in the second volume, was an incident that fell under the personal observation of a brother of the writer, then collecting-clerk to a large mercantile house, in New Orleans.
<p/>Of him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Prue</b></font>) brother thus wrote, speaking of visiting his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) plantation, on a collecting tour; <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) actually made me feel of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) fist, which was like a blacksmith's hammer, or a nodule of iron, telling me that it was `calloused with knocking down niggers.'
<p/>When I left the plantation, I drew a long breath, and felt as if I had escaped from an ogre's den.
<p/>That the tragical fate of Tom, also, has too many times had its parallel, there are living witnesses, all over our land, to testify.
<p/>Let it be remembered that in all southern states it is a principle of jurisprudence that no person of colored lineage can testify in a suit against a white, and it will be easy to see that such a case may occur, wherever there is a man whose passions outweigh his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interests, and a slave who has manhood or principle enough to resist his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will.
<p/>From the same source was derived the character of the planter Legree. ''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>There is, actually, nothing to protect the slave's life, but the character of the master.
<p/>Facts too shocking to be contemplated occasionally force their way to the public ear, and the comment that one often hears made on them is more shocking than the thing itself.
<p/>It is said, <div class="bookquote">``Very likely such cases may now and then occur, but they are no sample of general practice. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>a master</b></font>)</div><p/>If the laws of New England were so arranged that a master could now and then torture an apprentice to death, would it be received with equal composure?
<p/>Would it be said, <div class="bookquote">``These cases are rare, and no samples of general practice'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>? This injustice is an inherent one in the slave system,--it cannot exist without it.
<p/>The public and shameless sale of beautiful mulatto and quadroon girls has acquired a notoriety, from the incidents following the capture of the Pearl.
<p/>We extract the following from the speech of Hon. Horace Mann, one of the legal counsel for the defendants in that case.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mann</b></font>) says: <div class="bookquote">``In that company of seventy-six persons, who attempted, in 1848, to escape from the District of Columbia in the schooner Pearl, and whose officers I assisted in defending, there were several young and healthy girls, who had those peculiar attractions of form and feature which connoisseurs prize so highly.
<p/>Elizabeth Russel was one of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) immediately fell into the slave-trader's fangs, and was doomed for the New Orleans market.
<p/>They offered eighteen hundred dollars to redeem her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and some there were who offered to give, that would not have much left after the gift; but the fiend of a slave-trader was inexorable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was despatched to New Orleans; but, when about half way there, God had mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and smote her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with death.
<p/>The hearts of those that saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) were touched with pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) fate. There were two girls named Edmundson in the same company.
<p/>When about to be sent to the same market, an older sister went to the shambles, to plead with the wretch who owned them, for the love of God, to spare his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) victims.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bantered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), telling what fine dresses and fine furniture they would have. ' Yes,' she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said, `that may do very well in this life, but what will become of them in the next?'
<p/>They too were sent to New Orleans; but were afterwards redeemed, at an enormous ransom, and brought back. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Is it not plain, from this, that the histories of Emmeline and Cassy may have many counterparts?
<p/>Justice, too, obliges the author to state that the fairness of mind and generosity attributed to St. Clare are not without a parallel, as the following anecdote will show.
<p/>A few years since, a young southern gentleman was in Cincinnati, with a favorite servant, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) personal attendant from a boy.
<p/>The young man took advantage of this opportunity to secure his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own freedom, and fled to the protection of a Quaker, who was quite noted in affairs of this kind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had always treated the slave with such indulgence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection was such, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have been practised upon to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to revolt from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visited the Quaker, in high anger; but, being possessed of uncommon candor and fairness, was soon quieted by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arguments and representations.
<p/>It was a side of the subject which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never had heard,--never had thought on; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately told the Quaker that, if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slave would, to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own face, say that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desire to be free, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would liberate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>An interview was forthwith procured, and Nathan was asked by his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) young master whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) had ever had any reason to complain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) treatment, in any respect.
<p/>The owner was exceedingly indignant. '' No, Mas`r,'' said Nathan; <div class="bookquote">``you've always been good to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Nathan</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, why do you want to leave me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mas'r may die, and then who get me?--I'd rather be a free man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>After some deliberation, the young master replied, <div class="bookquote">``Nathan, in your place, I think I should feel very much so, myself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) immediately made him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) out free papers; deposited a sum of money in the hands of the Quaker, to be judiciously used in assisting him (<font color='blue'><b>Nathan</b></font>) to start in life, and left a very sensible and kind letter of advice to the young man.
<p/>The author hopes she (<font color='blue'><b>Quaker</b></font>) has done justice to that nobility, generosity, and humanity, which in many cases characterize individuals at the South.
<p/>You are free. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>That letter was for some time in the writer's hands. Such instances save us from utter despair of our kind.
<p/>For many years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Quaker</b></font>) life, the author avoided all reading upon or allusion to the subject of slavery, considering it as too painful to be inquired into, and one which advancing light and civilization would certainly live down.
<p/>But, since the legislative act of 1850, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Quaker</b></font>) heard, with perfect surprise and consternation, Christian and humane people actually recommending the remanding escaped fugitives into slavery, as a duty binding on good
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Quaker</b></font>) heard, on all hands, from kind, compassionate and estimable people, in the free states of the North, deliberations and discussions as to what Christian duty could be on this
<p/>head,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Quaker</b></font>) could only think, These men and Christians cannot know what slavery is; if they did, such a question could never be open for discussion.
<p/>But, she (<font color='blue'><b>Quaker</b></font>) asks any person, who knows the world, are such characters common , anywhere? citizens,--when And from this arose a desire to exhibit it in a living dramatic reality .
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Quaker</b></font>) has endeavored to show it fairly, in its best and its worst phases. In its best aspect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Quaker</b></font>) has, perhaps, been successful; but,
<p/>oh! who shall say what yet remains untold in that valley and shadow of death , that lies the other side?
<p/>To you, generous, noble-minded men and women, of the South,--you, whose virtue, and magnanimity and purity of character, are the greater for the severer trial it has
<p/>Have you not, in your own secret souls, in your own private conversings, felt that there are woes and evils, in this accursed system, far beyond what are here shadowed, or can be shadowed?
<p/>encountered,--to you is her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) appeal. Can it be otherwise? Is man ever a creature to be trusted with wholly irresponsible power?
<p/>And does not the slave system, by denying the slave all legal right of testimony, make every individual owner an irresponsible despot?
<p/>If there is, as we admit, a public sentiment among you, men of honor, justice and humanity, is there not also another kind of public sentiment among the ruffian, the brutal and debased?
<p/>And cannot the ruffian, the brutal, the debased, by slave law, own just as many slaves as the best and purest?
<p/>Can anybody fail to make the inference what the practical result will be? Are the honorable, the just, the high-minded and compassionate, the majority anywhere in this world?
<p/>But a slave-trade, as systematic as ever was carried on on the coast of Africa, is an inevitable attendant and result of American slavery.
<p/>The writer has given only a faint shadow, a dim picture, of the anguish and despair that are, at this very moment, riving thousands of hearts, shattering thousands of families, and driving a helpless and sensitive race to frenzy and despair.
<p/>There are those living who know the mothers whom this accursed traffic has driven to the murder of their children; and themselves seeking in death a shelter from woes more dreaded than death.
<p/>Nothing of tragedy can be written, can be spoken, can be conceived, that equals the frightful reality of scenes daily and hourly acting on our shores, beneath the shadow of American law, and the shadow of the cross of Christ.
<p/>And now, men and women of America, is this a thing to be trifled with, apologized for, and passed over in silence?
<p/>Farmers of Massachusetts, of New Hampshire, of Vermont, of Connecticut, who read this book by the blaze of your winter-evening fire,--strong-hearted, generous sailors and ship-owners of Maine,--is this a thing for you to countenance and encourage?
<p/>Brave and generous men of New York, farmers of rich and joyous Ohio, and ye of the wide prairie states,--answer, is this a thing for you to protect and countenance?
<p/>And you, mothers of America,--you who have learned, by the cradles of your own children, to love and feel for all mankind,--by the sacred love you bear your child; by your joy in his (<font color='blue'><b>sailors</b></font>) beautiful, spotless infancy; by the motherly pity and tenderness with which you guide his (<font color='blue'><b>sailors</b></font>) growing years; by the anxieties of his (<font color='blue'><b>sailors</b></font>) education; by the prayers you breathe for his (<font color='blue'><b>sailors</b></font>) soul's eternal good;--I beseech you, pity the mother who has all your affections, and not one legal right to protect, guide, or educate, the child of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) bosom!
<p/>By the sick hour of your child; by those dying eyes, which you can never forget; by those last cries, that wrung your heart when you could neither help nor save; by the desolation of that empty cradle, that silent nursery,--I beseech you, pity those mothers that are constantly made childless by the American slave-trade!
<p/>The slave-trade is now, by American law, considered as piracy. And its heart-break and its horrors, can they be told? And say, mothers of America, is this a thing to be defended, sympathized with, passed over in silence?
<p/>Do you say that the people of the free state have nothing to do with it, and can do nothing? Would to God this were true!
<p/>The people of the free states have defended, encouraged, and participated; and are more guilty for it, before God, than the South, in that they have not the apology of education or custom.
<p/>If the mothers of the free states had all felt as they should, in times past, the sons of the free states would not have been the holders, and, proverbially, the hardest masters of slaves; the sons of the free states would not have connived at the extension of slavery, in our national body; the sons of the free states would not, as they do, trade the souls and bodies of men as an equivalent to money, in their mercantile dealings.
<p/>There are multitudes of slaves temporarily owned, and sold again, by merchants in northern cities; and shall the whole guilt or obloquy of slavery fall only on the South?
<p/>Northern men, northern mothers, northern Christians, have something more to do than denounce their brethren at the South; they have to look to the evil among themselves.
<p/>But it is not true. But, what can any individual do? Of that, every individual can judge. There is one thing that every individual can do,--they can see to it that they feel right .
<p/>An atmosphere of sympathetic influence encircles every human being; and the man or woman who feels strongly, healthily and justly, on the great interests of humanity, is a constant benefactor to the human race.
<p/>See, then, to your sympathies in this matter! Are they in harmony with the sympathies of Christ? or are they swayed and perverted by the sophistries of worldly policy?
<p/>Christian men and women of the North! still further,--you have another power; you can pray! Do you believe in prayer? or has it become an indistinct apostolic tradition?
<p/>And pray for those distressed Christians whose whole chance of religious improvement is an accident of trade and sale; from whom any adherence to the morals of Christianity is, in many cases, an impossibility, unless they have given them, from above, the courage and grace of martyrdom.
<p/>On the shores of our free states are emerging the poor, shattered, broken remnants of families,--men and women, escaped, by miraculous providences from the surges of slavery,--feeble in knowledge, and, in many cases, infirm in moral constitution, from a system which confounds and confuses every principle of Christianity and morality.
<p/>You pray for the heathen abroad; pray also for the heathen at home. But, still more. They come to seek a refuge among you; they come to seek education, knowledge, Christianity.
<p/>Does not every American Christian owe to the African race some effort at reparation for the wrongs that the American nation has brought upon them?
<p/>What do you owe to these poor unfortunates, oh Christians? Shall the doors of churches and school-houses be shut upon them?
<p/>Shall the church of Christ hear in silence the taunt that is thrown at them, and shrink away from the helpless hand that they stretch out; and, by her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) silence, encourage the cruelty that would chase them from our borders?
<p/>If it must be so, the country will have reason to tremble, when it remembers that the fate of nations is in the hands of One who is very pitiful, and of tender compassion.
<p/>Shall states arise and shake them out? If it must be so, it will be a mournful spectacle. Do you say, <div class="bookquote">``We don't want them here; let them go to Africa'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>?
<p/>That the providence of God has provided a refuge in Africa, is, indeed, a great and noticeable fact; but that is no reason why the church of Christ should throw off that responsibility to this outcast race which her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) profession demands of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>To fill up Liberia with an ignorant, inexperienced, half-barbarized race, just escaped from the chains of slavery, would be only to prolong, for ages, the period of struggle and conflict which attends the inception of new enterprises.
<p/>Let the church of the north receive these poor sufferers in the spirit of Christ; receive them to the educating advantages of Christian republican society and schools, until they have attained to somewhat of a moral and intellectual maturity, and then assist them in their passage to those shores, where they may put in practice the lessons they have learned in America.
<p/>There is a body of men at the north, comparatively small, who have been doing this; and, as the result, this country has already seen examples of men, formerly slaves, who have rapidly acquired property, reputation, and education.
<p/>Talent has been developed, which, considering the circumstances, is certainly remarkable; and, for moral traits of honesty, kindness, tenderness of feeling,--for heroic efforts and self-denials, endured for the ransom of brethren and friends yet in slavery,--they have been remarkable to a degree that, considering the influence under which they were born, is surprising.
<p/>The writer has lived, for many years, on the frontier-line of slave states, and has had great opportunities of observation among those who formerly were slaves.
<p/>They have been in her (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) family as servants; and, in default of any other school to receive them, she (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) has, in many cases, had them instructed in a family school, with her (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) own children.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) has also the testimony of missionaries, among the fugitives in Canada, in coincidence with her (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) own experience; and her (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) deductions, with regard to the capabilities of the race, are encouraging in the highest degree.
<p/>There is nothing that they are not willing to give or do to have their children instructed, and, so far as the writer has observed herself, or taken the testimony of teachers among them, they are remarkably intelligent and quick to learn.
<p/>The first desire of the emancipated slave, generally, is for education . The results of schools, founded for them by benevolent individuals in Cincinnati, fully establish this.
<p/>The author gives the following statement of facts, on the authority of Professor C. E. Stowe, then of Lane Seminary, Ohio, with regard to emancipated slaves, now resident in Cincinnati; given to show the capability of the race, even without any very particular assistance or encouragement.
<p/>The initial letters alone are given. They are all residents of Cincinnati. '' B--. Furniture maker; twenty years in the city; worth ten thousand dollars, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Professor</b></font>) own earnings; a Baptist.
<p/>``C--. Full black; stolen from Africa; sold in New Orleans; been free fifteen years; paid for himself six hundred dollars; a farmer; owns several farms in Indiana; Presbyterian; probably worth fifteen or twenty thousand dollars, all earned by himself.
<p/>Full black; dealer in real estate; worth thirty thousand dollars; about forty years old; free six years; paid eighteen hundred dollars for his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) family; member of the Baptist church; received a legacy from his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) master, which he (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) has taken good care of, and increased.
<p/>Full black; coal dealer; about thirty years old; worth eighteen thousand dollars; paid for himself twice, being once defrauded to the amount of sixteen hundred dollars; made all his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) money by his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) own efforts--much of it while a slave, hiring his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) time of his (<font color='blue'><b>dealer</b></font>) master, and doing business for himself; a fine, gentlemanly fellow.
<p/>Three-fourths black; barber and waiter; from Kentucky; nineteen years free; paid for self and family over three thousand dollars; deacon in the Baptist church.
<p/>Three-fourths black; white-washer; from Kentucky; nine years free; paid fifteen hundred dollars for self and family; recently died, aged sixty; worth six thousand dollars.
<p/>Professor Stowe says, ``With all these, except G--, I have been, for some years, personally acquainted, and make my statements from my own knowledge.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``K--. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>G--. '' W--. '' G. D--. '' '' The writer well remembers an aged colored woman, who was employed as a washerwoman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father's family.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a remarkably active and capable young woman, and, by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) industry and thrift, and the most persevering self-denial, raised nine hundred dollars for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband's freedom, which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) paid, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised it, into the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) master.
<p/>The daughter of this woman married a slave. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) yet wanted a hundred dollars of the price, when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) died. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) never recovered any of the money.
<p/>These are but few facts, among multitudes which might be adduced, to show the self-denial, energy, patience, and honesty, which the slave has exhibited in a state of freedom.
<p/>And let it be remembered that these individuals have thus bravely succeeded in conquering for themselves comparative wealth and social position, in the face of every disadvantage and discouragement.
<p/>The colored man, by the law of Ohio, cannot be a voter, and, till within a few years, was even denied the right of testimony in legal suits with the white.
<p/>In all states of the Union we see men, but yesterday burst from the shackles of slavery, who, by a self-educating force, which cannot be too much admired, have risen to highly respectable stations in society.
<p/>Nor are these instances confined to the State of Ohio. Pennington, among clergymen, Douglas and Ward, among editors, are well known instances.
<p/>If this persecuted race, with every discouragement and disadvantage, have done thus much, how much more they might do if the Christian church would act towards them in the spirit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ward</b></font>) Lord!
<p/>This is an age of the world when nations are trembling and convulsed. A mighty influence is abroad, surging and heaving the world, as with an earthquake.
<p/>And is America safe? Every nation that carries in its bosom great and unredressed injustice has in it the elements of this last convulsion.
<p/>For what is this mighty influence thus rousing in all nations and languages those groanings that cannot be uttered, for man's freedom and equality?
<p/>Is not this power the spirit of Him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whose kingdom is yet to come, and whose will to be done on earth as it is in heaven?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``for that day shall burn as an oven: and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shall appear as a swift witness against those that oppress the hireling in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wages, the widow and the fatherless, and that turn aside the stranger in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) right : and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) shall break in pieces the oppressor.
<p/>O, Church of Christ, read the signs of the times! But who may abide the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) appearing? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Are not these dread words for a nation bearing in her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) bosom so mighty an injustice?
<p/>every time that you pray that the kingdom of Christ may come, can you forget that prophecy associates, in dread fellowship, the day of vengeance with the year of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) redeemed?
<p/>Christians! A day of grace is yet held out to us. Both North and South have been guilty before God; and the Christian church has a heavy account to answer.
<p/>Not by combining together, to protect injustice and cruelty, and making a common capital of sin, is this Union to be saved,--but by repentance, justice and mercy; for, not surer is the eternal law by which the millstone sinks in the ocean, than that stronger law, by which injustice and cruelty shall bring on nations the wrath of Almighty God!
