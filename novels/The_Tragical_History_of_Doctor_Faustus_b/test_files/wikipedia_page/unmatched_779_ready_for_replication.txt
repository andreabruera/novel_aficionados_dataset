the tragical #history# of the life and death of doctor $john_faustus$ commonly referred to simply as doctor $john_faustus$ is an elizabethan tragedy by christopher marlowe based on german stories about the title character faust
the spelling histoy is agreed to be typographical error original languageearly modern englishgenretragedysetting century europe it was written sometime between and and might have been performed between and marlowe death in
two different versions of the play were published in the jacobean era several #year# later the powerful effect of early productions of the play is indicated by the legends that quickly accrued around them
that actual #devil# once appeared on the stage during performance to the great amazement of both the actors and spectators sight that was said to have driven some spectators mad
on november the diary of philip henslowe recorded payment to samuel rowley and william bird for additions to the play which suggests revival soon after that date
the admiral #man# performed doctor $john_faustus$ #time# in the three #year# between october and october the powerful effect of the early productions is indicated by the legends that quickly accrued around them
in histriomastix his polemic against the drama william prynne records the tale that actual #devil# once appeared on the stage during performance of $john_faustus$ to the great amazement of both the actors and spectators
john aubrey recorded related legend that edward alleyn lead actor of the admiral #man# devoted his later #year# to charitable endeavours like the founding of dulwich college in direct response to this incident
the play may have been entered into the stationers register on december though the records are confused and appear to indicate conflict over the rights to the play
a subsequent stationers register entry dated january assigns the play to the bookseller thomas bushnell the publisher of the first edition
some people were allegedly driven mad distracted with that fearful sight bushnell transferred his rights to the play to john wright on september
two versions of the play exist the quarto printed by valentine simmes for thomas law this is usually called the text
the title page attributes the play to ch a second edition a of first version was printed by george eld for john wright in
it is merely direct reprint of the text the text is short for an english renaissance play only #line# long the quarto published by john wright the enlarged and altered text usually called the text
additions and alterations were made by the minor playwright and actor samuel rowley and by william borne or birde and possibly by marlowe himself
the version was once believed to be closer to the play as originally performed in marlowe lifetime simply because it was older
by the after influential studies by leo kirschbaum the version came to be regarded as an abbreviation and the version as marlowe original fuller version
this second text was reprinted in and as late as kirschbaum and greg considered the a text bad quarto and thought that the text was linked to marlowe himself
since then scholarship has swung the other way most scholars now considering the a text more authoritative even if abbreviated and corrupt according to charles nicholl
among the #line# shared by both versions there are some small but significant changes in wording for example never too late if $john_faustus$ can repent in the text becomes never too late if $john_faustus$ will repent in the text change that offers very different possibility for $john_faustus$ hope and repentance
the version omits #line# but adds new #line# making it roughly one third longer than the version another difference between texts and is the #name# of the #devil# summoned by $john_faustus$
the #name# of the #devil# is in each case reference to mephistopheles in faustbuch the source work which appeared in english translation in about
text states the #name# is generally mephistopheles while the version of text commonly states mephostophilis the relationship between the texts is uncertain and many modern editions print both
as an elizabethan playwright marlowe had nothing to do with the publication and had no control over the play in performance so it was possible for scenes to be dropped or shortened or for new scenes to be added so that the resulting publications may be modified versions of the original script
however most scholars today consider the comic interludes an integral part of the play regardless of their author and so they continue to be included in print
in the past it was assumed that the comic scenes were additions by other writers their tone shows the change in $john_faustus$ ambitions suggesting marlowe did at least oversee the composition of them
the clown is seen as the archetype for comic relief doctor $john_faustus$ is based on an older tale it is believed to be the first dramatization of the faust legend
believe that marlowe developed the story from popular translation commonly called the english faust #book# german edition of the historia von johann fausten which itself may have been influenced by
even earlier equally ill preserved pamphlets in latin such as those that likely inspired jacob bidermann treatment of the damnation of the doctor of paris cenodoxus
several soothsayers or necromancers of the late fifteenth century adopted the #name# $john_faustus$ reference to the latin for favored or auspicious typical was georgius $john_faustus$ helmstetensis calling himself astrologer and chiromancer who was expelled from the town of ingolstadt for such practices
whatever the inspiration the development of marlowe play is very faithful to the faust #book# especially in the way it mixes comedy with tragedy
subsequent commentators have identified this individual as the prototypical $john_faustus$ of the legend however marlowe also introduced some changes to make it more original
the substitution of pageant of #devil# for the seven deadly sins he also emphasised $john_faustus$ intellectual aspirations and curiosity and minimised the vices in the character to lend renaissance aura to the story
$john_faustus$ soliloquy in act on the vanity of human science the play is in blank verse and prose in thirteen scenes or twenty scenes
blank verse is largely reserved for the main scenes while prose is used in the comic scenes modern texts divide the play into five acts act being the shortest
as in many elizabethan plays there is chorus which functions as narrator that does not interact with the other characters but rather provides an introduction and conclusion to the play and at the beginning of some acts introduces events that have unfolded
leonard frey wrote document entitled in the opening and close of doctor $john_faustus$ which mainly focuses on $john_faustus$ opening and closing soliloquies
he stresses the importance of the soliloquies in the play saying the soliloquy perhaps more than any other dramatic device involved the audience in an imaginative concern with the happenings on stage
by having doctor $john_faustus$ deliver these soliloquies at the beginning and #end# of the play the focus is drawn to his inner thoughts and feelings about succumbing to the #devil#
along with its #history# and language style scholars have critiqued and analysed the structure of the play the soliloquies also have parallel concepts
in the introductory soliloquy $john_faustus$ begins by pondering the fate of his life and what he wants his career to be
he ends his soliloquy with the solution and decision to give his #soul# to the #devil# similarly in the closing soliloquy $john_faustus$ begins pondering and finally comes to terms with the fate he created for himself
frey also explains the whole pattern of this final soliloquy is thus grim parody of the opening one where decision is reached after not prior to the survey

learn how and when to remove this template message in the prologue the chorus introduces the reader to $john_faustus$ and his story
he is described as being base of stock however his intelligence and scholarship eventually earns him the degree of doctor at the university of wittenburg
$john_faustus$ tale is likened to that of icarus who flew too close to the sun and fell to his death when the sun melted his waxen wings
this is hint to $john_faustus$ #end# as well as bringing to the reader attention the idea of hubris excessive pride which is represented in the icarus story and ultimately $john_faustus$
during this opening the reader also gets first clue to the source of $john_faustus$ downfall $john_faustus$ comments that he has mastered every subject he has studied
he depreciates logic as merely being tool for arguing medicine as being unvalued unless it allowed raising the dead and immortality law as being mercenary and beneath him and divinity as useless because he feels that all humans commit sin and thus to have sins punishable by death complicates the logic of divinity
he dismisses it as what doctrine call you this que sera sera what will be shall be $john_faustus$ instructs his servant $wagner$ to summon $valdes$ and cornelius famous witchcrafter and famous magician respectively
two angels called the good angel and the bad angel appear to $john_faustus$ and dispense their own perspectives of his interest in magic and necromancy
though $john_faustus$ seems momentarily dissuaded he is apparently won over by the bad angel proclaiming how am glutted with conceit of this conceit meaning the possibilities magic offers to him
$valdes$ and cornnelius declare that if $john_faustus$ devotes himself to magic great #thing# are indeed possible with someone of $john_faustus$ learning and intelligence
$john_faustus$ absence is noted by two scholars who are less accomplished than $john_faustus$ himself they request that $wagner$ reveal $john_faustus$ present location request which $wagner$ at first haughtily denies then bombastically reveals
the two scholars worry about $john_faustus$ being corrupted by the #art# of magic and leave to inform the rector of the university
that night $john_faustus$ begins his attempt to summon #devil# in the presence of $lucifer$ and other #devil# although $john_faustus$ is unaware of their presence
after he creates magic circle and speaks an incantation through which he revokes his baptism demon a representative of the #devil# himself named $mephistophilis$ appears before him but $john_faustus$ is unable to tolerate the hideous looks of the demon and commands it to change its appearance
he tries to bind the demon to his service but is unable to because $mephistophilis$ already serves $lucifer$ who is also called the prince of #devil#
$mephistophilis$ also reveals that it was not $john_faustus$ power that summoned him but rather his abjuration of scriptures that results in the #devil# coming in the hope of claiming $john_faustus$ #soul#
$mephistophilis$ introduces the #history# of $lucifer$ and the other #devil# while indirectly telling $john_faustus$ that #hell# has no circumference nor limit and is more of state of mind than physical location
$john_faustus$ inquiries into the nature of #hell# lead to $mephistophilis$ saying oh $john_faustus$ leave these frivolous demands which strikes terror to my fainting #soul#
using $mephistophilis$ as messenger $john_faustus$ strikes deal with $lucifer$ he is to be allotted #year# of life on earth during which #time# he will have $mephistophilis$ as his personal servant and the ability to use magic however at the #end# he will give his #body# and #soul# over to $lucifer$ as payment and spend the rest of #time# as one damned to #hell#
$john_faustus$ seeing the obedience of the demon in changing its form takes pride in his skill this deal is to be sealed in the form of contract written in $john_faustus$ own #blood#
despite the dramatic nature of this divine intervention $john_faustus$ disregards the inscription with the assertion that he is already damned by his actions thus far and therefore left with no place to which he could flee
$mephistophilis$ brings coals to break the wound open again and thus $john_faustus$ is able to take his oath written in his own #blood#
after cutting his arm the wound is divinely healed and the latin #word# homo fuge $john_faustus$ begins by asking $mephistophilis$ series of science related questions
however the demon seems to be quite evasive and finishes with latin phrase per inoequalem motum respect totes through unequal motion with respect to the whole #thing#
this sentence has not the slightest scientific value thus giving the impression that $mephistophilis$ is untrustworthy $john_faustus$ then asks who made the #world# question which $mephistophilis$ refuses to answer $mephistophilis$ knows that god made the #world#
the good and evil angels return to $john_faustus$ the good angel urges him to repent and recant his oath to $lucifer$ but the evil angel sneers that $john_faustus$ will never repent
this is the largest fault of $john_faustus$ throughout the play he is blind to his own salvation and remains set on his #soul# damnation
when $john_faustus$ announces his intention to renounce magic and repent $mephistophilis$ storms away $lucifer$ accompanied by beelzebub and $mephistophilis$ appears to $john_faustus$ and frightens him into obedience to their pact
$lucifer$ then as an entertainment brings to $john_faustus$ the personification of the seven deadly sins $john_faustus$ fails to see them as warnings and ignores their implication
from this point until the #end# of the play although he gains great fame for his powers dr $john_faustus$ does nothing worthwhile having begun his pact with the attitude that he would be able to do anything
finally with his allotted #year# mostly expired and realizing that he has given up his #soul# for no good reason $john_faustus$ appears to scholars and warns them that he is damned and will not be long on the earth
instead he merely uses his temporary powers for practical jokes and frivolous demonstrations to the nobility he gives speech about how he is damned and eventually seems to repent for his deeds
at the #end# of the play on the eleventh hour $mephistophilis$ comes to collect $john_faustus$ #soul# and $john_faustus$ is dragged off the stage to #hell# by $mephistophilis$ and other #devil# even though dr $john_faustus$ tries to repent and beg for mercy from those #devil#
in the later text of the play there is subsequent scene where the three scholars discover his remains strewn about the stage they state that $john_faustus$ was damned one scholar declaring that the #devil# have torn him asunder but they determine because of $john_faustus$ learning to have him properly buried and mourned
$john_faustus$ says himself in the text what are #thou# $john_faustus$ but #man# condemned to die this section possibly contains original research

march learn how and when to remove this template message the theological implications of doctor $john_faustus$ have been the subject of considerable debate throughout the last century
among the most complicated points of contention is whether the play supports or challenges the calvinist doctrine of absolute predestination which dominated the lectures and writings of many english scholars in the latter half of the sixteenth century
according to calvin predestination meant that god acting of his own free will elects some people to be saved and others to be damned
this doctrine was the source of great controversy because it was seen by the so called anti calvinists to limit #man# free will in regard to faith and salvation and to present dilemma in terms of theodicy
at the #time# doctor $john_faustus$ was performed this doctrine was on the rise in england and under the direction of puritan theologians at cambridge and oxford had come to be considered the orthodox position of the church of england
nevertheless it remained the source of vigorous and at #time# heated debate between calvinist scholars such as william whitaker and william perkins and anti calvinists such as william barrett and peter baro
the dispute between these cambridge intellectuals had quite nearly reached its zenith by the #time# marlowe was student there in the and likely would have influenced him deeply as it did many of his fellow students
thus the individual has no control over his own ultimate fate concerning the fate of $john_faustus$ the calvinist concludes that his damnation was inevitable
his rejection of god and subsequent inability to repent are taken as evidence that he never really belonged to the elect but rather had been predestined from the very beginning for reprobation
in his chiefe points of christian religion theodore beza the successor to john calvin describes the category of sinner into which $john_faustus$ would most likely have been cast to conclude they which are most miserable of all those climb degree higher that their fall might be more grievous for they are raised so high by some gift of grace that they are little moved with some taste of the heavenly gift so that for the #time# they seem to have received the seed
but this is plain that the #spirit# of adoption which we have said to be only proper unto them which are never cast forth but are written in the secret of god people is never communicated to them for were they of the elect they should remain still with the elect
all these therefore because of necessity and yet willingly as they which are under the slavery of sin return to their vomit and fall away from faith are plucked up by the roots to be cast into the fire
for the calvinist $john_faustus$ represents the worst kind of sinner having tasted the heavenly gift and rejected it his damnation is justified and deserved because he was never truly adopted among the elect
according to this view the play demonstrates calvin three tiered concept of causation in which the damnation of $john_faustus$ is first willed by god then by satan and finally by himself
as calvin himself explains it in his institutes of christian religion we see therefore that it is no absurdity that one self act be ascribed to god to satan and to #man# but the diversity in the #end# and manner of doing causeth that therein appeareth the justice of god to be without fault and also the wickedness of satan and #man# bewrayeth itself to their reproach
one of the greatest critics of calvinism in marlowe day was peter baro who argued that such teachings fostered despair among believers rather than repentance among sinners
he claimed in fact that calvinism created theodical dilemma that this question so long debated of the philosophers most wise #man# and yet undetermined cannot even of divines and #man# endued with heavenly wisdom be discussed and decided
the anti calvinist view however finds such thinking repugnant and prefers to interpret doctor $john_faustus$ as criticism of such doctrines and that god #hath# in this case laid crosse upon learned #man# wherein they might perpetually torment themselves
baro recognised the threat of despair which faced the protestant church if it did not come to an agreement of how to understand the fundamentals
for him the calvinists were overcomplicating the issues of faith and repentance and thereby causing great and unnecessary confusion among struggling believers
$john_faustus$ himself confesses similar sentiment regarding predestination the reward of sin is death if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and there no truth in us
$john_faustus$ includes well known speech addressed to the summoned shade of $helen$ of troy in act scene i was this the face that launch thousand ships and burnt the topless towers of ilium sweet $helen$ make me immortal with kiss
why then belike we must sin ay we must die an everlasting death her lips suck forth my #soul# see where it flies
come $helen$ come give me my #soul# again here will dwell for heaven is in these lips and all is dross that is not helena
i will be paris and for love of thee instead of troy shall wertenberg be sack and will combat with weak menelaus and wear thy colours on my plumed crest yea will wound achilles in the heel and then return to $helen$ for kiss
o #thou# #art# fairer than the evening air clad in the beauty of thousand stars brighter #art# #thou# than flaming jupiter
when he appear to hapless semele more lovely than the monarch of the sky and none but #thou# shalt be my paramour
another well known passage comes after $john_faustus$ asks $mephistophilis$ how he $mephistophilis$ is out of #hell# to which $mephistophilis$ replies why this is #hell# nor am out of it
thinkt #thou# that i who saw the face of god and tasted the eternal joys of heaven am not tormented with ten thousand #hell#
in being deprived of everlasting bliss ravished by magic $john_faustus$ turns to the dark #art# when law logic science and theology fail to satisfy him
according to charles nicholl this places the play firmly in the elizabethan period when the problem of magic liberation or damnation was matter of debate and when renaissance occultism aimed at furthering of science
nicholl who connects $john_faustus$ as studious artisan to the hands on experience promoted by paracelsus sees in the former follower of the latter magician as technologist
readers initially feel sympathy for the demon when he attempts to explain to $john_faustus$ the consequences of abjuring god and heaven
$mephistophilis$ gives $john_faustus$ description of #hell# and the continuous horrors it possesses he wants $john_faustus$ to know what he is getting himself into before going through with the bargain
think st #thou# that who saw the face of god and tasted the eternal joy of heaven am not tormented with ten thousand #hell#
$mephistophilis$ is demon whom $john_faustus$ conjures up while first using magic in being deprived of everlasting bliss $john_faustus$ leave these frivolous demands which strikes terror to my fainting #soul#
however $john_faustus$ believes that supernatural powers are worth lifetime in #hell# say he $john_faustus$ surrender up to him $lucifer$ his #soul#
having thee $mephistophilis$ ever to attend on me marlowe argue that $mephistophilis$ depicts the sorrow that comes with separation from god
so he will spare him four and twenty #year# letting him live in all voluptuousness $mephistophilis$ is foreshadowing the pain $john_faustus$ would have to endure should he go through with his plan
in this facet $john_faustus$ can be likened to icarus whose insatiable ambition was the source of his misery and the cause of his plight
