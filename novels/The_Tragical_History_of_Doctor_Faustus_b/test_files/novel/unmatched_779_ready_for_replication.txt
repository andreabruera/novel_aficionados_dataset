in courts of kings where state is to patient judgments we appeal our plaud and speak for $john_faustus$ in his infancy
now is he born his parents base of stock in germany within a town call rhodes of riper #year# to wertenberg he went
so soon he profits in divinity the fruitful plot of scholarism grac that shortly he was grac with doctor #name# excelling all whose sweet delight disputes
in heavenly matters of theology till swoln with cunning of a self conceit his waxen wings did mount above his reach and melting heavens conspir his overthrow for falling to a devilish exercise and glutted now with learning golden gifts he surfeits upon cursed necromancy
whereas his kinsmen chiefly brought him up nothing so sweet as magic is to him which he prefers before his chiefest bliss

si peccasse negamus fallimur et nulla est in nobis veritas if we say that we have no sin we deceive ourselves and there no truth in us
reads stipendium peccati mors est ha stipendium the reward of sin is death that hard reads why then belike we must sin and so consequently die
ay we must die an everlasting death what doctrine call you this che sera sera what will be shall be divinity adieu
these metaphysics of magicians and necromantic #book# are heavenly #line# circles scenes letters and characters ay these are those that $john_faustus$ most desires

i ll have them read me strange philosophy and tell the secrets of all foreign kings i ll have them wall all germany with brass and make swift rhine circle fair wertenberg i ll have them fill the public schools with silk
wherewith the students shall be bravely clad i ll levy soldiers with the coin they bring and chase the prince of parma from our land and reign sole king of all the provinces yea stranger engines for the brunt of war than was the fiery keel at antwerp bridge

enter $valdes$ and cornelius come german $valdes$ and cornelius and make me blest with your sage conference yet not your #word# only but mine own fantasy that will receive no object for my head
philosophy is odious and obscure both law and physic are for petty wits divinity is basest of the three unpleasant harsh contemptible and vile
and i that have with concise syllogisms gravell the pastors of the german church and made the flowering pride of wertenberg swarm to my problems as the infernal #spirit# on sweet musaeus when he came to #hell# will be as cunning as agrippa was whose shadow made all europe honour him
but ruminates on necromantic skill tis magic magic that #hath# ravish me then gentle friends aid me in this attempt $valdes$
as indian moors obey their spanish #lord# so shall the #spirit# of every element be always serviceable to us three like lions shall they guard us when we please
like almain rutters with their horsemen staves or lapland giants trotting by our sides sometimes like women or unwedded maids shadowing more beauty in their airy brows than have the white breasts of the queen of love from
venice shall they drag huge argosies and from america the golden fleece that yearly stuffs old philip treasury if learned $john_faustus$ will be resolute
$john_faustus$ these #book# thy wit and our experience shall make all nations to canonize us $john_faustus$ $valdes$ as resolute am i in this
as #thou# to live therefore object it not cornelius the miracles that magic will perform will make thee vow to study nothing else
he that is grounded in astrology enrich with tongues well seen in minerals #hath# all the principles magic doth require then doubt not $john_faustus$ but to be renowm
the #spirit# tell me they can dry the sea and fetch the treasure of all foreign wrecks ay all the wealth that our forefathers hid within the massy entrails of the earth then tell me $john_faustus$ what shall we three want
come shew me some demonstrations magical that i may conjure in some lusty grove and have these joys in full possession
and more frequented for this mystery than heretofore the delphian oracle $john_faustus$ nothing cornelius this cheers my #soul# $valdes$ then haste thee to some solitary grove and bear wise bacon and albertus works the hebrew psalter and new testament
$valdes$ first let him know the #word# of #art# and then all other ceremonies learn $john_faustus$ may try his cunning by himself
and whatsoever else is requisite we will inform thee ere our conference cease cornelius $valdes$ first i ll instruct thee in the rudiments and then wilt #thou# be perfecter than i $john_faustus$
then come and dine with me and after meat we ll canvass every quiddity thereof for ere i sleep i ll try what i can do
this night i ll conjure though i die therefore exeunt enter two scholars first scholar i wonder what become of $john_faustus$ that was wont to make our schools ring with sic probo
second scholar that shall we know for see here comes his boy enter $wagner$ first scholar how now sirrah where thy master
$wagner$ god in heaven knows second scholar why dost not #thou# know $wagner$ yes i know but that follows not first scholar
that follows not necessary by force of argument that you being licentiates should stand upon therefore acknowledge your error and be attentive
go to sirrah leave your jesting and tell us where he is $wagner$ second scholar why didst #thou# not say #thou# knewest
$wagner$ have you any witness ont first scholar yes sirrah i heard you $wagner$ ask my fellow if i be a thief
yes #sir# i will tell you yet if you were not dunces you would never ask me such a question for is not he corpus naturale
second scholar well you will not tell us $wagner$ and is not that mobile then wherefore should you ask me such a question
but that i am by nature phlegmatic slow to wrath and prone to lechery to love i would say it were not for you to come within forty foot of the place of execution although i do not doubt to see you both hanged the next sessions
truly my dear brethren my master is within at dinner with $valdes$ and cornelius as this wine if it could speak would inform your worships and so the #lord# bless you preserve you and keep you my dear brethren my dear brethren
thus having triumphed over you i will set my countenance like a precisian and begin to speak thus #exit# first scholar
nay then i fear he is fallen into that damned #art# for which they two are infamous through the #world# second scholar
were he a stranger and not allied to me yet should i grieve for him but come let us go and inform the rector and see if he by his grave counsel can reclaim him
first scholar but i fear me nothing can reclaim him second scholar yet let us try what we can do
now that the gloomy shadow of the earth longing to view orion drizzling look leaps from th antartic #world# unto the sky and dims the welkin with her pitchy breath $john_faustus$ begin thine incantations and try if #devil# will obey thy hest seeing #thou# #hast# pray and sacrific to them
th abbreviated #name# of holy saints figures of every adjunct to the heavens and characters of signs and erring stars by which the #spirit# are enforc to rise
exeunt enter $john_faustus$ to conjure $john_faustus$ within this circle is jehovah #name# forward and backward anagrammatiz then fear not $john_faustus$ but be resolute and try the uttermost magic can perform sint mihi dei acherontis propitii
orientis princeps belzebub inferni ardentis monarcha et demogorgon propitiamus vos ut appareat et surgat $mephistophilis$ quod tumeraris per jehovam gehennam et consecratam aquam quam nunc spargo signumque crucis quod nunc facio et per vota nostra ipse nunc surgat nobis dicatus $mephistophilis$
i charge thee to return and change thy shape #thou# #art# too ugly to attend on me go and return an old franciscan friar that holy shape becomes a #devil# best
valeat numen triplex jehovoe ignei aerii aquatani spiritus salvete enter $mephistophilis$ #exit# $mephistophilis$ i see there virtue in my heavenly #word# who would not be proficient in this #art#
how pliant is this $mephistophilis$ full of obedience and humility such is the force of magic and my spells no $john_faustus$ #thou# #art# conjuror laureat
that canst command great $mephistophilis$ quin regis $mephistophilis$ fratris imagine re enter $mephistophilis$ like a franciscan friar mephist now $john_faustus$ what wouldst #thou# have me do
to do whatever $john_faustus$ shall command be it to make the moon drop from her sphere or the ocean to overwhelm the #world#
i am a servant to great $lucifer$ and may not follow thee without his leave no more than he commands must we perform
$john_faustus$ i charge thee wait upon me whilst i live mephist $john_faustus$ did not he charge thee to appear to me
mephist no i came hither of mine own accord $john_faustus$ did not my conjuring speeches raise thee speak mephist that was the cause but yet per accidens
for when we hear one rack the #name# of god abjure the scriptures and his saviour christ we fly in hope to get his glorious #soul# nor will we come unless he use such means whereby he is in danger to be damn
therefore the shortest cut for conjuring is stoutly to abjure the trinity and pray devoutly to the prince of #hell# $john_faustus$
so $john_faustus$ #hath# already done and holds this principle there is no chief but only belzebub to whom $john_faustus$ doth dedicate himself
this #word# damnation terrifies not him for he confounds #hell# in elysium his ghost be with the old philosophers but leaving these vain trifles of #man# #soul# tell me what is that $lucifer$
thy #lord# mephist arch regent and commander of all #spirit# $john_faustus$ was not that $lucifer$ an angel once mephist yes $john_faustus$ and most dearly lov of god
$john_faustus$ how comes it then that he is prince of #devil# mephist by aspiring pride and insolence for which god threw him from the face of heaven
$john_faustus$ and what are you that live with $lucifer$ mephist unhappy #spirit# that fell with $lucifer$ conspir against our god with $lucifer$ and are for ever damn with $lucifer$
$john_faustus$ where are you damn mephist in #hell# $john_faustus$ how comes it then that #thou# #art# out of #hell# mephist why this is #hell# nor am i out of it
think st #thou# that i who saw the face of god and tasted the eternal joys of heaven am not tormented with ten thousand #hell# in being depriv of everlasting bliss
o $john_faustus$ leave these frivolous demands which strike a terror to my fainting #soul# $john_faustus$ what is great $mephistophilis$ so passionate
for being deprived of the joys of heaven learn #thou# of $john_faustus$ manly fortitude and scorn those joys #thou# never shalt possess
go bear these tidings to great $lucifer$ seeing $john_faustus$ #hath# incurr eternal death by desperate thoughts against jove deity say he surrenders up to him his #soul#
having thee ever to attend on me to give me whatsoever i shall ask to tell me whatsoever i demand to slay mine enemies and aid my friends and always be obedient to my will
so he will spare him four and twenty #year# letting him live in all voluptuousness go and return to mighty $lucifer$ and meet me in my study at midnight and then resolve
me of thy master mind mephist i will $john_faustus$ #exit# $john_faustus$ had i as many #soul# as there be stars i give them all for $mephistophilis$
by him i ll be great #emperor# of the #world# and make a bridge thorough the moving air to pass the ocean with a band of #man# i ll join the hills that bind the afric shore and make that country continent to spain and both contributory to my crown
the #emperor# shall not live but by my leave nor any potentate of germany now that i have obtain what i desir i ll live in speculation of this #art# till $mephistophilis$ return again

$john_faustus$ why think st #thou# then that $john_faustus$ shall be damn mephist ay of necessity for here the scroll wherein #thou# #hast# given thy #soul# to $lucifer$
$john_faustus$ ay and #body# too but what of that think st #thou# that $john_faustus$ is so fond to imagine that after this life there is any pain
tush these are trifles and mere old wives tales mephist but $john_faustus$ i am an instance to prove the contrary for i am damn and am now in #hell#
$john_faustus$ how now in #hell# nay an this be #hell# i ll willingly be damn here what walking disputing but leaving off this let me have a wife

the iterating of these #line# brings gold the framing of this circle on the ground brings whirlwinds tempests thunder and lightning pronounce this thrice devoutly to thyself and #man# in armour shall appear to thee ready to execute what #thou# desir st $john_faustus$
hold take this #book# peruse it thoroughly gives #book# thanks $mephistophilis$ yet fain would i have a #book# wherein i might behold all spells and incantations that i might raise up #spirit# when i please
now would i have a #book# where i might see all characters and planets of the heavens that i might know their motions and dispositions

enter good angel and evil angel good angel $john_faustus$ repent yet god will pity thee evil angel #thou# #art# a #spirit# god cannot pity thee
$john_faustus$ who buzzeth in mine ears i am a #spirit# be i a #devil# yet god may pity me ay god will pity me if i repent
evil angel ay but $john_faustus$ never shall repent exeunt angels $john_faustus$ my heart so harden i cannot repent scarce can i #name# salvation faith or heaven but fearful echoes thunder in mine ears $john_faustus$ #thou# #art# damn
then swords and knives poison guns halters and envenom steel are laid before me to despatch myself and long ere this i should have slain myself
had not sweet pleasure conquer deep despair have not i made blind homer sing to me of alexander love and oenon death
and #hath# not he that built the walls of thebes with ravishing sound of his melodious harp made music with my $mephistophilis$
why should i die then or basely despair i am resolv $john_faustus$ shall ne er repent come $mephistophilis$ let us dispute again and argue of divine astrology
tell me are there many heavens above the moon are all celestial #body# but one globe as is the substance of this centric earth
and $john_faustus$ all jointly move upon one axletree whose terminine is term the #world# wide pole nor are the #name# of saturn mars or jupiter feign but are erring stars
mephist as are the elements such are the spheres mutually folded in each other orb $john_faustus$ but tell me have they all one motion both situ et tempore
all jointly move from east to west in twenty four hours upon the poles of the #world# but differ in their motion upon the poles of the zodiac
mephist $john_faustus$ tush these slender trifles $wagner$ can decide #hath# $mephistophilis$ no greater skill who knows not the double motion of the planets
the first is finish in a natural day the second thus as saturn in thirty #year# jupiter in twelve mars in four the sun venus and mercury in a #year# the moon in twenty eight days
