<p/>103 The Hoard Carried Off The Burning of Beowulf -LRB-XLIII.-RRB- 106 Addenda 109 -LSB-vii-RSB- PREFACE. The present work is a modest effort to reproduce approximately, in modern measures, the venerable epic, Beowulf.
<p/>Approximately , I repeat; for a very close reproduction of Anglo-Saxon verse would, to a large extent, be prose to a modern ear.
<p/>The Heyne-Socin text and glossary have been closely followed. Occasionally a deviation has been made, but always for what seemed good and sufficient reason.
<p/>Once in a while, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has added a conjecture of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own to the emendations quoted from the criticisms of other students of the poem.
<p/>The translator does not aim to be an editor. This work is addressed to two classes of readers. From both of these alike the translator begs sympathy and co-operation.
<p/>The student of English literature he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) aims to interest by giving him (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>), in modern garb, the most ancient epic of our race.
<p/>This is a bold and venturesome undertaking; and yet there must be some students of the Teutonic past willing to follow even a daring guide, if they may read in modern phrases of the sorrows of Hrothgar, of the prowess of Beowulf, and of the feelings that stirred the hearts of our forefathers in their primeval homes.
<p/>In order to please the larger class of readers, a regular cadence has been used, a measure which, while retaining the essential characteristics of the original, permits the reader to see ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) in reading.
<p/>The Anglo-Saxon scholar he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) hopes to please by adhering faithfully to the original. Perhaps every Anglo-Saxon scholar has his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) own theory as to how Beowulf should be translated.
<p/>Is it any reflection on our honored Kemble and Arnold to say that their translations fail to show a layman that Beowulf is justly called our first epic ?
<p/>Some have given us prose versions of what we believe to be a great poem. Of those translators who have used verse, several have written from what would seem a mistaken point of view.
<p/>Is it proper, for instance, that the grave and solemn speeches of Beowulf and Hrothgar be put in ballad measures, tripping lightly and airily along?
<p/>Or, again, is it fitting that the rough martial music of Anglo-Saxon verse be interpreted to us in the smooth measures of modern blank verse?
<p/>-LSB-viii-RSB- Of all English translations of Beowulf, that of Professor Garnett alone gives any adequate idea of the chief characteristics of this great Teutonic epic.
<p/>The measure used in the present translation is believed to be as near a reproduction of the original as modern English affords.
<p/>Do we hear what has been beautifully called ``the clanging tread of a warrior in mail''? The cadences closely resemble those used by Browning in some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Browning</b></font>) most striking poems.
<p/>The four stresses of the Anglo-Saxon verse are retained, and as much thesis and anacrusis is allowed as is consistent with a regular cadence.
<p/>Alliteration has been used to a large extent; but it was thought that modern ears would hardly tolerate it on every line.
<p/>End-rhyme has been used occasionally; internal rhyme, sporadically. Both have some warrant in Anglo-Saxon poetry. -LRB-For end-rhyme, see 1 53, 1 54; for internal rhyme, 2 21, 6 40.-RRB-
<p/>What Gummere-LSB-1-RSB- calls the ``rime-giver'' has been studiously kept; viz. , the first accented syllable in the second half-verse always carries the alliteration; and the last accented syllable alliterates only sporadically.
<p/>Alternate alliteration is occasionally used as in the original. -LRB-See 7 61, 8 5.-RRB- No two accented syllables have been brought together, except occasionally after a cæsural pause.
<p/>-LRB-See 2 19 and 12 1.-RRB- Or, scientifically speaking, Sievers's C type has been avoided as not consonant with the plan of translation.
<p/>Several of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sievers</b></font>) types, however, constantly occur; e.g.. A and a variant -LRB-/ x | / x-RRB- -LRB-/ x x | / x-RRB-
<p/>-LRB-x x / | x / -RRB-; a variant of D -LRB-/ x | / x x-RRB-; E -LRB-/ x x | / -RRB-.
<p/>; B and a variant -LRB-x / | x / -RRB- Anacrusis gives further variety to the types used in the translation.
<p/>-LRB- E.g. , 1 16 and 1 17: ``Lord'' and ``Wielder of Glory''; 1 30, 1 31, 1 32; 2 12 and 2 13; 2 27 and 2 28; 3 5 and 3 6.-RRB-
<p/>The parallelisms of the original have been faithfully preserved. Occasionally, some loss has been sustained; but, on the other hand, a gain has here and there been made.
<p/>The effort has been made to give a decided flavor of archaism to the translation. All words not in keeping with the spirit of the poem have been avoided.
<p/>Again, though many archaic words have been used, there are none, it is believed, which are not found in standard modern poetry.
<p/>-LSB-ix-RSB- With these preliminary remarks, it will not be amiss to give an outline of the story of the poem. THE STORY.
<p/>Hrothgar, king of the Danes, or Scyldings, builds a great mead-hall, or palace, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) hopes to feast his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) liegemen and to give them presents.
<p/>The joy of king and retainers is, however, of short duration. Grendel, the monster, is seized with hateful jealousy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) cannot brook the sounds of joyance that reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) fen-dwelling near the hall.
<p/>Thane after thane is ruthlessly carried off and devoured, while no one is found strong enough and bold enough to cope with the monster.
<p/>Oft and anon he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) goes to the joyous building, bent on direful mischief. For twelve years he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) persecutes Hrothgar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) vassals.
<p/>Over sea, a day's voyage off, Beowulf, of the Geats, nephew of Higelac, king of the Geats, hears of Grendel's doings and of Hrothgar's misery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) resolves to crush the fell monster and relieve the aged king. With fourteen chosen companions, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) sets sail for Dane-land.
<p/>Reaching that country, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) soon persuades Hrothgar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) ability to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>). The hours that elapse before night are spent in beer-drinking and conversation.
<p/>When Hrothgar's bedtime comes he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) leaves the hall in charge of Beowulf, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) that never before has he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) given to another the absolute wardship of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) palace.
<p/>All retire to rest, Beowulf, as it were, sleeping upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) arms. Grendel comes, the great march-stepper, bearing God's anger. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seizes and kills one of the sleeping warriors.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) advances towards Beowulf. A fierce and desperate hand-to-hand struggle ensues. No arms are used, both combatants trusting to strength and hand-grip.
<p/>Beowulf tears Grendel's shoulder from its socket, and the monster retreats to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) den, howling and yelling with agony and fury.
<p/>The wound is fatal. The next morning, at early dawn, warriors in numbers flock to the hall Heorot, to hear the news.
<p/>Joy is boundless. Glee runs high. Hrothgar and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) retainers are lavish of gratitude and of gifts. Grendel's mother, however, comes the next night to avenge his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) death.
<p/>-LSB-x-RSB- from the quarters of the other warriors, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seizes one of Hrothgar's favorite counsellors, and carries him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) off and devours him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is furious and raging. While Beowulf is sleeping in a room somewhat apart Beowulf is called. Determined to leave Heorot entirely purified, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) arms himself, and goes down to look for the female monster.
<p/>After traveling through the waters many hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) meets her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) near the sea-bottom. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) drags him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) den. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) sees Grendel lying dead.
<p/>After a desperate and almost fatal struggle with the woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) slays her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and swims upward in triumph, taking with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) Grendel's head.
<p/>Hrothgar literally pours treasures into the lap of Beowulf; and it is agreed among the vassals of the king that Beowulf will be their next liegelord.
<p/>Joy is renewed at Heorot. Congratulations crowd upon the victor. Beowulf leaves Dane-land. Hrothgar weeps and laments at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) departure. When the hero arrives in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) own land, Higelac treats him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) as a distinguished guest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) is the hero of the hour. Beowulf subsequently becomes king of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) own people, the Geats. After he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) has been ruling for fifty years, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) own neighborhood is wofully harried by a fire-spewing dragon.
<p/>Beowulf determines to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>). In the ensuing struggle both Beowulf and the dragon are slain. The grief of the Geats is inexpressible.
<p/>They determine, however, to leave nothing undone to honor the memory of their lord. A great funeral-pyre is built, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) body is burnt.
<p/>Then a memorial-barrow is made, visible from a great distance, that sailors afar may be constantly reminded of the prowess of the national hero of Geatland.
<p/>The poem closes with a glowing tribute to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) bravery, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) gentleness, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) goodness of heart, and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) generosity. * * * * *
<p/>It is the devout desire of this translator to hasten the day when the story of Beowulf shall be as familiar to English-speaking peoples as that of the Iliad.
<p/>Beowulf is our first great epic. It is an epitomized history of the life of the Teutonic races. It brings vividly before us our forefathers of pre-Alfredian eras, in their love of war, of sea, and of adventure.

<p/>III. GRENDEL THE MURDERER. -LCB-Grendel attacks the sleeping heroes-RCB- When the sun was sunken, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) set out to visit The lofty hall-building
<p/>, how the Ring-Danes had used it For beds and benches when the banquet was over. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) found there reposing many a noble 5 Asleep after supper; sorrow the heroes,-LSB-1-RSB-
<p/>-LCB-He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) drags off thirty of them, and devours them-RCB- Fell and frantic, and forced from their slumbers Thirty of thanemen; thence he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) departed 10 Leaping and laughing, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) lair to return to, With surfeit of slaughter sallying homeward.
<p/>In the dusk of the dawning, as the day was just breaking, Was Grendel's prowess revealed to the warriors: -LCB-A cry of agony goes up, when Grendel's horrible deed is fully realized.-RCB-
<p/>Misery knew not. The monster of evil Greedy and cruel tarried but little, Then, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) meal-taking finished, a moan was uplifted,
<p/>-LSB-6-RSB- When they had seen the track of the hateful pursuer, The spirit accursèd: too crushing that sorrow, -LCB-The monster returns the next night.-RCB-
<p/>15 Morning-cry mighty. The man-ruler famous, The long-worthy atheling, sat very woful, Suffered great sorrow, sighed for his (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) liegemen, 20 Too loathsome and lasting.
<p/>But one night after continued his (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) slaughter Shameless and shocking, shrinking but little From malice and murder; they mastered him (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) fully.
<p/>Not longer he (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) tarried, He (<font color='blue'><b>pursuer</b></font>) was easy to find then who otherwhere looked for 25 A pleasanter place of repose in the lodges,

<p/>45 The monster of evil fiercely did harass, The ill-planning death-shade, both elder and younger, Trapping and tricking them. He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) trod every night then The mist-covered moor-fens; men do not know where Witches and wizards wander and ramble.
<p/>So the foe of mankind many of evils Grievous injuries, often accomplished, Horrible hermit; Heort he (<font color='blue'><b>foe</b></font>) frequented, Gem-bedecked palace, when night-shades had fallen -LCB-God is against the monster.-RCB-

<p/>The clutch of the fire, no comfort shall look for, Wax no wiser; well for the man who, Living his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life-days, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Lord may face And find defence in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Father's embrace!

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) bade them prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) a bark that was trusty; He (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) the war-king would seek o'er the ocean, The folk-leader noble, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) needed retainers.
<p/>For the perilous project prudent companions Chided him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) little, though loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) dearly; 15 They egged the brave atheling, augured him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) glory.
<p/>The excellent knight from the folk of the Geatmen Had liegemen selected, likest to prove them Trustworthy warriors; with fourteen companions The vessel he (<font color='blue'><b>knight</b></font>) looked for; a liegeman then showed them, 20 A sea-crafty man, the bounds of the country.

<p/>The race of the Scyldings, o'er the roll of the waters; 10 I had lately begun then to govern the Danemen, The hoard-seat of heroes held in my youth,
<p/>Rich in its jewels: dead was Heregar, My kinsman and elder had earth-joys forsaken, Healfdene his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) bairn. He (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) was better than I am!
<p/>That feud thereafter for a fee I compounded; O'er the weltering waters to the Wilfings I sent Ornaments old; oaths did he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) swear me.
<p/>15 -LCB-Hrothgar recounts to Beowulf the horrors of Grendel's persecutions. -RCB- It pains me in spirit to any to tell it, What grief in Heorot Grendel hath caused me, 20
<p/>What horror unlooked-for, by hatred unceasing. Waned is my war-band, wasted my hall-troop; Weird hath offcast them to the clutches of Grendel.
<p/>God can easily hinder the scather From deeds so direful. Oft drunken with beer -LCB-My thanes have made many boasts, but have not executed them.-RCB-
<p/>25 O'er the ale-vessel promised warriors in armor They would willingly wait on the wassailing-benches A grapple with Grendel, with grimmest of edges.
<p/>30 The bench-deals all flooded, dripping and bloodied, The folk-hall was gory: I had fewer retainers, Dear-beloved warriors, whom death had laid hold of.
<p/>Then this mead-hall at morning with murder was reeking, The building was bloody at breaking of daylight, -LCB-Sit down to the feast, and give us comfort.-RCB-
<p/>Sit at the feast now, thy intents unto heroes,-LSB-2-RSB- Thy victor-fame show, as thy spirit doth urge thee!'' -LCB-A bench is made ready for Beowulf and his (<font color='blue'><b>warriors</b></font>) party.
<p/>In the beer-hall blithesome a bench was made ready; There warlike in spirit they went to be seated, Proud and exultant.
<p/>-RCB- 35 For the men of the Geats then together assembled, A liegeman did service, -LSB-19-RSB- Who a beaker embellished bore with decorum, -LCB-The gleeman sings-RCB- 40
<p/>And gleaming-drink poured. The gleeman sang whilom -LCB-The heroes all rejoice together.-RCB- Hearty in Heorot; there was heroes'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>rejoicing, A numerous war-band of Weders and Danemen.
<p/>-LSB-1-RSB- B. and S. reject the reading given in H.-So., and suggested by Grtvg. B. suggests for 457-458: wáere-ryhtum Þú, wine mín Béowulf, and for ár-stafum úsic sóhtest.
<p/>This means: From the obligations of clientage, my friend Beowulf, and for assistance thou hast sought us .--This gives coherence to Hrothgar's opening remarks in VIII., and also introduces a new motive for Beowulf's coming to Hrothgar's aid.
<p/>-LSB-2-RSB- Sit now at the feast, and disclose thy purposes to the victorious heroes, as thy spirit urges .--Kl. reaches the above translation by erasing the comma after <div class="bookquote">`meoto'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and reading <div class="bookquote">`sige-hrèðsecgum.'

<p/>Who sat at the feet of the lord of the Scyldings, Opened the jousting -LRB-the journey-LSB-1-RSB- of Beowulf, Sea-farer doughty, gave sorrow to Unferth 5
<p/>Unferth spoke up, Ecglaf his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) son, And greatest chagrin, too, for granted he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) never That any man else on earth should attain to,
<p/>Gain under heaven, more glory than he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>)-RRB-: -LCB-Did you take part in a swimming-match with Breca?-RCB- '' Art thou that Beowulf with Breca did struggle
<p/>, On the wide sea-currents at swimming contended, 10 Where to humor your pride the ocean ye tried, -LCB-'Twas mere folly that actuated you both to risk your lives on the ocean.-RCB-
<p/>From vainest vaunting adventured your bodies In care of the waters? And no one was able Nor lief nor loth one, in the least to dissuade you Your difficult voyage
<p/>; then ye ventured a-swimming, 15 Where your arms outstretching the streams ye did cover, The mere-ways measured, mixing and stirring them, Glided the ocean; angry the waves were, With the weltering of winter.
<p/>In the water's possession, Ye toiled for a seven-night; he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) at swimming outdid thee, 20 In strength excelled thee. Then early at morning On the Heathoremes' shore the holm-currents tossed him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>),
<p/>Beloved of his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) liegemen, the land of the Brondings, The peace-castle pleasant, where a people he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) wielded, -LSB-20-RSB- 25 Had borough and jewels.
<p/>Sought he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) thenceward the home of his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) fathers, The pledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) made thee -LCB-Breca outdid you entirely.-RCB- The son of Beanstan hath soothly accomplished.
<p/>Then I ween thou wilt find thee less fortunate issue, -LCB-Much more will Grendel outdo you, if you vie with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) in prowess.-RCB-
<p/>Though ever triumphant in onset of battle, A grim grappling, if Grendel thou darest 30 For the space of a night near-by to wait for!
<p/>Beowulf answered, offspring of Ecgtheow: ``My good friend Unferth, sure freely and wildly, -LCB-O friend Unferth, you are fuddled with beer, and cannot talk coherently.-RCB-
<p/>'' -LCB-Beowulf retaliates.-RCB- Thou fuddled with beer of Breca hast spoken, Hast told of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) journey! A fact I allege it, 35
<p/>We made agreement as the merest of striplings Promised each other -LRB-both of us then were -LCB-We simply kept an engagement made in early life.-RCB-
<p/>That greater strength in the waters I had then, Ills in the ocean, than any man else had. Younkers in years-RRB- that we yet would adventure 40 Out on the ocean; it all we accomplished.
<p/>While swimming the sea-floods, sword-blade unscabbarded Boldly we brandished, our bodies expected To shield from the sharks. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sure was unable -LCB-He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not excel me, and I would not excel him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).-RCB-
<p/>To swim on the waters further than I could, 45 More swift on the waves, nor would I from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go.
<p/>Then we two companions stayed in the ocean -LCB-After five days the currents separated us.-RCB- Five nights together, till the currents did part us,
<p/>The weltering waters, weathers the bleakest, And nethermost night, and the north-wind whistled 50 Fierce in our faces; fell were the billows.
<p/>And there against foemen my firm-knotted corslet, Hand-jointed, hardy, help did afford me; My battle-sark braided, brilliantly gilded, -LCB-A horrible sea-beast attacked me, but I slew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).-RCB-
<p/>The mere fishes' mood was mightily ruffled: 55 Lay on my bosom. To the bottom then dragged me, A hateful fiend-scather, seized me and held me,
<p/>Grim in his (<font color='blue'><b>Grim</b></font>) grapple: 'twas granted me, nathless, To pierce the monster with the point of my weapon, My obedient blade; battle offcarried 60
<p/>The mighty mere-creature by means of my hand-blow. -LSB-1-RSB- It has been plausibly suggested that 'síð' -LRB-in 501 and in 353-RRB- means <div class="bookquote">`arrival.'

<p/>With my dear-lovèd sword, as in sooth it was fitting; They missed the pleasure of feasting abundantly, 5 Ill-doers evil, of eating my body, Of surrounding the banquet deep in the ocean; But wounded with edges early at morning They were stretched a-high on the strand of the ocean, -LCB-I put a stop to the outrages of the sea-monsters.-RCB- Put to sleep with the sword, that sea-going travelers 10 No longer thereafter were hindered from sailing The foam-dashing currents.

<p/>-RCB- The blustering crags. Weird often saveth 15 The undoomed hero if doughty his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) valor! But me did it fortune-LSB-1-RSB- to fell with my weapon Nine of the nickers.
<p/>Of night-struggle harder `Neath dome of the heaven heard I but rarely, Nor of wight more woful in the waves of the ocean; 20 Yet I `scaped with my life the grip of the monsters, -LCB-After that escape I drifted to Finland.-RCB-
<p/>Then the waters bare me To the land of the Finns, the flood with the current, -LCB-I have never heard of your doing any such bold deeds.-RCB-
<p/>Weary from travel. The weltering waves. Not a word hath been told me Of deeds so daring done by thee, Unferth, 25
<p/>At the play of the battle, nor either of you two, Feat so fearless performèd with weapons Glinting and gleaming ... .
<p/>And of sword-terror none; never hath Breca . . -LSB-22-RSB- ... .
<p/>I utter no boasting; -LCB-You are a slayer of brothers, and will suffer damnation, wise as you may be. -RCB- 30
<p/>Though with cold-blooded cruelty thou killedst thy brothers, Thy nearest of kin; thou needs must in hell get Direful damnation, though doughty thy wisdom.
<p/>I tell thee in earnest, offspring of Ecglaf, Never had Grendel such numberless horrors, 35 The direful demon, done to thy liegelord, Harrying in Heorot, if thy heart were as sturdy, -LCB-Had your acts been as brave as your words, Grendel had not ravaged your land so long.-RCB-
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) hath found out fully that the fierce-burning hatred, The edge-battle eager, of all of your kindred, 40 Of the Victory-Scyldings, need little dismay him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>):
<p/>The monster is not afraid of the Danes,-RCB- Of the folk of the Danemen, but fighteth with pleasure, Killeth and feasteth, no contest expecteth -LCB-but he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) will soon learn to dread the Geats.-RCB- From Spear-Danish people.
<p/>Thy mood as ferocious as thou dost describe them. Oaths he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) exacteth, not any he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) spares -LCB- But the prowess and valor 45 Of the earls of the Geatmen early shall venture To give him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) a grapple.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) shall go who is able Bravely to banquet, when the bright-light of morning -LCB-On the second day, any warrior may go unmolested to the mead-banquet.-RCB-

<p/>Heard from Beowulf his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) bold resolution. There was laughter of heroes; loud was the clatter, 55 The words were winsome. Wealhtheow advanced then, -LCB-Queen Wealhtheow plays the hostess.-RCB-
<p/>Consort of Hrothgar, of courtesy mindful, Gold-decked saluted the men in the building, And the freeborn woman the beaker presented -LCB-She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) offers the cup to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband first.-RCB-
<p/>To the lord of the kingdom, first of the East-Danes, 60 Bade him (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) be blithesome when beer was a-flowing, Lief to his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) liegemen; he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) lustily tasted Of banquet and beaker, battle-famed ruler.

<p/>75 ``I purposed in spirit when I mounted the ocean, -LCB-I determined to do or die.-RCB- Deeds I shall do of daring and prowess,

<p/>Dead is Æschere, Yrmenlaf's brother, older than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>), 5 My true-hearted counsellor, trusty adviser, Shoulder-companion, when fighting in battle Our heads we protected, when troopers were clashing, -LCB-

<p/>In grewsomest manner, with grim-holding clutches, Since too long he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) had lessened my liege-troop and wasted My folk-men so foully. -LCB-

<p/>Arise, O king, quick let us hasten To look at the footprint of the kinsman of Grendel! 10 -LSB-49-RSB- Practice thou now patient endurance Of each of thy sorrows, as I hope for thee soothly!''
<p/>-LCB-Hrothgar rouses himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) horse is brought. -RCB- 15 Then up sprang the old one, the All-Wielder thanked he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>), Ruler Almighty, that the man had outspoken.
<p/>Then for Hrothgar a war-horse was decked with a bridle, Curly-maned courser. The clever folk-leader -LCB-They start on the track of the female monster.-RCB-
<p/>Stately proceeded: stepped then an earl-troop 20 Of linden-wood bearers. Her (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) footprints were seen then Widely in wood-paths, her (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) way o'er the bottoms, Where she (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) faraway
<p/>The son of the athelings then went o'er the stony, Declivitous cliffs, the close-covered passes, Narrow passages, paths unfrequented, Nesses abrupt, nicker-haunts many; One of a few of wise-mooded heroes, 30 He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) onward advanced to view the surroundings, Till he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) found unawares woods of the mountain O'er hoar-stones hanging, holt-wood unjoyful; The water stood under, welling and gory. `
<p/>Twas irksome in spirit to all of the Danemen, 35 Friends of the Scyldings, to many a liegeman -LCB-The sight of Æschere's head causes them great sorrow.-RCB-
<p/>Sad to be suffered, a sorrow unlittle To each of the earlmen, when to Æschere's head they Came on the cliff.
<p/>fared o'er fen-country murky, Bore away breathless the best of retainers Who pondered with Hrothgar the welfare of country. 25 The current was seething With blood and with gore -LRB-the troopers gazed on it-RRB-.
<p/>40 The horn anon sang the battle-song ready. The troop were all seated; they saw `long the water then -LCB-The water is filled with serpents and sea-dragons.-RCB-
<p/>Many a serpent, mere-dragons wondrous Trying the waters, nickers a-lying On the cliffs of the nesses, which at noonday full often 45
<p/>Go on the sea-deeps their sorrowful journey, Wild-beasts and wormkind; away then they hastened -LCB-One of them is killed by Beowulf.-RCB-
<p/>Hot-mooded, hateful, they heard the great clamor, The war-trumpet winding. One did the Geat-prince -LSB-50-RSB- Sunder from earth-joys, with arrow from bowstring, 50 From his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sea-struggle tore him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>),
<p/>that the trusty war-missile -LCB-The dead beast is a poor swimmer-RCB- Pierced to his (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) vitals; he (<font color='blue'><b>swimmer</b></font>) proved in the currents Less doughty at swimming whom death had offcarried.
<p/>Soon in the waters the wonderful swimmer Was straitened most sorely with sword-pointed boar-spears, 55 Pressed in the battle and pulled to the cliff-edge; The liegemen then looked on the loath-fashioned stranger.
<p/>-LCB-Beowulf prepares for a struggle with the monster.-RCB- Beowulf donned then his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) battle-equipments, Cared little for life; inlaid and most ample,
<p/>The hand-woven corslet which could cover his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) body, 60 Must the wave-deeps explore, that war might be powerless To harm the great hero, and the hating one's grasp might Not peril his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) safety; his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) head was protected By the light-flashing helmet that should mix with the bottoms, Trying the eddies, treasure-emblazoned, 65 Encircled with jewels, as in seasons long past The weapon-smith worked it, wondrously made it, With swine-bodies fashioned it, that thenceforward no longer
<p/>Brand might bite it, and battle-sword hurt it. And that was not least of helpers in prowess -LCB- He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) has Unferth's sword in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) hand.
<p/>-RCB- 70 That Hrothgar's spokesman had lent him (<font color='blue'><b>spokesman</b></font>) when straitened; And the hilted hand-sword was Hrunting entitled, Old and most excellent `mong all of the treasures; Its blade was of iron, blotted with poison,
<p/>Any hero under heaven in hand who it brandished, Who ventured to take the terrible journeys, The battle-field sought; not the earliest occasion That deeds of daring 'twas destined to `complish.
<p/>Hardened with gore; it failed not in battle 75 -LCB- Unferth has little use for swords.-RCB- Ecglaf's kinsman minded not soothly,
<p/>80 Exulting in strength, what erst he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) had spoken Drunken with wine, when the weapon he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) lent to A sword-hero bolder; himself did not venture `Neath the strife of the currents his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) life to endanger, -LSB-51-RSB- To fame-deeds perform; there he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) forfeited glory, 85 Repute for his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) strength.
<p/>Not so with the other When he (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) clad in his (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) corslet had equipped him (<font color='blue'><b>kinsman</b></font>) for battle. XXIII. BEOWULF'S FIGHT WITH GRENDEL'S MOTHER.
<p/>-LCB-Beowulf makes a parting speech to Hrothgar. -RCB- Beowulf spake, Ecgtheow's son: ``Recall now, oh, famous kinsman of Healfdene, Prince very prudent, now to part

<p/>The doughty-in-battle. Then a day's-length elapsed ere He (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) was able to see the sea at its bottom. Some one of men from above was exploring.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) body unscathèd: the burnie out-guarded, That she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) proved but powerless to pierce through the armor, The limb-mail locked, with loath-grabbing fingers.
<p/>Forth did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grab them, grappled the warrior With horrible clutches; yet no sooner she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) injured 30 The sea-wolf bare then, when bottomward came she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), -LCB-She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grabs him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>), and bears him (<font color='blue'><b>warrior</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) den.-RCB-

<p/>The earl then discovered he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) was down in some cavern 40 Where no water whatever anywise harmed him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>), And the clutch of the current could come not anear him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>), Since the roofed-hall prevented; brightness a-gleaming Fire-light he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) saw, flashing resplendent.
<p/>Flood-beasts no few with fierce-biting tusks did Break through his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) burnie, the brave one pursued they. The good one saw then the sea-bottom's monster, -LCB-Beowulf attacks the mother of Grendel.
<p/>The mighty mere-woman; he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) made a great onset With weapon-of-battle, his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) hand not desisted From striking, that war-blade struck on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head then A battle-song greedy.
<p/>-RCB- 45 The stranger perceived then -LCB-The sword will not bite. -RCB- The sword would not bite, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) life would not injure,
<p/>But the falchion failed the folk-prince when straitened: Erst had it often onsets encountered, Oft cloven the helmet, the fated one's armor: 'Twas the first time that ever the excellent jewel Had failed of its fame.
<p/>the hero-chief angry Cast then his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) carved-sword covered with jewels That it lay on the earth, hard and steel-pointed; -LCB-The hero throws down all weapons, and again trusts to his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) hand-grip.-RCB-

<p/>The hand-sword was bloody, the hero exulted. The brand was brilliant, brightly it glimmered, 15 Just as from heaven gemlike shineth The torch of the firmament.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) glanced `long the building, And turned by the wall then, Higelac's vassal Raging and wrathful raised his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) battle-sword Strong by the handle.
<p/>The edge was not useless 20 To the hero-in-battle, but he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) speedily wished to Give Grendel requital for the many assaults he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) Had worked on the West-Danes not once, but often, When he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) slew in slumber the subjects of Hrothgar, Swallowed down fifteen sleeping retainers 25
<p/>Of the folk of the Danemen, and fully as many Carried away, a horrible prey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) requital, grim-raging champion, -LCB-Beowulf sees the body of Grendel, and cuts off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) head.-RCB-
<p/>As the battle at Heorot erstwhile had scathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>); His (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) body far bounded, a blow when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) suffered, Death having seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>), sword-smiting heavy, And he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) cut off his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) head then.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) saw on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>) rest-place weary of conflict Grendel lying, of life-joys bereavèd, 30 Early this noticed The clever carles who as comrades of Hrothgar -LCB-The waters are gory.-RCB-
<p/>35 Gazed on the sea-deeps, that the surging wave-currents Were mightily mingled, the mere-flood was gory: Of the good one the gray-haired together held converse, -LCB-Beowulf is given up for dead.-RCB-
<p/>The hoary of head, that they hoped not to see again The atheling ever, that exulting in victory 40 He (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>)'d return there to visit the distinguished folk-ruler:
<p/>-LSB-55-RSB- Then many concluded the mere-wolf had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>).-LSB-1-RSB- The ninth hour came then. From the ness-edge departed The bold-mooded Scyldings; the gold-friend of heroes Homeward betook him (<font color='blue'><b>Hrothgar</b></font>).
<p/>The strangers sat down then 45 Soul-sick, sorrowful, the sea-waves regarding: They wished and yet weened not their well-loved friend-lord -LCB-The giant-sword melts.-RCB-
<p/>The sword-blade began then, The blood having touched it, contracting and shriveling With battle-icicles; 'twas a wonderful marvel 50 That it melted entirely, likest to ice when The Father unbindeth the bond of the frost and Unwindeth the wave-bands, He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) who wieldeth dominion Of times and of tides: a truth-firm Creator.
<p/>Nor took he (<font color='blue'><b>Creator</b></font>) of jewels more in the dwelling, 55 Lord of the Weders, though they lay all around him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), Than the head and the handle handsome with jewels; -LSB-56-RSB- The brand early melted, burnt was the weapon:-LSB-2-RSB-
<p/>To see any more. So hot was the blood, the strange-spirit poisonous -LCB-The hero swims back to the realms of day.
<p/>-RCB- That in it did perish. He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) early swam off then 60 Who had bided in combat the carnage of haters
<p/>, Went up through the ocean; the eddies were cleansèd, The spacious expanses, when the spirit from farland His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) life put aside and this short-lived existence.
<p/>The seamen's defender came swimming to land then 65 Doughty of spirit, rejoiced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) sea-gift, The bulky burden which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) bore in his (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>) keeping.
<p/>The excellent vassals advanced then to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Doughty</b></font>), To God they were grateful, were glad in their chieftain, That to see him (<font color='blue'><b>chieftain</b></font>) safe and sound was granted them.
<p/>From the high-minded hero, then, helmet and burnie Were speedily loosened: the ocean was putrid, The water `neath welkin weltered with gore.
<p/>70 Forth did they fare, then, their footsteps retracing, Merry and mirthful, measured the earth-way, 75 The highway familiar: men very daring-LSB-3-RSB- Bare then the head from the sea-cliff, burdening Each of the earlmen, excellent-valiant.

<p/>fourteen most-valiant And battle-brave Geatmen came there going Straight to the palace: the prince of the people Measured the mead-ways, their mood-brave companion.
<p/>The atheling of earlmen entered the building, 85 Deed-valiant man, adorned with distinction, Doughty shield-warrior, to address King Hrothgar: -LSB-57-RSB- Then hung by the hair, the head of Grendel Was borne to the building, where beer-thanes were drinking, Loth before earlmen and eke `fore the lady:

<p/>of the thing agreed on. The first passage -LRB-v. 1599 -LRB-b-RRB--1600-RRB- I translate literally: Then many agreed upon this -LRB-namely-RRB-, that the sea-wolf had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sweet</b></font>) .

<p/>this same idiom occurs, and was noticed in B.'s great article on Beowulf, which appeared about the time I published my reading of 1599 and 2027.

<p/>The hoard-ward distinguished the speech of a man; Time was no longer to look out for friendship. The breath of the monster issued forth first, Vapory war-sweat, out of the stone-cave: -LCB-The terrible encounter.

<p/>The blood-stainèd trace of Swedes and Geatmen, The death-rush of warmen, widely was noticed, How the folks with each other feud did awaken.
<p/>The worthy one went then-LSB-1-RSB- with well-beloved comrades, 5 Old and dejected to go to the fastness, Ongentheo earl upward then turned him (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>); Of Higelac's battle he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>)'d heard on inquiry, The exultant one's prowess, despaired of resistance, With earls of the ocean to be able to struggle, 10 `Gainst sea-going sailors to save the hoard-treasure, His (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) children; he (<font color='blue'><b>earl</b></font>) fled after thenceward Old `neath the earth-wall.
<p/>-LCB- The messenger continues, and refers to the feuds of Swedes and Geats.-RCB- '' Then was offered pursuance To the braves of the Swedemen, the banner-LSB-2-RSB- to Higelac.
<p/>Then with edges of irons was Ongentheow driven, The gray-haired to tarry, that the troop-ruler had to Suffer the power solely of Eofor:
<p/>-LSB-100-RSB- They fared then forth o'er the field-of-protection, 15 When the Hrethling heroes hedgeward had thronged them. -LCB-Wulf wounds Ongentheow. -RCB-
<p/>20 Wonred his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulf</b></font>) son, that for swinge of the edges The blood from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulf</b></font>) body burst out in currents, Forth `neath his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulf</b></font>) hair.
<p/>Wulf then wildly with weapon assaulted him (<font color='blue'><b>Wulf</b></font>), He (<font color='blue'><b>Wulf</b></font>) feared not however, Gray-headed Scylfing, but speedily quited -LCB-Ongentheow gives a stout blow in return.-RCB-
<p/>The wasting wound-stroke with worse exchange, 25 When the king of the thane-troop thither did turn him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>): The wise-mooded son of Wonred was powerless To give a return-blow to the age-hoary man, But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head-shielding helmet first hewed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to pieces,
<p/>That flecked with gore perforce he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did totter, 30 Fell to the earth; not fey was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) yet then, But up did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spring though an edge-wound had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Then Higelac's vassal, valiant and dauntless, When his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother lay dead, made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broad-bladed weapon, Giant-sword ancient, defence of the giants, 35 Bound o'er the shield-wall; the folk-prince succumbed then, -LCB-Ongentheow is slain.-RCB-
<p/>There were many attendants who bound up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kinsman, Carried him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quickly when occasion was granted That the place of the slain they were suffered to manage.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) armor of iron from Ongentheow ravished, His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hard-sword hilted and helmet together; -LCB-Eofor takes the old king's war-gear to Higelac.-RCB-
<p/>-LCB-Eofor smites Ongentheow fiercely.-RCB- Shepherd of people, was pierced to the vitals. 40 This pending, one hero plundered the other, The old one's equipments he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) carried to Higelac.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) the jewels received, and rewards `mid the troopers 45 Graciously promised, and so did accomplish: The king of the Weders requited the war-rush, Hrethel's descendant, when home he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) repaired him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), -LCB-Higelac rewards the brothers.-RCB-
<p/>To Eofor and Wulf with wide-lavished treasures, To each of them granted a hundred of thousands -LSB-101-RSB- 50 In land and rings wrought out of wire: -LCB-His (<font color='blue'><b>Wulf</b></font>) gifts were beyond cavil.-RCB-

<p/>And to Eofor then gave he (<font color='blue'><b>Wulf</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Wulf</b></font>) one only daughter, The honor of home, as an earnest of favor. 55 That's the feud and hatred--as ween I `twill happen--
<p/>The anger of earthmen, that earls of the Swedemen Will visit on us, when they hear that our leader Lifeless is lying, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) who longtime protected His (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) hoard and kingdom `gainst hating assailers,
<p/>What best did avail them, and further moreover -LCB-It is time for us to pay the last marks of respect to our lord.-RCB-
<p/>Now is haste most fitting, That the lord of liegemen we look upon yonder, 65 And that one carry on journey to death-pyre
<p/>60 Who on the fall of the heroes defended of yore The deed-mighty Scyldings,-LSB-4-RSB- did for the troopers Hero-deeds `complished. Who ring-presents gave us.
<p/>Not aught of it all Shall melt with the brave one--there's a mass of bright jewels, Gold beyond measure, grewsomely purchased And ending it all ornament-rings too 70 Bought with his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) life; these fire shall devour, Flame shall cover, no earlman shall wear A jewel-memento, nor beautiful virgin
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) shall oft with others be exiled and banished, Since the leader of liegemen hath laughter forsaken, -LSB-102-RSB- Mirth and merriment.
<p/>Hence many a war-spear Cold from the morning shall be clutched in the fingers, Heaved in the hand, no harp-music's sound shall
<p/>Have on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) neck rings to adorn her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), But wretched in spirit bereavèd of gold-gems 75 80 Waken the warriors, but
<p/>the wan-coated raven Fain over fey ones freely shall gabble, Shall say to the eagle how he (<font color='blue'><b>Fain</b></font>) sped in the eating,
<p/>So the high-minded hero was rehearsing these stories 85 Loathsome to hear; he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) lied as to few of -LCB-The warriors go sadly to look at Beowulf's lifeless body.-RCB-
<p/>When, the wolf his (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) companion, he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) plundered the slain. '' Weirds and of words. All the war-troop arose then, `Neath the Eagle's Cape sadly betook them, Weeping and woful, the wonder to look at.
<p/>They saw on the sand then soulless a-lying, 90 His (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) slaughter-bed holding, him (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) who rings had given them In days that were done; then the death-bringing moment Was come to the good one, that the king very warlike, Wielder of Weders, with wonder-death perished.
<p/>The worm on the field, in front of them lying, The foeman before them: the fire-spewing dragon, Ghostly and grisly guest in his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) terrors, Was scorched in the fire; as he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) lay there he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) measured Fifty of feet; came forth in the night-time-LSB-5-RSB- 100
<p/>First they beheld there a creature more wondrous, -LCB-They also see the dragon.-RCB- 95 To rejoice in the air, thereafter departing To visit his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) den; he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) in death was then fastened
<p/>, He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) would joy in no other earth-hollowed caverns. There stood round about him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) beakers and vessels, Dishes were lying and dear-valued weapons, 105
<p/>With iron-rust eaten, as in earth's mighty bosom A thousand of winters there they had rested: -LCB- The hoard was under a magic spell.
<p/>That mighty bequest then with magic was guarded, Gold of the ancients, that earlman not any The ring-hall could touch, save Ruling-God only, -LSB-103-RSB- 110 Sooth-king of Vict`ries gave whom He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) wished to -LCB-God alone could give access to it.-RCB-

<p/>--The H.-So. reading, as translated in our text, means that the banner of the enemy was captured and brought to Higelac as a trophy.
<p/>The rendering given in this translation represents the king as being generous beyond the possibility of reproach; but some authorities construe <div class="bookquote">`him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)'  (<font color='red'><b>some authorities</b></font>)</div>-LRB-2996-RRB- as plu., and understand the passage to mean that no one reproached the two brothers with having received more reward than they were entitled to.
<p/>The name <div class="bookquote">`Scyldingas'  (<font color='red'><b>Hrothgar/HROTHGAR/-- Son of Hrothgar</b></font>)</div>here -LRB-3006-RRB- has caused much discussion, and given rise to several theories, the most important of which are as follows: -LRB-1-RRB- After the downfall of Hrothgar's family, Beowulf was king of the Danes, or Scyldings.

<p/>Of these a good part were avoided by Harrison and Sharp, the American editors of Beowulf, in their last edition, 1888.
<p/>Several discrepancies and other oversights have been noticed in the H.-So. glossary. The rest will, I hope, be noticed in their fourth edition.
<p/>As, however, this book may fall into the hands of some who have no copy of the American edition, it seems best to notice all the principal oversights of the German editors.
