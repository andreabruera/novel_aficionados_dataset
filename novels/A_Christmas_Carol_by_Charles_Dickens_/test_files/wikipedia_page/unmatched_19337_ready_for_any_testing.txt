the writer charles dickens was born to middle class family which got into financial difficulties as result of the spendthrift nature of his father john
dickens aged was forced to pawn his collection of books leave school and work at dirty and rat infested shoe blacking factory
the change in circumstances gave him what his biographer michael slater describes as deep personal and social outrage which heavily influenced his writing and outlook
by the end of dickens was well established author having written six major works as well as several short stories novellas and other pieces
in john was committed to the marshalsea debtors prison in southwark london the novel was his favourite work but sales were disappointing and he faced temporary financial difficulties
the christmas tree had been introduced in britain during the century and its use was popularised by queen victoria and prince albert
celebrating the christmas season had been growing in popularity through the victorian era their practice was copied in many homes across the country
in the early century there had been revival of interest in christmas carols following decline in popularity over the previous hundred year
they were formerly sung in the west of england and william sandys collection christmas carols ancient and modern led to growth in the form popularity in britain
dickens had an interest in christmas and his first story on the subject was christmas festivities published in bell weekly messenger in the story was then published as a christmas dinner in sketches by boz
the publication of davies gilbert work some ancient christmas carols with the tunes to which the story of the goblins who stole sexton another christmas story appeared in the novel the pickwick papers
in the episode mr wardle relates the tale of gabriel grub lonely and mean spirited sexton who undergoes christmas conversion after being visited by goblins who show him the past and future
slater considers that the main elements of the carol are present in the story but not yet in firm form the story is followed by passage about christmas in dickens editorial master humphrey clock
the professor of english literature paul davis writes that although the goblins story appears to be prototype of christmas carol all dickens earlier writings about christmas influenced the story
among earlier authors who influenced dickens was washington irving whose work the sketch book of geoffrey crayon gent included four essays on old english christmas traditions that he experienced while staying at aston hall near birmingham
the tales and essays attracted dickens and the two authors shared the belief that the staging of nostalgic english christmas might help restore the social harmony that they felt had been lost in the modern world
several works may have had an influence on the writing of christmas carol including two douglas jerrold essays one from an issue of punch how mr chokepear keeps merry christmas and one from the beauties of the police
more broadly dickens was influenced by fairy tales and nursery stories which he closely associated with christmas because he saw them as stories of conversion and transformation
charles dickens in the year before the publication of christmas carol dickens was touched by the lot of poor child in the middle decades of the century
dickens was not the first author to celebrate the christmas season in literature in early he toured the cornish tin mines where he was angered by seeing child working in appalling conditions
the suffering he witnessed there was reinforced by visit to the field lane ragged school one of several london schools set up for the education of the capital half starved illiterate street child
in february the second report of the child employment commission was published it was parliamentary report exposing the effects of the industrial revolution upon working class child
horrified by what he read dickens planned to publish an inexpensive political pamphlet tentatively titled an appeal to the people of england on behalf of the poor man child but changed his mind deferring the pamphlet production until the end of the year
in march he wrote to dr southwood smith one of the four commissioners responsible for the second report about his change in plans you will certainly feel that sledge hammer has come down with twenty time the force twenty thousand time the force
in fundraising speech on october at the manchester athenaeum dickens urged workers and employers to join together to combat ignorance with educational reform and realised in the day following that the most effective way to reach the broadest segment of the population with his social concerns about poverty and injustice was to write deeply felt christmas narrative rather than polemical pamphlets and essays
i could exert by following out my first idea john leech illustrator of the first edition by mid dickens began to suffer from financial problems
sales of martin chuzzlewit were falling off and his wife catherine was pregnant with their fifth child matters worsened when chapman hall his publishers threatened to reduce his monthly income by if sales dropped further
michael slater dickens biographer describes the book as being written at white heat it was completed in six weeks the final pages being written in early december
he built much of the work in his head while taking night time walks of to miles to km around london
dickens sister in law wrote how he wept and laughed and wept again and excited himself in most extraordinary manner in composition
slater says that christmas carol was intended to open its readers heart towards those struggling to survive on the lower rungs of the economic ladder and to encourage practical benevolence but also to warn of the terrible danger to society created by the toleration of widespread ignorance and actual want among the poor
george cruikshank the illustrator who had earlier worked with dickens on sketches by boz and oliver twist introduced him to the caricaturist john leech
by october dickens invited leech to work on christmas carol and four hand coloured etchings and four black and white wood engravings by the artist accompanied the text
dickens hand written manuscript of the story does not include the sentence in the penultimate paragraph and to tiny_tim who did not die this was added later during the printing process
the central character of christmas carol is ebenezer mr_scrooge miserly london based moneylender described in the story as a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner
kelly writes that mr_scrooge may have been influenced by dickens conflicting feelings for his father whom he both loved and demonised
he began christmas carol in october john elwes also called john the miser one of the models for mr_scrooge this psychological conflict may be responsible for the two radically different scrooges in the tale
robert douglas fairhurst the professor of english literature considers that in the opening part of the book covering young mr_scrooge lonely and unhappy childhood and his aspiration for money to avoid poverty is something of self parody of dickens
one cold stingy and greedy semi recluse the other benevolent sociable man fears about himself the post transformation parts of the book are how dickens optimistically sees himself
mr_scrooge could also be based on two misers the eccentric john elwes mp or jemmy wood the owner of the gloucester old bank and also known as the gloucester miser
are reflection of sarcastic question raised by the philosopher thomas carlyle are there not treadmills gibbets even hospitals poor rates new poor law
while the miser questions are there no prisons the treadmill and the poor law are in full vigour then there are literary precursors for mr_scrooge in dickens own works
peter_cratchit ackroyd dickens biographer sees similarities between the character and the elder martin chuzzlewit character although the miser is a more fantastic image than the chuzzlewit patriarch ackroyd observes that chuzzlewit transformation to charitable figure is parallel to that of the miser
douglas fairhurst sees that the minor character gabriel grub from the pickwick papers was also an influence when creating mr_scrooge scrooge name came from tombstone dickens had seen on visit to edinburgh
the grave was for ebenezer lennox scroggie whose job was given as meal man a corn merchant dickens misread the inscription as mean man
when dickens was young he lived near tradesman premises with the sign goodge and marney which may have provided the name for mr_scrooge former business partner
for the chained jacob_marley dickens drew on his memory of visit to the western penitentiary in pittsburgh pennsylvania in march where he saw and was affected by seeing fettered prisoners
for the character tiny_tim dickens used his nephew henry disabled boy who was five at the time christmas carol was written
the two figures of want and ignorance sheltering in the robes of the ghost of christmas present were inspired by the child dickens had seen on his visit to ragged school in the east end of london
some writers including grace moore the dickens scholar consider that there is christian theme running through christmas carol and that the novella should be seen as an allegory of the christian concept of redemption
dickens biographer claire tomalin sees the conversion of mr_scrooge as carrying the christian message that even the worst of sinners may repent and become good man
ignorance and want from the original edition the transformation of mr_scrooge is central to the story he based his beliefs and principles on the new testament
dickens statement that jacob_marley had no bowels is reference to the bowels of compassion mentioned in the first epistle of john the reason for his eternal damnation
the dickens scholar john jordan argues that christmas carol shows what dickens referred to in letter to his friend john forster as his carol philosophy cheerful views sharp anatomisation of humbug jolly good temper and vein of glowing hearty generous mirthful beaming reference in everything to home and fireside
from secular viewpoint the cultural historian penne restad suggests that mr_scrooge redemption underscores the conservative individualistic and patriarchal aspects of dickens carol philosophy of charity and altruism
dickens wrote christmas carol in response to british social attitudes towards poverty particularly child poverty and wished to use the novella as means to put forward his arguments against it
the story shows mr_scrooge as paradigm for self interest and the possible repercussions of ignoring the poor especially child in poverty
other writers including kelly consider that dickens put forward secular vision of this sacred holiday personified by the allegorical figures of want and ignorance
douglas fairhurst observes that the use of such figures allowed dickens to present his message of the need for charity without alienating his largely middle class readership
as the result of the disagreements with chapman and hall over the commercial failures of martin chuzzlewit dickens arranged to pay for the publishing himself in exchange for percentage of the profits
the two figures were created to arouse sympathy with readers as was tiny_tim first edition frontispiece and title page production of christmas carol was not without problems
the first printing contained drab olive endpapers that dickens felt were unacceptable and the publisher chapman and hall quickly replaced them with yellow endpapers but once replaced those clashed with the title page which was then redone
the final product was bound in red cloth with gilt edged pages completed only two day before the publication date of december
following publication dickens arranged for the manuscript to be bound in red morocco leather and presented as gift to his solicitor thomas mitton
chapman and hall issued second and third editions before the new year and the book continued to sell well into
priced at five shillings equal to in pounds the first run of copies sold out by christmas eve by the end of eleven more editions had been released
since its initial publication the book has been issued in numerous hardback and paperback editions translated into several languages and has never been out of print
it was dickens most popular book in the united states and sold over two million copies in the hundred year following its first publication there
the high production costs upon which dickens insisted led to reduced profits and the first edition brought him only equal to in pounds he expected
year later the profits were only and dickens was deeply disappointed he wrote that christmas carol was a national benefit and to every man or woman who reads it personal kindness
according to douglas fairhurst contemporary reviews of christmas carol were almost uniformly kind the illustrated london news described how the story impressive eloquence
its unfeigned lightness of heart its playful and sparkling humour its gentle spirit of humanity all put the reader in good humour with ourselves with each other with the season and with the author

the religious press generally ignored the tale but in january christian remembrancer thought the tale old and hackneyed subject was treated in an original way and praised the author sense of humour and pathos
the writer and social thinker john ruskin told friend that he thought dickens had taken the religion from christmas and had imagined it as mistletoe and pudding neither resurrection from the dead nor rising of new stars nor teaching of wise man nor shepherds

the ghost of christmas present from the original edition in january parley illuminated library published an unauthorised version of the story in condensed form which they sold for twopence
let us be the sledge hammer in this or shall be beset by hundreds of the same crew when come out with long story
i have not the least doubt that if these vagabonds can be stopped they must the publishers declared themselves bankrupt and dickens was left to pay in costs
the small profits dickens earned from christmas carol further strained his relationship with his publishers and he broke with them in favour of bradbury and evans who had been printing his works to that point
dickens returned to the tale several time during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation he capitalised on the success of the book by publishing other christmas stories the chimes the cricket on the hearth

in the early century the celebration of christmas was associated in britain with the countryside and peasant revels disconnected to the increasing urbanisation and industrialisation taking place
davis considers that in christmas carol dickens showed that christmas could be celebrated in towns and cities despite increasing modernisation the modern observance of christmas is largely the result of mid victorian revival of the holiday
the oxford movement of the and had produced resurgence of the traditional rituals and religious observances associated with christmastide and with christmas carol dickens captured the zeitgeist while he reflected and reinforced his vision of christmas

whether the christmas visions would or would not convert mr_scrooge they convert us the film versions of the were different in the uk and us
british made films showed traditional telling of the story while us made works showed bob_cratchit in more central role escaping the depression caused by european bankers and celebrating what davis calls the christmas of the common man

he had all the prejudices of his time he had for instance that dislike of defined dogmas which really means preference for unexamined dogmas
