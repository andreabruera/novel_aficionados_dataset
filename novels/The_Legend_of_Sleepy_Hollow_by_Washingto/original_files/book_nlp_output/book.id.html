<p/>A pleasing land of drowsy head it was, Of dreams that wave before the half-shut eye; And of gay castles in the clouds that pass, Forever flushing round a summer sky.
<p/>In the bosom of one of those spacious coves which indent the eastern shore of the Hudson, at that broad expansion of the river denominated by the ancient Dutch navigators the Tappan Zee, and where they always prudently shortened sail and implored the protection of St. Nicholas when they crossed, there lies a small market town or rural port, which by some is called Greensburgh, but which is more generally and properly known by the name of Tarry Town.
<p/>This name was given, we are told, in former days, by the good housewives of the adjacent country, from the inveterate propensity of their husbands to linger about the village tavern on market days.
<p/>Be that as it may, I do not vouch for the fact, but merely advert to it, for the sake of being precise and authentic.
<p/>Not far from this village, perhaps about two miles, there is a little valley or rather lap of land among high hills, which is one of the quietest places in the whole world.
<p/>A small brook glides through it, with just murmur enough to lull one to repose; and the occasional whistle of a quail or tapping of a woodpecker is almost the only sound that ever breaks in upon the uniform tranquillity.
<p/>I recollect that, when a stripling, my first exploit in squirrel-shooting was in a grove of tall walnut-trees that shades one side of the valley.
<p/>I had wandered into it at noontime, when all nature is peculiarly quiet, and was startled by the roar of my own gun, as it broke the Sabbath stillness around and was prolonged and reverberated by the angry echoes.
<p/>If ever I should wish for a retreat whither I might steal from the world and its distractions, and dream quietly away the remnant of a troubled life, I know of none more promising than this little valley.
<p/>From the listless repose of the place, and the peculiar character of its inhabitants, who are descendants from the original Dutch settlers, this sequestered glen has long been known by the name of SLEEPY HOLLOW, and its rustic lads are called the Sleepy Hollow Boys throughout all the neighboring country.
<p/>Some say that the place was bewitched by a High German doctor, during the early days of the settlement; others, that an old Indian chief, the prophet or wizard of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) tribe, held his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) powwows there before the country was discovered by Master Hendrick Hudson.
<p/>Certain it is, the place still continues under the sway of some witching power, that holds a spell over the minds of the good people, causing them to walk in a continual reverie.
<p/>They are given to all kinds of marvellous beliefs, are subject to trances and visions, and frequently see strange sights, and hear music and voices in the air.
<p/>The whole neighborhood abounds with local tales, haunted spots, and twilight superstitions; stars shoot and meteors glare oftener across the valley than in any other part of the country, and the nightmare, with her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) whole ninefold, seems to make it the favorite scene of her (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) gambols.
<p/>The dominant spirit, however, that haunts this enchanted region, and seems to be commander-in-chief of all the powers of the air, is the apparition of a figure on horseback, without a head.
<p/>It is said by some to be the ghost of a Hessian trooper, whose head had been carried away by a cannon-ball, in some nameless battle during the Revolutionary War, and who is ever and anon seen by the country folk hurrying along in the gloom of night, as if on the wings of the wind.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) haunts are not confined to the valley, but extend at times to the adjacent roads, and especially to the vicinity of a church at no great distance.
<p/>Indeed, certain of the most authentic historians of those parts, who have been careful in collecting and collating the floating facts concerning this spectre, allege that the body of the trooper having been buried in the churchyard, the ghost rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) head, and that the rushing speed with which he (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) sometimes passes along the Hollow, like a midnight blast, is owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>trooper</b></font>) being belated, and in a hurry to get back to the churchyard before daybreak.
<p/>Such is the general purport of this legendary superstition, which has furnished materials for many a wild story in that region of shadows; and the spectre is known at all the country firesides, by the name of the Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow.
<p/>It is remarkable that the visionary propensity I have mentioned is not confined to the native inhabitants of the valley, but is unconsciously imbibed by every one who resides there for a time.
<p/>However wide awake they may have been before they entered that sleepy region, they are sure, in a little time, to inhale the witching influence of the air, and begin to grow imaginative, to dream dreams, and see apparitions.
<p/>I mention this peaceful spot with all possible laud, for it is in such little retired Dutch valleys, found here and there embosomed in the great State of New York, that population, manners, and customs remain fixed, while the great torrent of migration and improvement, which is making such incessant changes in other parts of this restless country, sweeps by them unobserved.
<p/>They are like those little nooks of still water, which border a rapid stream, where we may see the straw and bubble riding quietly at anchor, or slowly revolving in their mimic harbor, undisturbed by the rush of the passing current.
<p/>Though many years have elapsed since I trod the drowsy shades of Sleepy Hollow, yet I question whether I should not still find the same trees and the same families vegetating in its sheltered bosom.
<p/>In this by-place of nature there abode, in a remote period of American history, that is to say, some thirty years since, a worthy wight of the name of Ichabod Crane, who sojourned, or, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) expressed it, <div class="bookquote">``tarried,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in Sleepy Hollow, for the purpose of instructing the children of the vicinity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) was a native of Connecticut, a State which supplies the Union with pioneers for the mind as well as for the forest, and sends forth yearly its legions of frontier woodmen and country schoolmasters.
<p/>CASTLE OF INDOLENCE. A drowsy, dreamy influence seems to hang over the land, and to pervade the very atmosphere. The cognomen of Crane was not inapplicable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) person.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) was tall, but exceedingly lank, with narrow shoulders, long arms and legs, hands that dangled a mile out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) sleeves, feet that might have served for shovels, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) whole frame most loosely hung together.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) head was small, and flat at top, with huge ears, large green glassy eyes, and a long snipe nose, so that it looked like a weather-cock perched upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) spindle neck to tell which way the wind blew.
<p/>To see him (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) striding along the profile of a hill on a windy day, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) clothes bagging and fluttering about him (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>), one might have mistaken him (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) for the genius of famine descending upon the earth, or some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>scarecrow</b></font>) schoolhouse was a low building of one large room, rudely constructed of logs; the windows partly glazed, and partly patched with leaves of old copybooks.
<p/>It was most ingeniously secured at vacant hours, by a withe twisted in the handle of the door, and stakes set against the window shutters; so that though a thief might get in with perfect ease, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) would find some embarrassment in getting out,--an idea most probably borrowed by the architect, Yost Van Houten, from the mystery of an eelpot.
<p/>The schoolhouse stood in a rather lonely but pleasant situation, just at the foot of a woody hill, with a brook running close by, and a formidable birch-tree growing at one end of it.
<p/>From hence the low murmur of his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) pupils' voices, conning over their lessons, might be heard in a drowsy summer's day, like the hum of a beehive; interrupted now and then by the authoritative voice of the master, in the tone of menace or command, or, peradventure, by the appalling sound of the birch, as he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) urged some tardy loiterer along the flowery path of knowledge.
<p/>Truth to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a conscientious man, and ever bore in mind the golden maxim, <div class="bookquote">``Spare the rod and spoil the child.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Truth a man</b></font>)</div><p/>I would not have it imagined, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was one of those cruel potentates of the school who joy in the smart of their subjects; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) administered justice with discrimination rather than severity; taking the burden off the backs of the weak, and laying it on those of the strong.
<p/>Your mere puny stripling, that winced at the least flourish of the rod, was passed by with indulgence; but the claims of justice were satisfied by inflicting a double portion on some little tough wrong-headed, broad-skirted Dutch urchin, who sulked and swelled and grew dogged and sullen beneath the birch.
<p/>All this he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``doing his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) duty by their parents;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) never inflicted a chastisement without following it by the assurance, so consolatory to the smarting urchin, that ``he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would remember it and thank him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) for it the longest day he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had to live.
<p/>When school hours were over, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was even the companion and playmate of the larger boys; and on holiday afternoons would convoy some of the smaller ones home, who happened to have pretty sisters, or good housewives for mothers, noted for the comforts of the cupboard.
<p/>The revenue arising from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) school was small, and would have been scarcely sufficient to furnish him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) with daily bread, for he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a huge feeder, and, though lank, had the dilating powers of an anaconda; but to help out his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) maintenance, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was, according to country custom in those parts, boarded and lodged at the houses of the farmers whose children he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) instructed.
<p/>With these he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lived successively a week at a time, thus going the rounds of the neighborhood, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) worldly effects tied up in a cotton handkerchief.
<p/>That all this might not be too onerous on the purses of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) rustic patrons, who are apt to consider the costs of schooling a grievous burden, and schoolmasters as mere drones, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had various ways of rendering himself both useful and agreeable.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) assisted the farmers occasionally in the lighter labors of their farms, helped to make hay, mended the fences, took the horses to water, drove the cows from pasture, and cut wood for the winter fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) laid aside, too, all the dominant dignity and absolute sway with which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lorded it in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) little empire, the school, and became wonderfully gentle and ingratiating.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) found favor in the eyes of the mothers by petting the children, particularly the youngest; and like the lion bold, which whilom so magnanimously the lamb did hold, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would sit with a child on one knee, and rock a cradle with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) foot for whole hours together.
<p/>In addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) other vocations, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was the singing-master of the neighborhood, and picked up many bright shillings by instructing the young folks in psalmody.
<p/>It was a matter of no little vanity to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) on Sundays, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) station in front of the church gallery, with a band of chosen singers; where, in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) completely carried away the palm from the parson.
<p/>Certain it is, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) voice resounded far above all the rest of the congregation; and there are peculiar quavers still to be heard in that church, and which may even be heard half a mile off, quite to the opposite side of the millpond, on a still Sunday morning, which are said to be legitimately descended from the nose of Ichabod Crane.
<p/>Thus, by divers little makeshifts, in that ingenious way which is commonly denominated <div class="bookquote">``by hook and by crook,''  (<font color='red'><b>divers</b></font>)</div>the worthy pedagogue got on tolerably enough, and was thought, by all who understood nothing of the labor of headwork, to have a wonderfully easy life of it.
<p/>The schoolmaster is generally a man of some importance in the female circle of a rural neighborhood; being considered a kind of idle, gentlemanlike personage, of vastly superior taste and accomplishments to the rough country swains, and, indeed, inferior in learning only to the parson.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>parson</b></font>) appearance, therefore, is apt to occasion some little stir at the tea-table of a farmhouse, and the addition of a supernumerary dish of cakes or sweetmeats, or, peradventure, the parade of a silver teapot.
<p/>Ichabod Crane's scholars certainly were not spoiled. '' Indeed, it behooved him (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) to keep on good terms with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) pupils. Our man of letters, therefore, was peculiarly happy in the smiles of all the country damsels.
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) would figure among them in the churchyard, between services on Sundays; gathering grapes for them from the wild vines that overran the surrounding trees; reciting for their amusement all the epitaphs on the tombstones; or sauntering, with a whole bevy of them, along the banks of the adjacent millpond; while the more bashful country bumpkins hung sheepishly back, envying his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) superior elegance and address.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) half-itinerant life, also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) was a kind of travelling gazette, carrying the whole budget of local gossip from house to house, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) appearance was always greeted with satisfaction.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) was, moreover, esteemed by the women as a man of great erudition, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had read several books quite through, and was a perfect master of Cotton Mather's <div class="bookquote">``History of New England Witchcraft,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cotton Mather</b></font>)</div>in which, by the way, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) most firmly and potently believed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) appetite for the marvellous, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) powers of digesting it, were equally extraordinary; and both had been increased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) residence in this spell-bound region.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) was, in fact, an odd mixture of small shrewdness and simple credulity. No tale was too gross or monstrous for his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) capacious swallow.
<p/>It was often his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) delight, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) school was dismissed in the afternoon, to stretch himself on the rich bed of clover bordering the little brook that whimpered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) schoolhouse, and there con over old Mather's direful tales, until the gathering dusk of evening made the printed page a mere mist before his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) wended his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) way by swamp and stream and awful woodland, to the farmhouse where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) happened to be quartered, every sound of nature, at that witching hour, fluttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) excited imagination,--the
<p/>moan of the whip-poor-will from the hillside, the boding cry of the tree toad, that harbinger of storm, the dreary hooting of the screech owl, or the sudden rustling in the thicket of birds frightened from their roost.
<p/>The fireflies, too, which sparkled most vividly in the darkest places, now and then startled him (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>), as one of uncommon brightness would stream across his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) path; and if, by chance, a huge blockhead of a beetle came winging his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) blundering flight against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>), the poor varlet was ready to give up the ghost, with the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) was struck with a witch's token.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) only resource on such occasions, either to drown thought or drive away evil spirits, was to sing psalm tunes and the good people of Sleepy Hollow, as they sat by their doors of an evening, were often filled with awe at hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) nasal melody, <div class="bookquote">``in linked sweetness long drawn out,''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>floating from the distant hill, or along the dusky road.
<p/>Another of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mather</b></font>) sources of fearful pleasure was to pass long winter evenings with the old Dutch wives, as they sat spinning by the fire, with a row of apples roasting and spluttering along the hearth, and listen to their marvellous tales of ghosts and goblins, and haunted fields, and haunted brooks, and haunted bridges, and haunted houses, and particularly of the headless horseman, or Galloping Hessian of the Hollow, as they sometimes called him (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) would delight them equally by his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) anecdotes of witchcraft, and of the direful omens and portentous sights and sounds in the air, which prevailed in the earlier times of Connecticut; and would frighten them woefully with speculations upon comets and shooting stars; and with the alarming fact that the world did absolutely turn round, and that they were half the time topsy-turvy!
<p/>But if there was a pleasure in all this, while snugly cuddling in the chimney corner of a chamber that was all of a ruddy glow from the crackling wood fire, and where, of course, no spectre dared to show its face, it was dearly purchased by the terrors of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) subsequent walk homewards.
<p/>With what wistful look did he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eye every trembling ray of light streaming across the waste fields from some distant window!
<p/>What fearful shapes and shadows beset his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) path, amidst the dim and ghastly glare of a snowy night! How often was he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) appalled by some shrub covered with snow, which, like a sheeted spectre, beset his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) very path!
<p/>How often did he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) shrink with curdling awe at the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own steps on the frosty crust beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) feet; and dread to look over his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) shoulder, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) should behold some uncouth being tramping close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)!
<p/>And how often was he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) thrown into complete dismay by some rushing blast, howling among the trees, in the idea that it was the Galloping Hessian on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) nightly scourings!
<p/>All these, however, were mere terrors of the night, phantoms of the mind that walk in darkness; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had seen many spectres in his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) time, and been more than once beset by Satan in divers shapes, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) lonely perambulations, yet daylight put an end to all these evils; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) would have passed a pleasant life of it, in despite of the Devil and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) works, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) path had not been crossed by a being that causes more perplexity to mortal man than ghosts, goblins, and the whole race of witches put together, and that was--a woman.
<p/>Among the musical disciples who assembled, one evening in each week, to receive his (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) instructions in psalmody, was Katrina Van Tassel, the daughter and only child of a substantial Dutch farmer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was a blooming lass of fresh eighteen; plump as a partridge; ripe and melting and rosy-cheeked as one of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father's peaches, and universally famed, not merely for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) beauty, but her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) vast expectations.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was withal a little of a coquette, as might be perceived even in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) dress, which was a mixture of ancient and modern fashions, as most suited to set off her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) charms.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wore the ornaments of pure yellow gold, which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) great-great-grandmother had brought over from Saardam; the tempting stomacher of the olden time, and withal a provokingly short petticoat, to display the prettiest foot and ankle in the country round.
<p/>Ichabod Crane had a soft and foolish heart towards the sex; and it is not to be wondered at that so tempting a morsel soon found favor in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) eyes, more especially after he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) had visited her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) paternal mansion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) seldom, it is true, sent either his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) eyes or his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) thoughts beyond the boundaries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) own farm; but within those everything was snug, happy and well-conditioned.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) was satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) wealth, but not proud of it; and piqued himself upon the hearty abundance, rather than the style in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) lived.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) stronghold was situated on the banks of the Hudson, in one of those green, sheltered, fertile nooks in which the Dutch farmers are so fond of nestling.
<p/>A great elm tree spread its broad branches over it, at the foot of which bubbled up a spring of the softest and sweetest water, in a little well formed of a barrel; and then stole sparkling away through the grass, to a neighboring brook, that babbled along among alders and dwarf willows.
<p/>Hard by the farmhouse was a vast barn, that might have served for a church; every window and crevice of which seemed bursting forth with the treasures of the farm; the flail was busily resounding within it from morning to night; swallows and martins skimmed twittering about the eaves; and rows of pigeons, some with one eye turned up, as if watching the weather, some with their heads under their wings or buried in their bosoms, and others swelling, and cooing, and bowing about their dames, were enjoying the sunshine on the roof.
<p/>Sleek unwieldy porkers were grunting in the repose and abundance of their pens, from whence sallied forth, now and then, troops of sucking pigs, as if to snuff the air.
<p/>A stately squadron of snowy geese were riding in an adjoining pond, convoying whole fleets of ducks; regiments of turkeys were gobbling through the farmyard, and Guinea fowls fretting about it, like ill-tempered housewives, with their peevish, discontented cry.
<p/>Before the barn door strutted the gallant cock, that pattern of a husband, a warrior and a fine gentleman, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) burnished wings and crowing in the pride and gladness of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) heart,--sometimes tearing up the earth with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feet, and then generously calling his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ever-hungry family of wives and children to enjoy the rich morsel which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had discovered.
<p/>Old Baltus Van Tassel was a perfect picture of a thriving, contented, liberal-hearted farmer. The pedagogue's mouth watered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) looked upon this sumptuous promise of luxurious winter fare.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) devouring mind's eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) pictured to himself every roasting-pig running about with a pudding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) belly, and an apple in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) mouth; the pigeons were snugly put to bed in a comfortable pie, and tucked in with a coverlet of crust; the geese were swimming in their own gravy; and the ducks pairing cosily in dishes, like snug married couples, with a decent competency of onion sauce.
<p/>but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) beheld daintily trussed up, with its gizzard under its wing, and, peradventure, a necklace of savory sausages; and even bright chanticleer himself lay sprawling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) back, in a side dish, with uplifted claws, as if craving that quarter which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) chivalrous spirit disdained to ask while living.
<p/>As the enraptured Ichabod fancied all this, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) rolled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) great green eyes over the fat meadow lands, the rich fields of wheat, of rye, of buckwheat, and Indian corn, and the orchards burdened with ruddy fruit, which surrounded the warm tenement of Van Tassel, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) heart yearned after the damsel who was to inherit these domains, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) imagination expanded with the idea, how they might be readily turned into cash, and the money invested in immense tracts of wild land, and shingle palaces in the wilderness.
<p/>Nay, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) busy fancy already realized his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) hopes, and presented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) the blooming Katrina, with a whole family of children, mounted on the top of a wagon loaded with household trumpery, with pots and kettles dangling beneath; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) beheld himself bestriding a pacing mare, with a colt at her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) heels, setting out for Kentucky, Tennessee,--or
<p/>In the porkers he (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) saw carved out the future sleek side of bacon, and juicy relishing ham; not a turkey the Lord knows where!
<p/>It was one of those spacious farmhouses, with high-ridged but lowly sloping roofs, built in the style handed down from the first Dutch settlers; the low projecting eaves forming a piazza along the front, capable of being closed up in bad weather.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) entered the house, the conquest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) heart was complete. Under this were hung flails, harness, various utensils of husbandry, and nets for fishing in the neighboring river.
<p/>Benches were built along the sides for summer use; and a great spinning-wheel at one end, and a churn at the other, showed the various uses to which this important porch might be devoted.
<p/>From this piazza the wondering Ichabod entered the hall, which formed the centre of the mansion, and the place of usual residence.
<p/>In one corner stood a huge bag of wool, ready to be spun; in another, a quantity of linsey-woolsey just from the loom; ears of Indian corn, and strings of dried apples and peaches, hung in gay festoons along the walls, mingled with the gaud of red peppers; and a door left ajar gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) a peep into the best parlor, where the claw-footed chairs and dark mahogany tables shone like mirrors;
<p/>andirons, with their accompanying shovel and tongs, glistened from their covert of asparagus tops; mock-oranges and conch-shells decorated the mantelpiece; strings of various-colored birds eggs were suspended above it; a great ostrich egg was hung from the centre of the room, and a corner cupboard, knowingly left open, displayed immense treasures of old silver and well-mended china.
<p/>From the moment Ichabod laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) eyes upon these regions of delight, the peace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) mind was at an end, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) only study was how to gain the affections of the peerless daughter of Van Tassel.
<p/>In this enterprise, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) had more real difficulties than generally fell to the lot of a knight-errant of yore, who seldom had anything but giants, enchanters, fiery dragons, and such like easily conquered adversaries, to contend with and had to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) way merely through gates of iron and brass, and walls of adamant to the castle keep, where the lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) heart was confined; all which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) achieved as easily as a man would carve his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) way to the centre of a Christmas pie; and then the lady gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand as a matter of course.
<p/>Ichabod, on the contrary, had to win his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) way to the heart of a country coquette, beset with a labyrinth of whims and caprices, which were forever presenting new difficulties and impediments; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) had to encounter a host of fearful adversaries of real flesh and blood, the numerous rustic admirers, who beset every portal to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart, keeping a watchful and angry eye upon each other, but ready to fly out in the common cause against any new competitor.
<p/>Among these, the most formidable was a burly, roaring, roystering blade, of the name of Abraham, or, according to the Dutch abbreviation, Brom Van Brunt, the hero of the country round, which rang with his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) feats of strength and hardihood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) was broad-shouldered and double-jointed, with short curly black hair, and a bluff but not unpleasant countenance, having a mingled air of fun and arrogance.
<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) Herculean frame and great powers of limb he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) had received the nickname of BROM BONES, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) was universally known.
<p/>Here rows of resplendent pewter, ranged on a long dresser, dazzled his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) was famed for great knowledge and skill in horsemanship, being as dexterous on horseback as a Tartar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) was foremost at all races and cock fights; and, with the ascendancy which bodily strength always acquires in rustic life, was the umpire in all disputes, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) hat on one side, and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) decisions with an air and tone that admitted of no gainsay or appeal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) was always ready for either a fight or a frolic; but had more mischief than ill-will in his (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) composition; and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) overbearing roughness, there was a strong dash of waggish good humor at bottom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) had three or four boon companions, who regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) as their model, and at the head of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) scoured the country, attending every scene of feud or merriment for miles round.
<p/>In cold weather he (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) was distinguished by a fur cap, surmounted with a flaunting fox's tail; and when the folks at a country gathering descried this well-known crest at a distance, whisking about among a squad of hard riders, they always stood by for a squall.
<p/>Sometimes his (<font color='blue'><b>umpire</b></font>) crew would be heard dashing along past the farmhouses at midnight, with whoop and halloo, like a troop of Don Cossacks; and the old dames, startled out of their sleep, would listen for a moment till the hurry-scurry had clattered by, and then exclaim, <div class="bookquote">``Ay, there goes Brom Bones and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) gang!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the dames</b></font>)</div><p/>The neighbors looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) with a mixture of awe, admiration, and good-will; and, when any madcap prank or rustic brawl occurred in the vicinity, always shook their heads, and warranted Brom Bones was at the bottom of it.
<p/>This rantipole hero had for some time singled out the blooming Katrina for the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) uncouth gallantries, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) amorous toyings were something like the gentle caresses and endearments of a bear, yet it was whispered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) did not altogether discourage his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) hopes.
<p/>Certain it is, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) advances were signals for rival candidates to retire, who felt no inclination to cross a lion in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) amours; insomuch, that when his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) horse was seen tied to Van Tassel's paling, on a Sunday night, a sure sign that his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) master was courting, or, as it is termed, <div class="bookquote">``sparking,''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>within, all other suitors passed by in despair, and carried the war into other quarters.
<p/>Such was the formidable rival with whom Ichabod Crane had to contend, and, considering all things, a stouter man than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have shrunk from the competition, and a wiser man would have despaired.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, however, a happy mixture of pliability and perseverance in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nature; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in form and spirit like a supple-jack--yielding, but tough
<p/>; though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never broke; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowed beneath the slightest pressure, yet, the moment it was away--jerk!--he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) was as erect, and carried his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) head as high as ever.
<p/>To have taken the field openly against his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) rival would have been madness; for he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) was not a man to be thwarted in his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) amours, any more than that stormy lover, Achilles.
<p/>Under cover of his (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) character of singing-master, he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) made frequent visits at the farmhouse; not that he (<font color='blue'><b>jerk</b></font>) had anything to apprehend from the meddlesome interference of parents, which is so often a stumbling-block in the path of lovers.
<p/>Balt Van Tassel was an easy indulgent soul; he (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) daughter better even than his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) pipe, and, like a reasonable man and an excellent father, let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) have her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) way in everything.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) notable little wife, too, had enough to do to attend to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) housekeeping and manage her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) poultry; for, as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sagely observed, ducks and geese are foolish things, and must be looked after, but girls can take care of themselves.
<p/>Thus, while the busy dame bustled about the house, or plied her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) spinning-wheel at one end of the piazza, honest Balt would sit smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) evening pipe at the other, watching the achievements of a little wooden warrior, who, armed with a sword in each hand, was most valiantly fighting the wind on the pinnacle of the barn.
<p/>In the mean time, Ichabod would carry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) suit with the daughter by the side of the spring under the great elm, or sauntering along in the twilight, that hour so favorable to the lover's eloquence.
<p/>Ichabod, therefore, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) advances in a quiet and gently insinuating manner. I profess not to know how women's hearts are wooed and won.
<p/>Some seem to have but one vulnerable point, or door of access; while others have a thousand avenues, and may be captured in a thousand different ways.
<p/>It is a great triumph of skill to gain the former, but a still greater proof of generalship to maintain possession of the latter, for man must battle for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortress at every door and window.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who wins a thousand common hearts is therefore entitled to some renown; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who keeps undisputed sway over the heart of a coquette is indeed a hero.
<p/>Certain it is, this was not the case with the redoubtable Brom Bones; and from the moment Ichabod Crane made his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) advances
<p/>, the interests of the former evidently declined: his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) horse was no longer seen tied to the palings on Sunday nights, and a deadly feud gradually arose between him (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) and the preceptor of Sleepy Hollow.
<p/>Brom, who had a degree of rough chivalry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) nature, would fain have carried matters to open warfare and have settled their pretensions to the lady, according to the mode of those most concise and simple reasoners, the knights-errant of yore,--by single combat; but Ichabod was too conscious of the superior might of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) adversary to enter the lists against him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) had overheard a boast of Bones, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">``double the schoolmaster up, and lay him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) on a shelf of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) own schoolhouse;''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) was too wary to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) an opportunity.
<p/>There was something extremely provoking in this obstinately pacific system; it left Brom no alternative but to draw upon the funds of rustic waggery in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) disposition, and to play off boorish practical jokes upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) rival.
<p/>To me they have always been matters of riddle and admiration. Ichabod became the object of whimsical persecution to Bones and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) gang of rough riders.
<p/>They harried his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) hitherto peaceful domains; smoked out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) singing school by stopping up the chimney; broke into the schoolhouse at night, in spite of its formidable fastenings of withe and window stakes, and turned everything topsy-turvy, so that the poor schoolmaster began to think all the witches in the country held their meetings there.
<p/>But what was still more annoying, Brom took all opportunities of turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Brom</b></font>) into ridicule in presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brom</b></font>) mistress, and had a scoundrel dog whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Brom</b></font>) taught to whine in the most ludicrous manner, and introduced as a rival of Ichabod's, to instruct her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) in psalmody.
<p/>In this way matters went on for some time, without producing any material effect on the relative situations of the contending powers.
<p/>On a fine autumnal afternoon, Ichabod, in pensive mood, sat enthroned on the lofty stool from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) usually watched all the concerns of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) little literary realm.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) hand he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) swayed a ferule, that sceptre of despotic power; the birch of justice reposed on three nails behind the throne, a constant terror to evil doers, while on the desk before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) might be seen sundry contraband articles and prohibited weapons, detected upon the persons of idle urchins, such as half-munched apples, popguns, whirligigs, fly-cages, and whole legions of rampant little paper gamecocks.
<p/>Apparently there had been some appalling act of justice recently inflicted, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) scholars were all busily intent upon their books, or slyly whispering behind them with one eye kept upon the master; and a kind of buzzing stillness reigned throughout the schoolroom.
<p/>It was suddenly interrupted by the appearance of a negro in tow-cloth jacket and trowsers, a round-crowned fragment of a hat, like the cap of Mercury, and mounted on the back of a ragged, wild, half-broken colt, which he (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) managed with a rope by way of halter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>colt</b></font>) came clattering up to the school door with an invitation to Ichabod to attend a merry-making or <div class="bookquote">``quilting frolic,''  (<font color='red'><b>Ichabod/Ichabod Crane/Crane</b></font>)</div>to be held that evening at Mynheer Van Tassel's; and having delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Van</b></font>) message with that air of importance, and effort at fine language, which a negro is apt to display on petty embassies of the kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) dashed over the brook, and was seen scampering away up the hollow, full of the importance and hurry of his (<font color='blue'><b>negro</b></font>) mission.
<p/>The scholars were hurried through their lessons without stopping at trifles; those who were nimble skipped over half with impunity, and those who were tardy had a smart application now and then in the rear, to quicken their speed or help them over a tall word.
<p/>Books were flung aside without being put away on the shelves, inkstands were overturned, benches thrown down, and the whole school was turned loose an hour before the usual time, bursting forth like a legion of young imps, yelping and racketing about the green in joy at their early emancipation.
<p/>The gallant Ichabod now spent at least an extra half hour at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) toilet, brushing and furbishing up his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) best, and indeed only suit of rusty black, and arranging his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) locks by a bit of broken looking-glass that hung up in the schoolhouse.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) might make his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) appearance before his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) mistress in the true style of a cavalier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) borrowed a horse from the farmer with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) was domiciliated, a choleric old Dutchman of the name of Hans Van Ripper, and, thus gallantly mounted, issued forth like a knight-errant in quest of adventures.
<p/>But it is meet I should, in the true spirit of romantic story, give some account of the looks and equipments of my hero and his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) steed.
<p/>All was now bustle and hubbub in the late quiet schoolroom. The animal he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) bestrode was a broken-down plow-horse, that had outlived almost everything but its viciousness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was gaunt and shagged, with a ewe neck, and a head like a hammer; his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) rusty mane and tail were tangled and knotted with burs; one eye had lost its pupil, and was glaring and spectral, but the other had the gleam of a genuine devil in it.
<p/>Still he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) must have had fire and mettle in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) day, if we may judge from the name he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) bore of Gunpowder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had, in fact, been a favorite steed of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) master's, the choleric Van Ripper, who was a furious rider, and had infused, very probably, some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) own spirit into the animal; for, old and broken-down as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) looked, there was more of the lurking devil in him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) than in any young filly in the country.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) rode with short stirrups, which brought his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knees nearly up to the pommel of the saddle; his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) sharp elbows stuck out like grasshoppers'; he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) carried his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) whip perpendicularly in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hand, like a sceptre, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) horse jogged on, the motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) arms was not unlike the flapping of a pair of wings.
<p/>A small wool hat rested on the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) nose, for so his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) scanty strip of forehead might be called, and the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) black coat fluttered out almost to the horses tail.
<p/>Such was the appearance of Ichabod and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) steed as they shambled out of the gate of Hans Van Ripper, and it was altogether such an apparition as is seldom to be met with in broad daylight.
<p/>It was, as I have said, a fine autumnal day; the sky was clear and serene, and nature wore that rich and golden livery which we always associate with the idea of abundance.
<p/>The forests had put on their sober brown and yellow, while some trees of the tenderer kind had been nipped by the frosts into brilliant dyes of orange, purple, and scarlet.
<p/>Streaming files of wild ducks began to make their appearance high in the air; the bark of the squirrel might be heard from the groves of beech and hickory-nuts, and the pensive whistle of the quail at intervals from the neighboring stubble field.
<p/>In the fullness of their revelry, they fluttered, chirping and frolicking from bush to bush, and tree to tree, capricious from the very profusion and variety around them.
<p/>There was the honest cock robin, the favorite game of stripling sportsmen, with its loud querulous note; and the twittering blackbirds flying in sable clouds; and the golden-winged woodpecker with his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) crimson crest, his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) broad black gorget, and splendid plumage; and the cedar bird, with its red-tipt wings and yellow-tipt tail and its little monteiro cap of feathers; and the blue jay, that noisy coxcomb, in his (<font color='blue'><b>robin</b></font>) gay light blue coat and white underclothes, screaming and chattering, nodding and bobbing and bowing, and pretending to be on good terms with every songster of the grove.
<p/>As Ichabod jogged slowly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) way, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) eye, ever open to every symptom of culinary abundance, ranged with delight over the treasures of jolly autumn.
<p/>On all sides he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) beheld vast store of apples; some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees; some gathered into baskets and barrels for the market; others heaped up in rich piles for the cider-press.
<p/>Farther on he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from their leafy coverts, and holding out the promise of cakes and hasty-pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies; and anon
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) passed the fragrant buckwheat fields breathing the odor of the beehive, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) mind of dainty slapjacks, well buttered, and garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel.
<p/>Thus feeding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) mind with many sweet thoughts and <div class="bookquote">``sugared suppositions,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) journeyed along the sides of a range of hills which look out upon some of the goodliest scenes of the mighty Hudson.
<p/>Ichabod was a suitable figure for such a steed. The small birds were taking their farewell banquets. The sun gradually wheeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) broad disk down in the west.
<p/>The wide bosom of the Tappan Zee lay motionless and glassy, excepting that here and there a gentle undulation waved and prolonged the blue shadow of the distant mountain.
<p/>The horizon was of a fine golden tint, changing gradually into a pure apple green, and from that into the deep blue of the mid-heaven.
<p/>A slanting ray lingered on the woody crests of the precipices that overhung some parts of the river, giving greater depth to the dark gray and purple of their rocky sides.
<p/>A sloop was loitering in the distance, dropping slowly down with the tide, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) sail hanging uselessly against the mast; and as the reflection of the sky gleamed along the still water, it seemed as if the vessel was suspended in the air.
<p/>It was toward evening that Ichabod arrived at the castle of the Heer Van Tassel, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) found thronged with the pride and flower of the adjacent country.
<p/>A few amber clouds floated in the sky, without a breath of air to move them. Old farmers, a spare leathern-faced race, in homespun coats and breeches, blue stockings, huge shoes, and magnificent pewter buckles.
<p/>Their brisk, withered little dames, in close-crimped caps, long-waisted short gowns, homespun petticoats, with scissors and pincushions, and gay calico pockets hanging on the outside.
<p/>Buxom lasses, almost as antiquated as their mothers, excepting where a straw hat, a fine ribbon, or perhaps a white frock, gave symptoms of city innovation.
<p/>The sons, in short square-skirted coats, with rows of stupendous brass buttons, and their hair generally queued in the fashion of the times, especially if they could procure an eel-skin for the purpose, it being esteemed throughout the country as a potent nourisher and strengthener of the hair.
<p/>Brom Bones, however, was the hero of the scene, having come to the gathering on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) favorite steed Daredevil, a creature, like himself, full of mettle and mischief, and which no one but himself could manage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) was, in fact, noted for preferring vicious animals, given to all kinds of tricks which kept the rider in constant risk of his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) neck, for he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) held a tractable, well-broken horse as unworthy of a lad of spirit.
<p/>Fain would I pause to dwell upon the world of charms that burst upon the enraptured gaze of my hero, as he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) entered the state parlor of Van Tassel's mansion.
<p/>Not those of the bevy of buxom lasses, with their luxurious display of red and white; but the ample charms of a genuine Dutch country tea-table, in the sumptuous time of autumn.
<p/>There was the doughty doughnut, the tender oly koek, and the crisp and crumbling cruller; sweet cakes and short cakes, ginger cakes and honey cakes, and the whole family of cakes.
<p/>And then there were apple pies, and peach pies, and pumpkin pies; besides slices of ham and smoked beef; and moreover delectable dishes of preserved plums, and peaches, and pears, and quinces; not to mention broiled shad and roasted chickens; together with bowls of milk and cream, all mingled higgledy-piggledy, pretty much as I have enumerated them, with the motherly teapot sending up its clouds of vapor from the midst--Heaven bless the mark!
<p/>I want breath and time to discuss this banquet as it deserves, and am too eager to get on with my story.
<p/>Such heaped up platters of cakes of various and almost indescribable kinds, known only to experienced Dutch housewives! Happily, Ichabod Crane was not in so great a hurry as his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) historian, but did ample justice to every dainty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) was a kind and thankful creature, whose heart dilated in proportion as his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) skin was filled with good cheer, and whose spirits rose with eating, as some men's do with drink.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) could not help, too, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) large eyes round him (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) ate, and chuckling with the possibility that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) might one day be lord of all this scene of almost unimaginable luxury and splendor.
<p/>Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) thought, how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>)'d turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) back upon the old schoolhouse; snap his (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) fingers in the face of Hans Van Ripper, and every other niggardly patron, and kick any itinerant pedagogue out of doors that should dare to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) comrade!
<p/>Old Baltus Van Tassel moved about among his (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) guests with a face dilated with content and good humor, round and jolly as the harvest moon.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tassel</b></font>) hospitable attentions were brief, but expressive, being confined to a shake of the hand, a slap on the shoulder, a loud laugh, and a pressing invitation to <div class="bookquote">``fall to, and help themselves.
<p/>The musician was an old gray-headed negro, who had been the itinerant orchestra of the neighborhood for more than half a century.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And now the sound of the music from the common room, or hall, summoned to the dance. His (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) instrument was as old and battered as himself.
<p/>The greater part of the time he (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) scraped on two or three strings, accompanying every movement of the bow with a motion of the head; bowing almost to the ground, and stamping with his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) foot whenever a fresh couple were to start.
<p/>Not a limb, not a fibre about him (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) was idle; and to have seen his (<font color='blue'><b>musician</b></font>) loosely hung frame in full motion, and clattering about the room, you would have thought
<p/>Ichabod prided himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) dancing as much as upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) vocal powers. St. Vitus himself, that blessed patron of the dance, was figuring before you in person.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) was the admiration of all the negroes; who, having gathered, of all ages and sizes, from the farm and the neighborhood, stood forming a pyramid of shining black faces at every door and window, gazing with delight at the scene, rolling their white eyeballs, and showing grinning rows of ivory from ear to ear.
<p/>The lady of his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) heart was his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) partner in the dance, and smiling graciously in reply to all his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) amorous oglings; while Brom Bones, sorely smitten with love and jealousy, sat brooding by himself in one corner.
<p/>When the dance was at an end, Ichabod was attracted to a knot of the sager folks, who, with Old Van Tassel, sat smoking at one end of the piazza, gossiping over former times, and drawing out long stories about the war.
<p/>This neighborhood, at the time of which I am speaking, was one of those highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men.
<p/>The British and American line had run near it during the war; it had, therefore, been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees, cowboys, and all kinds of border chivalry.
<p/>Just sufficient time had elapsed to enable each storyteller to dress up his (<font color='blue'><b>storyteller</b></font>) tale with a little becoming fiction, and, in the indistinctness of his (<font color='blue'><b>storyteller</b></font>) recollection, to make himself the hero of every exploit.
<p/>There was the story of Doffue Martling, a large blue-bearded Dutchman, who had nearly taken a British frigate with an old iron nine-pounder from a mud breastwork, only that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchman</b></font>) gun burst at the sixth discharge.
<p/>And there was an old gentleman who shall be nameless, being too rich a mynheer to be lightly mentioned, who, in the battle of White Plains, being an excellent master of defence, parried a musket-ball with a small sword, insomuch that he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) absolutely felt it whiz round the blade, and glance off at the hilt; in proof of which he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) was ready at any time to show the sword, with the hilt a little bent.
<p/>There were several more that had been equally great in the field, not one of whom but was persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had a considerable hand in bringing the war to a happy termination.
<p/>How could the flogger of urchins be otherwise than animated and joyous? But all these were nothing to the tales of ghosts and apparitions that succeeded.
<p/>Local tales and superstitions thrive best in these sheltered, long-settled retreats; but are trampled under foot by the shifting throng that forms the population of most of our country places.
<p/>Besides, there is no encouragement for ghosts in most of our villages, for they have scarcely had time to finish their first nap and turn themselves in their graves, before their surviving friends have travelled away from the neighborhood; so that when they turn out at night to walk their rounds, they have no acquaintance left to call upon.
<p/>The neighborhood is rich in legendary treasures of the kind. This is perhaps the reason why we so seldom hear of ghosts except in our long-established Dutch communities.
<p/>The immediate cause, however, of the prevalence of supernatural stories in these parts, was doubtless owing to the vicinity of Sleepy Hollow.
<p/>There was a contagion in the very air that blew from that haunted region; it breathed forth an atmosphere of dreams and fancies infecting all the land.
<p/>Several of the Sleepy Hollow people were present at Van Tassel's, and, as usual, were doling out their wild and wonderful legends.
<p/>Many dismal tales were told about funeral trains, and mourning cries and wailings heard and seen about the great tree where the unfortunate Major Andr√© was taken, and which stood in the neighborhood.
<p/>Some mention was made also of the woman in white, that haunted the dark glen at Raven Rock, and was often heard to shriek on winter nights before a storm, having perished there in the snow.
<p/>The chief part of the stories, however, turned upon the favorite spectre of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman, who had been heard several times of late, patrolling the country; and, it was said, tethered his (<font color='blue'><b>Horseman</b></font>) horse nightly among the graves in the churchyard.
<p/>It stands on a knoll, surrounded by locust-trees and lofty elms, from among which its decent, whitewashed walls shine modestly forth, like Christian purity beaming through the shades of retirement.
<p/>A gentle slope descends from it to a silver sheet of water, bordered by high trees, between which, peeps may be caught at the blue hills of the Hudson.
<p/>To look upon its grass-grown yard, where the sunbeams seem to sleep so quietly, one would think that there at least the dead might rest in peace.
<p/>On one side of the church extends a wide woody dell, along which raves a large brook among broken rocks and trunks of fallen trees.
<p/>Over a deep black part of the stream, not far from the church, was formerly thrown a wooden bridge; the road that led to it, and the bridge itself, were thickly shaded by overhanging trees, which cast a gloom about it, even in the daytime; but occasioned a fearful darkness at night.
<p/>The sequestered situation of this church seems always to have made it a favorite haunt of troubled spirits. Such was one of the favorite haunts of the Headless Horseman, and the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Horseman</b></font>) was most frequently encountered.
<p/>The tale was told of old Brouwer, a most heretical disbeliever in ghosts, how he (<font color='blue'><b>Brouwer</b></font>) met the Horseman returning from his (<font color='blue'><b>Horseman</b></font>) foray into Sleepy Hollow, and was obliged to get up behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Horseman</b></font>); how they galloped over bush and brake, over hill and swamp, until they reached the bridge; when the Horseman suddenly turned into a skeleton, threw old Brouwer into the brook, and sprang away over the tree-tops with a clap of thunder.
<p/>This story was immediately matched by a thrice marvellous adventure of Brom Bones, who made light of the Galloping Hessian as an arrant jockey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) affirmed that on returning one night from the neighboring village of Sing Sing, he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) had been overtaken by this midnight trooper; that he (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) had offered to race with him (<font color='blue'><b>jockey</b></font>) for a bowl of punch, and should have won it too, for Daredevil beat the goblin horse all hollow, but just as they came to the church bridge, the Hessian bolted, and vanished in a flash of fire.
<p/>All these tales, told in that drowsy undertone with which men talk in the dark, the countenances of the listeners only now and then receiving a casual gleam from the glare of a pipe, sank deep in the mind of Ichabod.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) repaid them in kind with large extracts from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) invaluable author, Cotton Mather, and added many marvellous events that had taken place in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) native State of Connecticut, and fearful sights which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) had seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) nightly walks about Sleepy Hollow.
<p/>The old farmers gathered together their families in their wagons, and were heard for some time rattling along the hollow roads, and over the distant hills.
<p/>Some of the damsels mounted on pillions behind their favorite swains, and their light-hearted laughter, mingling with the clatter of hoofs, echoed along the silent woodlands, sounding fainter and fainter, until they gradually died away,--and the late scene of noise and frolic was all silent and deserted.
<p/>Ichabod only lingered behind, according to the custom of country lovers, to have a t√™te-√†-t√™te with the heiress; fully convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) was now on the high road to success.
<p/>The revel now gradually broke up. What passed at this interview I will not pretend to say, for in fact I do not know.
<p/>Something, however, I fear me, must have gone wrong, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) certainly sallied forth, after no very great interval, with an air quite desolate and chapfallen.
<p/>Oh, these women! these women! Could that girl have been playing off any of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) coquettish tricks? Was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) encouragement of the poor pedagogue all a mere sham to secure her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) conquest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) rival?
<p/>Let it suffice to say, Ichabod stole forth with the air of one who had been sacking a henroost, rather than a fair lady's heart.
<p/>Without looking to the right or left to notice the scene of rural wealth, on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) had so often gloated, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) went straight to the stable, and with several hearty cuffs and kicks roused his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) steed most uncourteously from the comfortable quarters in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) was soundly sleeping, dreaming of mountains of corn and oats, and whole valleys of timothy and clover.
<p/>It was the very witching time of night that Ichabod, heavy-hearted and crestfallen, pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) travels homewards, along the sides of the lofty hills which rise above Tarry Town, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) had traversed so cheerily in the afternoon.
<p/>Far below him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) the Tappan Zee spread its dusky and indistinct waste of waters, with here and there the tall mast of a sloop, riding quietly at anchor under the land.
<p/>In the dead hush of midnight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) could even hear the barking of the watchdog from the opposite shore of the Hudson; but it was so vague and faint as only to give an idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) distance from this faithful companion of man.
<p/>Now and then, too, the long-drawn crowing of a cock, accidentally awakened, would sound far, far off, from some farmhouse away among the hills--but it was like a dreaming sound in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) ear.
<p/>No signs of life occurred near him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>), but occasionally the melancholy chirp of a cricket, or perhaps the guttural twang of a bullfrog from a neighboring marsh, as if sleeping uncomfortably and turning suddenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) bed.
<p/>Heaven only knows, not I! The hour was as dismal as himself. All the stories of ghosts and goblins that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) had heard in the afternoon now came crowding upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) recollection.
<p/>The night grew darker and darker; the stars seemed to sink deeper in the sky, and driving clouds occasionally hid them from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) sight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) had never felt so lonely and dismal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) was, moreover, approaching the very place where many of the scenes of the ghost stories had been laid.
<p/>In the centre of the road stood an enormous tulip-tree, which towered like a giant above all the other trees of the neighborhood, and formed a kind of landmark.
<p/>Its limbs were gnarled and fantastic, large enough to form trunks for ordinary trees, twisting down almost to the earth, and rising again into the air.
<p/>It was connected with the tragical story of the unfortunate Andr√©, who had been taken prisoner hard by; and was universally known by the name of Major Andr√©'s tree.
<p/>The common people regarded it with a mixture of respect and superstition, partly out of sympathy for the fate of its ill-starred namesake, and partly from the tales of strange sights, and doleful lamentations, told concerning it.
<p/>As Ichabod approached this fearful tree, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) began to whistle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) whistle was answered; it was but a blast sweeping sharply through the dry branches.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) approached a little nearer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) saw something white, hanging in the midst of the tree: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) paused and ceased whistling but, on looking more narrowly, perceived that it was a place where the tree had been scathed by lightning, and the white wood laid bare.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) heard a groan--his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) teeth chattered, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) knees smote against the saddle: it was but the rubbing of one huge bough upon another, as they were swayed about by the breeze.
<p/>About two hundred yards from the tree, a small brook crossed the road, and ran into a marshy and thickly-wooded glen, known by the name of Wiley's Swamp.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wiley</b></font>) passed the tree in safety, but new perils lay before him (<font color='blue'><b>Wiley</b></font>). A few rough logs, laid side by side, served for a bridge over this stream.
<p/>On that side of the road where the brook entered the wood, a group of oaks and chestnuts, matted thick with wild grape-vines, threw a cavernous gloom over it.
<p/>It was at this identical spot that the unfortunate Andr√© was captured, and under the covert of those chestnuts and vines were the sturdy yeomen concealed who surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Andr√©</b></font>).
<p/>This has ever since been considered a haunted stream, and fearful are the feelings of the schoolboy who has to pass it alone after dark.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) approached the stream, his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) heart began to thump; he (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) summoned up, however, all his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) resolution, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>schoolboy</b></font>) horse half a score of kicks in the ribs, and attempted to dash briskly across the bridge; but instead of starting forward, the perverse old animal made a lateral movement, and ran broadside against the fence.
<p/>Ichabod, whose fears increased with the delay, jerked the reins on the other side, and kicked lustily with the contrary foot: it was all in vain; his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) steed started, it is true, but it was only to plunge to the opposite side of the road into a thicket of brambles and alder bushes.
<p/>The schoolmaster now bestowed both whip and heel upon the starveling ribs of old Gunpowder, who dashed forward, snuffling and snorting, but came to a stand just by the bridge, with a suddenness that had nearly sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) rider sprawling over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) head.
<p/>To pass this bridge was the severest trial. Just at this moment a plashy tramp by the side of the bridge caught the sensitive ear of Ichabod.
<p/>In the dark shadow of the grove, on the margin of the brook, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) beheld something huge, misshapen and towering. It stirred not, but seemed gathered up in the gloom, like some gigantic monster ready to spring upon the traveller.
<p/>To turn and fly was now too late; and besides, what chance was there of escaping ghost or goblin, if such it was, which could ride upon the wings of the wind?
<p/>The hair of the affrighted pedagogue rose upon his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) head with terror. What was to be done? Summoning up, therefore, a show of courage, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) demanded in stammering accents, <div class="bookquote">``Who are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Once more he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) cudgelled the sides of the inflexible Gunpowder, and, shutting his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) eyes, broke forth with involuntary fervor into a psalm tune.
<p/>Just then the shadowy object of alarm put itself in motion, and with a scramble and a bound stood at once in the middle of the road.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) received no reply. He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) demand in a still more agitated voice. Still there was no answer. Though the night was dark and dismal, yet the form of the unknown might now in some degree be ascertained.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) made no offer of molestation or sociability, but kept aloof on one side of the road, jogging along on the blind side of old Gunpowder, who had now got over his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) fright and waywardness.
<p/>Ichabod, who had no relish for this strange midnight companion, and bethought himself of the adventure of Brom Bones with the Galloping Hessian, now quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) steed in hopes of leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) behind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) appeared to be a horseman of large dimensions, and mounted on a black horse of powerful frame. The stranger, however, quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) horse to an equal pace.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) heart began to sink within him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) endeavored to resume his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) psalm tune, but his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) parched tongue clove to the roof of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mouth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could not utter a stave.
<p/>Ichabod pulled up, and fell into a walk, thinking to lag behind,--the other did the same. There was something in the moody and dogged silence of this pertinacious companion that was mysterious and appalling.
<p/>On mounting a rising ground, which brought the figure of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) fellow-traveller in relief against the sky, gigantic in height, and muffled in a cloak, Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) was headless!--but
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) horror was still more increased on observing that the head, which should have rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) shoulders, was carried before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) on the pommel of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) saddle!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) terror rose to desperation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) rained a shower of kicks and blows upon Gunpowder, hoping by a sudden movement to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) companion the slip; but the spectre started full jump with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>).
<p/>It was soon fearfully accounted for. Away, then, they dashed through thick and thin; stones flying and sparks flashing at every bound.
<p/>Ichabod's flimsy garments fluttered in the air, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) long lank body away over his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) horse's head, in the eagerness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) flight.
<p/>They had now reached the road which turns off to Sleepy Hollow; but Gunpowder, who seemed possessed with a demon, instead of keeping up it, made an opposite turn, and plunged headlong downhill to the left.
<p/>This road leads through a sandy hollow shaded by trees for about a quarter of a mile, where it crosses the bridge famous in goblin story; and just beyond swells the green knoll on which stands the whitewashed church.
<p/>As yet the panic of the steed had given his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) unskilful rider an apparent advantage in the chase, but just as he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) had got half way through the hollow, the girths of the saddle gave way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) felt it slipping from under him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) seized it by the pommel, and endeavored to hold it firm, but in vain; and had just time to save himself by clasping old Gunpowder round the neck, when the saddle fell to the earth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) heard it trampled under foot by his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) pursuer.
<p/>For a moment the terror of Hans Van Ripper's wrath passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) mind,--for it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) Sunday saddle; but this was no time for petty fears; the goblin was hard on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) haunches; and -LRB-unskilful rider that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) was!-RRB-
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) had much ado to maintain his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) seat; sometimes slipping on one side, sometimes on another, and sometimes jolted on the high ridge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) horse's backbone, with a violence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) verily feared would cleave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) asunder.
<p/>An opening in the trees now cheered him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) with the hopes that the church bridge was at hand. The wavering reflection of a silver star in the bosom of the brook told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) was not mistaken.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) saw the walls of the church dimly glaring under the trees beyond. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) recollected the place where Brom Bones's ghostly competitor had disappeared.
<p/>Just then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) heard the black steed panting and blowing close behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) even fancied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) hot breath.
<p/>Another convulsive kick in the ribs, and old Gunpowder sprang upon the bridge; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) thundered over the resounding planks; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) gained the opposite side; and now Ichabod cast a look behind to see if his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) pursuer should vanish, according to rule, in a flash of fire and brimstone.
<p/>Just then he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) saw the goblin rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) stirrups, and in the very act of hurling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) head at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>).
<p/>'' If I can but reach that bridge,'' thought Ichabod, <div class="bookquote">``I am safe. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Ichabod/Ichabod Crane/Crane</b></font>)</div>Ichabod endeavored to dodge the horrible missile, but too late.
<p/>It encountered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) cranium with a tremendous crash,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) was tumbled headlong into the dust, and Gunpowder, the black steed, and the goblin rider, passed by like a whirlwind.
<p/>The next morning the old horse was found without his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) saddle, and with the bridle under his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) feet, soberly cropping the grass at his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) master's gate.
<p/>Ichabod did not make his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) appearance at breakfast; dinner-hour came, but no Ichabod. The boys assembled at the schoolhouse, and strolled idly about the banks of the brook; but no schoolmaster.
<p/>Hans Van Ripper now began to feel some uneasiness about the fate of poor Ichabod, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) saddle. An inquiry was set on foot, and after diligent investigation they came upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) traces.
<p/>In one part of the road leading to the church was found the saddle trampled in the dirt; the tracks of horses' hoofs deeply dented in the road, and evidently at furious speed, were traced to the bridge, beyond which, on the bank of a broad part of the brook, where the water ran deep and black, was found the hat of the unfortunate Ichabod, and close beside it a shattered pumpkin.
<p/>The brook was searched, but the body of the schoolmaster was not to be discovered. Hans Van Ripper as executor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) estate, examined the bundle which contained all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) worldly effects.
<p/>They consisted of two shirts and a half; two stocks for the neck; a pair or two of worsted stockings; an old pair of corduroy small-clothes; a rusty razor; a book of psalm tunes full of dog's-ears; and a broken pitch-pipe.
<p/>As to the books and furniture of the schoolhouse, they belonged to the community, excepting Cotton Mather's <div class="bookquote">``History of Witchcraft,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cotton Mather</b></font>)</div>a <div class="bookquote">``New England Almanac,''  (<font color='red'><b>Cotton Mather</b></font>)</div>and a book of dreams and fortune-telling; in which last was a sheet of foolscap much scribbled and blotted in several fruitless attempts to make a copy of verses in honor of the heiress of Van Tassel.
<p/>These magic books and the poetic scrawl were forthwith consigned to the flames by Hans Van Ripper; who, from that time forward, determined to send his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) children no more to school, observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) never knew any good come of this same reading and writing.
<p/>Whatever money the schoolmaster possessed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) had received his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) quarter's pay but a day or two before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) must have had about his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) person at the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) disappearance.
<p/>Knots of gazers and gossips were collected in the churchyard, at the bridge, and at the spot where the hat and pumpkin had been found.
<p/>The stories of Brouwer, of Bones, and a whole budget of others were called to mind; and when they had diligently considered them all, and compared them with the symptoms of the present case, they shook their heads, and came to the conclusion that Ichabod had been carried off by the Galloping Hessian.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) was a bachelor, and in nobody's debt, nobody troubled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) head any more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>); the school was removed to a different quarter of the hollow, and another pedagogue reigned in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) stead.
<p/>It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crane</b></font>) had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the heiress; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ripper</b></font>) quarters to a distant part of the country; had kept school and studied law at the same time; had been admitted to the bar; turned politician; electioneered; written for the newspapers; and finally had been made a justice of the Ten Pound Court.
<p/>Brom Bones, too, who, shortly after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bones</b></font>) rival's disappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin; which led some to suspect that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) knew more about the matter than he (<font color='blue'><b>Ichabod</b></font>) chose to tell.
<p/>The old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these matters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told about the neighborhood round the winter evening fire.
<p/>The bridge became more than ever an object of superstitious awe; and that may be the reason why the road has been altered of late years, so as to approach the church by the border of the millpond.
<p/>The schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to decay, and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue and the plowboy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening, has often fancied his (<font color='blue'><b>ghost</b></font>) voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.
<p/>The mysterious event caused much speculation at the church on the following Sunday. POSTSCRIPT. FOUND IN THE HANDWRITING OF MR. KNICKERBOCKER.
<p/>The preceding tale is given almost in the precise words in which I heard it related at a Corporation meeting at the ancient city of Manhattoes, at which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers.
<p/>The narrator was a pleasant, shabby, gentlemanly old fellow, in pepper-and-salt clothes, with a sadly humourous face, and one whom I strongly suspected of being poor--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) made such efforts to be entertaining.
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) story was concluded, there was much laughter and approbation, particularly from two or three deputy aldermen, who had been asleep the greater part of the time.
<p/>There was, however, one tall, dry-looking old gentleman, with beetling eyebrows, who maintained a grave and rather severe face throughout, now and then folding his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms, inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) head, and looking down upon the floor, as if turning a doubt over in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was one of your wary men, who never laugh but upon good grounds--when they have reason and law on their side.
<p/>When the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided, and silence was restored, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) leaned one arm on the elbow of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chair, and sticking the other akimbo, demanded, with a slight, but exceedingly sage motion of the head, and contraction of the brow, what was the moral of the story, and what it went to prove?
<p/>The story-teller, who was just putting a glass of wine to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lips, as a refreshment after his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) toils, paused for a moment, looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inquirer with an air of infinite deference, and, lowering the glass slowly to the table, observed that the story was intended most logically to prove-- ``That there is no situation in life but has its advantages and pleasures--provided we will but take a joke as we find it: ``That, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to have rough riding of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state.
<p/>The cautious old gentleman knit his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brows tenfold closer after this explanation, being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism, while, methought, the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with something of a triumphant leer.
<p/>At length he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) observed that all this was very well, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thought the story a little on the extravagant--there were one or two points on which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) doubts.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the story-teller</b></font>)</div>'' Faith, sir,'' replied the story-teller, <div class="bookquote">``as to that matter, I don't believe one-half of it myself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the story-teller</b></font>)</div>D. K. THE END.
