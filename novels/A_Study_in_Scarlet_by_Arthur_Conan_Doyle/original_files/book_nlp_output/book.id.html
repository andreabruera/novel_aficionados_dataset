<p/>Part II, The Country of the Saints, deals much with the Mormon Church. A STUDY IN SCARLET. PART I. -LRB- Being a reprint from the reminiscences of JOHN H. WATSON, M.D., late of the Army Medical Department. -RRB-
<p/>IN the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the course prescribed for surgeons in the army.
<p/>-LSB-2-RSB- CHAPTER I. MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES. Having completed my studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon.
<p/>The regiment was stationed in India at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had broken out.
<p/>On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's country.
<p/>I followed, however, with many other officers who were in the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new duties.
<p/>I was removed from my brigade and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal battle of Maiwand.
<p/>The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had nothing but misfortune and disaster. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery.
<p/>I should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to the British lines.
<p/>Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to the base hospital at Peshawar.
<p/>Here I rallied, and had already improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric fever, that curse of our Indian possessions.
<p/>For months my life was despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to England.
<p/>I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship <div class="bookquote">``Orontes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.
<p/>I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day will permit a man to be.
<p/>Under such circumstances, I naturally gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained.
<p/>There I stayed for some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless, meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably more freely than I ought.
<p/>So alarming did the state of my finances become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a complete alteration in my style of living.
<p/>Choosing the latter alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive domicile.
<p/>On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and turning round
<p/>The sight of a friendly face in the great wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man.
<p/>In old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now I hailed him (<font color='blue'><b>crony</b></font>) with enthusiasm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>crony</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>crony</b></font>) turn, appeared to be delighted to see me.
<p/>In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>crony</b></font>) to lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a hansom.
<p/>I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser under me at Barts. '' Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) asked in undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets. '' You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut.
<p/>I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded it by the time that we reached our destination.
<p/>'' '' Poor devil! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) said, commiseratingly, after he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had listened to my misfortunes. '' What are you up to now?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Looking for lodgings.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LSB-3-RSB- I answered. '' Trying to solve the problem as to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable price.''
<p/>'' That's a strange thing,'' remarked my companion; <div class="bookquote">``you are the second man to-day that has used that expression to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And who was the first? '' I asked. '' A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the hospital.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was bemoaning himself this morning because he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could not get someone to go halves with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in some nice rooms which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had found, and which were too much for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) purse.''
<p/>I cried, ``if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) really wants someone to share the rooms and the expense, I am the very man for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By Jove! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I should prefer having a partner to being alone.'' Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) wine-glass.
<p/>'' You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``perhaps you would not care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) as a constant companion.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why, what is there against him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is a little queer in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science.
<p/>As far as I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is a decent fellow enough.'' <div class="bookquote">``A medical student, I suppose? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``No--I have no idea what he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) intends to go in for.
<p/>I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is well up in anatomy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I know, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has never taken out any systematic medical classes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) has amassed a lot of out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) professors.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) can be communicative enough when the fancy seizes him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did you never ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was going in for? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' <div class="bookquote">``I should like to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<p/>'' If I am to lodge with anyone, I should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong enough yet to stand much noise or excitement.
<p/>I had enough of both in Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How could I meet this friend of yours?''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is sure to be at the laboratory,'' returned my companion. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) either avoids the place for weeks, or else he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) works there from morning to night.
<p/>If you like, we shall drive round together after luncheon.'' <div class="bookquote">``Certainly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other channels.
<p/>As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn, Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.
<p/>You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I know nothing more of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) than I have learned from meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) occasionally in the laboratory.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You proposed this arrangement, so you must not hold me responsible.'' '' If we don't get on it will be easy to part company,'' I answered.
<p/>It seems to me, Stamford,'' I added, looking hard at my companion, <div class="bookquote">``that you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>Is this fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed about it.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is not easy to express the inexpressible,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) answered with a laugh.
<p/>I could imagine his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) giving a friend a little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in order to have an accurate idea of the effects.
<p/>'' Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it approaches to cold-bloodedness. To do him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) justice, I think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) would take it himself with the same readiness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge.'' '' Very right too. '' '' Yes, but it may be pushed to excess.
<p/>When it comes to beating the subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking rather a bizarre shape.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Beating the subjects!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) at it with my own eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And yet you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) is not a medical student?'' '' No. Heaven knows what the objects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) studies are.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) spoke, we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door, which opened into a wing of the great hospital.
<p/>It was familiar ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors.
<p/>But here we are, and you must form your own impressions about him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>). '' Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.
<p/>This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles. Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts, test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering flames.
<p/>There was only one student in the room, who was bending over a distant table absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) work. At the sound of our steps he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) glanced round and sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) feet with a cry of pleasure.
<p/>'' I've found it! I've found it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) shouted to my companion, running towards us with a test-tube in his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' I have found a re-agent which is precipitated by hoemoglobin, -LSB-4-RSB- and by nothing else. '' Had he (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) discovered a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his (<font color='blue'><b>student</b></font>) features.
<p/>'' Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,'' said Stamford, introducing us. '' How are you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength for which I should hardly have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) credit.
<p/>'' You have been in Afghanistan, I perceive. '' <div class="bookquote">``How on earth did you know that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked in astonishment.
<p/>'' Never mind,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>), chuckling to himself. '' The question now is about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this discovery of mine?''
<p/>'' It is interesting, chemically, no doubt,'' I answered, <div class="bookquote">``but practically-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized me by the coat-sleeve in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been working.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us have some fresh blood,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, digging a long bodkin into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood in a chemical pipette.
<p/>Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains. Come over here now!'' '' Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a litre of water.
<p/>You perceive that the resulting mixture has the appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than one in a million.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw into the vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a transparent fluid.
<p/>In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the glass jar.
<p/>I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to obtain the characteristic reaction. '' '' Ha! ha!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) cried, clapping his (<font color='blue'><b>Ha</b></font>) hands, and looking as delighted as a child with a new toy.
<p/>'' What do you think of that?'' '' It seems to be a very delicate test,'' I remarked. '' Beautiful! beautiful!
<p/>The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles. The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old.
<p/>Had this test been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes.
<p/>Now, this appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. '' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I murmured. '' Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point.
<p/>A man is suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon them.
<p/>Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many an expert, and why?
<p/>Because there was no reliable test. Now we have the Sherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any difficulty.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes fairly glittered as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) spoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>'' '' You are to be congratulated,'' I remarked, considerably surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) enthusiasm. '' There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bischoff</b></font>) would certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of Montpellier, and Samson of New Orleans.
<p/>I could name a score of cases in which it would have been decisive.'' <div class="bookquote">``You seem to be a walking calendar of crime,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Stamford with a laugh.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very interesting reading it might be made, too,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>remarked Sherlock Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) finger.
<p/>I have to be careful,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) continued, turning to me with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``for I dabble with poisons a good deal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hand as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.
<p/>We came here on business,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said Stamford, sitting down on a high three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) foot.
<p/>'' You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the `Police News of the Past.''' '' '' '' ''
<p/>My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I thought that I had better bring you together.
<p/>'' Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) rooms with me. '' I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``which would suit us down to the ground.
<p/>You don't mind the smell of strong tobacco, I hope?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I always smoke `ship's' myself,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. '' That's good enough.
<p/>I generally have chemicals about, and occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?'' '' By no means. '' <div class="bookquote">``Let me see--what are my other shortcomings.
<p/>I get in the dumps at times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I am sulky when I do that.
<p/>Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right. What have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to know the worst of one another before they begin to live together.
<p/>I keep a bull pup,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed at this cross-examination. '' I have another set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at present.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked, anxiously. '' It depends on the player,'' I answered.
<p/>'' A well-played violin is a treat for the gods--a badly-played one--'' '' Oh, that's all right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cried, with a merry laugh.
<p/>'' I think we may consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to you. '' '' When shall we see them?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered. '' All right--noon exactly,'' said I, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand.
<p/>By the way,'' I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford, <div class="bookquote">``how the deuce did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) know that I had come from Afghanistan?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>We left him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) working among his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chemicals, and we walked together towards my hotel. '' My companion smiled an enigmatical smile.
<p/>'' That's just his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) little peculiarity,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said. '' A good many people have wanted to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) finds things out.''
<p/>'' Oh! a mystery is it? '' I cried, rubbing my hands. '' This is very piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. '
<p/>The proper study of mankind is man,' you know. '' <div class="bookquote">``You must study him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Stamford said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bade me good-bye.
<p/>'' You'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learns more about you than you about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Good-bye.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably interested in my new acquaintance.
<p/>CHAPTER II. THE SCIENCE OF DEDUCTION. WE met next day as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No. 221B,
<p/>They consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows.
<p/>So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.
<p/>That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and portmanteaus.
<p/>-LSB-5-RSB- Baker Street, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>) had spoken at our meeting. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking and laying out our property to the best advantage.
<p/>That done, we gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our new surroundings. Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with.
<p/>It was rare for him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) to be up after ten at night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had invariably breakfasted and gone out before I rose in the morning.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) day at the chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) into the lowest portions of the City.
<p/>Nothing could exceed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) energy when the working fit was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>); but now and again a reaction would seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), and for days on end he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) would lie upon the sofa in the sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning to night.
<p/>On these occasions I have noticed such a dreamy, vacant expression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes, that I might have suspected him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) of being addicted to the use of some narcotic, had not the temperance and cleanliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) whole life forbidden such a notion.
<p/>As the weeks went by, my interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) and my curiosity as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) aims in life, gradually deepened and increased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was quiet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) ways, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) habits were regular. His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) very person and appearance were such as to strike the attention of the most casual observer.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes were sharp and piercing, save during those intervals of torpor to which I have alluded; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) thin, hawk-like nose gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) whole expression an air of alertness and decision.
<p/>In height he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was rather over six feet, and so excessively lean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) seemed to be considerably taller. His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) chin, too, had the prominence and squareness which mark the man of determination.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hands were invariably blotted with ink and stained with chemicals, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was possessed of extraordinary delicacy of touch, as I frequently had occasion to observe when I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) manipulating his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) fragile philosophical instruments.
<p/>The reader may set me down as a hopeless busybody, when I confess how much this man stimulated my curiosity, and how often I endeavoured to break through the reticence which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) showed on all that concerned himself.
<p/>Before pronouncing judgment, however, be it remembered, how objectless was my life, and how little there was to engage my attention.
<p/>My health forbade me from venturing out unless the weather was exceptionally genial, and I had no friends who would call upon me and break the monotony of my daily existence.
<p/>Under these circumstances, I eagerly hailed the little mystery which hung around my companion, and spent much of my time in endeavouring to unravel it.
<p/>Neither did he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) appear to have pursued any course of reading which might fit him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) for a degree in science or any other recognized portal which would give him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) an entrance into the learned world.
<p/>Yet his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) zeal for certain studies was remarkable, and within eccentric limits his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) knowledge was so extraordinarily ample and minute that his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) observations have fairly astounded me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was not studying medicine. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had himself, in reply to a question, confirmed Stamford's opinion upon that point. Surely no man would work so hard or attain such precise information unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some definite end in view.
<p/>Desultory readers are seldom remarkable for the exactness of their learning. No man burdens his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind with small matters unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has some very good reason for doing so.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ignorance was as remarkable as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knowledge. Of contemporary literature, philosophy and politics he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to know next to nothing.
<p/>My surprise reached a climax, however, when I found incidentally that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ignorant of the Copernican Theory and of the composition of the Solar System.
<p/>That any civilized human being in this nineteenth century should not be aware that the earth travelled round the sun appeared to be to me such an extraordinary fact that I could hardly realize it.
<p/>Upon my quoting Thomas Carlyle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) inquired in the naivest way who he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might be and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had done. ''
<p/>You appear to be astonished,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) said, smiling at my expression of surprise. '' Now that I do know it I shall do my best to forget it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) explained, <div class="bookquote">``I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose.
<p/>A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things so that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has a difficulty in laying his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hands upon it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) will have nothing but the tools which may help him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) in doing his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) work, but of these he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To forget it!'' Now the skilful workman is very careful indeed as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) takes into his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) brain-attic. It is a mistake to think that that little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent.
<p/>Depend upon it there comes a time when for every addition of knowledge you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.''
<p/>'' But the Solar System! '' I protested. '' What the deuce is it to me? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>) interrupted impatiently; <div class="bookquote">``you say that we go round the sun.
<p/>If we went round the moon it would not make a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I was on the point of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>) what that work might be, but something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>) manner showed me that the question would be an unwelcome one.
<p/>I pondered over our short conversation, however, and endeavoured to draw my deductions from it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>) would acquire no knowledge which did not bear upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>) object.
<p/>I enumerated in my own mind all the various points upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>) had shown me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>) was exceptionally well-informed.
<p/>Therefore all the knowledge which he (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>) possessed was such as would be useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Solar</b></font>). I even took a pencil and jotted them down.
<p/>I could not help smiling at the document when I had completed it. It ran in this way-- SHERLOCK HOLMES--his (<font color='blue'><b>HOLMES</b></font>) limits.
<p/>1. Knowledge of Literature.--Nil. 2. Philosophy.--Nil. 3. Astronomy.--Nil. 4. Politics.--Feeble. 5. Botany.--Variable. Well up in belladonna, opium, and poisons generally. Knows nothing of practical gardening.
<p/>After walks has shown me splashes upon his (<font color='blue'><b>HOLMES</b></font>) trousers, and told me by their colour and consistence in what part of London he (<font color='blue'><b>HOLMES</b></font>) had received them.
<p/>6. Geology.--Practical, but limited. Tells at a glance different soils from each other. 7. Chemistry.--Profound. 8. Anatomy.--Accurate, but unsystematic. 9. Sensational Literature.--Immense.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>HOLMES</b></font>) appears to know every detail of every horror perpetrated in the century. 10. Plays the violin well. 11. Is an expert singlestick player, boxer, and swordsman.
<p/>12. Has a good practical knowledge of British law. When I had got so far in my list I threw it into the fire in despair.
<p/>If I can only find what the fellow is driving at by reconciling all these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them all,'' I said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``I may as well give up the attempt at once.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I see that I have alluded above to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) powers upon the violin. These were very remarkable, but as eccentric as all his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) other accomplishments.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could play pieces, and difficult pieces, I knew well, because at my request he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has played me some of Mendelssohn's Lieder, and other favourites.
<p/>Leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) arm-chair of an evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would close his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knee.
<p/>When left to himself, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized air. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy.
<p/>Clearly they reflected the thoughts which possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), but whether the music aided those thoughts, or whether the playing was simply the result of a whim or fancy was more than I could determine.
<p/>I might have rebelled against these exasperating solos had it not been that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) usually terminated them by playing in quick succession a whole series of my favourite airs as a slight compensation for the trial upon my patience.
<p/>During the first week or so we had no callers, and I had begun to think that my companion was as friendless a man as I was myself.
<p/>Occasionally they were fantastic and cheerful. Presently, however, I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had many acquaintances, and those in the most different classes of society.
<p/>There was one little sallow rat-faced, dark-eyed fellow who was introduced to me as Mr. Lestrade, and who came three or four times in a single week.
<p/>The same afternoon brought a grey-headed, seedy visitor, looking like a Jew pedlar, who appeared to me to be much excited, and who was closely followed by a slip-shod elderly woman.
<p/>On another occasion an old white-haired gentleman had an interview with my companion; and on another a railway porter in his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) velveteen uniform.
<p/>When any of these nondescript individuals put in an appearance, Sherlock Holmes used to beg for the use of the sitting-room, and I would retire to my bed-room.
<p/>One morning a young girl called, fashionably dressed, and stayed for half an hour or more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) always apologized to me for putting me to this inconvenience.
<p/>'' I have to use this room as a place of business,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and these people are my clients. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Again I had an opportunity of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) a point blank question, and again my delicacy prevented me from forcing another man to confide in me.
<p/>I imagined at the time that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had some strong reason for not alluding to it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon dispelled the idea by coming round to the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own accord.
<p/>It was upon the 4th of March, as I have good reason to remember, that I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes had not yet finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) breakfast.
<p/>The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared.
<p/>Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) toast.
<p/>One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.
<p/>Its somewhat ambitious title was <div class="bookquote">``The Book of Life,''  (<font color='red'><b>an man</b></font>)</div>and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.
<p/>With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity.
<p/>The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man's inmost thoughts.
<p/>The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. Deceit, according to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis.
<p/>So startling would his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had arrived at them they might well consider him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a necromancer.
<p/>From a drop of water,'' said the writer, <div class="bookquote">``a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other.
<p/>So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it.
<p/>Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it.
<p/>Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems.
<p/>Let him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) belongs.
<p/>Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for.
<p/>By a man's finger nails, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat-sleeve, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boot, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trouser knees, by the callosities of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forefinger and thumb, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expression, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shirt cuffs--by each of these things a man's calling is plainly revealed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the writer</b></font>)</div>That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What ineffable twaddle! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table, <div class="bookquote">``I never read such rubbish in my life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What is it?'' asked Sherlock Holmes. '' Why, this article,'' I said, pointing at it with my egg spoon as I sat down to my breakfast.
<p/>'' I see that you have read it since you have marked it. I don't deny that it is smartly written.
<p/>It is evidently the theory of some arm-chair lounger who evolves all these neat little paradoxes in the seclusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) own study.
<p/>I should like to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) clapped down in a third class carriage on the Underground, and asked to give the trades of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) fellow-travellers.
<p/>It irritates me though. It is not practical. I would lay a thousand to one against him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``You would lose your money,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Sherlock Holmes remarked calmly.
<p/>'' As for the article I wrote it myself.'' <div class="bookquote">``You!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, I have a turn both for observation and for deduction.
<p/>The theories which I have expressed there, and which appear to you to be so chimerical are really extremely practical--so practical that I depend upon them for my bread and cheese.''
<p/>'' And how? '' I asked involuntarily. '' Well, I have a trade of my own. I suppose I am the only one in the world.
<p/>I'm a consulting detective, if you can understand what that is. Here in London we have lots of Government detectives and lots of private ones.
<p/>They lay all the evidence before me, and I am generally able, by the help of my knowledge of the history of crime, to set them straight.
<p/>There is a strong family resemblance about misdeeds, and if you have all the details of a thousand at your finger ends, it is odd if you can't unravel the thousand and first.
<p/>When these fellows are at fault they come to me, and I manage to put them on the right scent. Lestrade is a well-known detective.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) got himself into a fog recently over a forgery case, and that was what brought him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) here.'' '' And these other people?''
<p/>'' They are mostly sent on by private inquiry agencies. They are all people who are in trouble about something, and want a little enlightening.
<p/>But do you mean to say,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``that without leaving your room you can unravel some knot which other men can make nothing of, although they have seen every detail for themselves?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I listen to their story, they listen to my comments, and then I pocket my fee.'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way.
<p/>Now and again a case turns up which is a little more complex. Then I have to bustle about and see things with my own eyes.
<p/>You see I have a lot of special knowledge which I apply to the problem, and which facilitates matters wonderfully. Those rules of deduction laid down in that article which aroused your scorn, are invaluable to me in practical work.
<p/>Observation with me is second nature. You appeared to be surprised when I told you, on our first meeting, that you had come from Afghanistan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>From long habit the train of thoughts ran so swiftly through my mind, that I arrived at the conclusion without being conscious of intermediate steps.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You were told, no doubt. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Nothing of the sort. I knew you came from Afghanistan. There were such steps, however.
<p/>The train of reasoning ran, `Here is a gentleman of a medical type, but with the air of a military man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has just come from the tropics, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face is dark, and that is not the natural tint of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skin, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wrists are fair.
<p/>Clearly an army doctor, then. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has undergone hardship and sickness, as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) haggard face says clearly. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left arm has been injured.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) holds it in a stiff and unnatural manner. Where in the tropics could an English army doctor have seen much hardship and got his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) arm wounded?
<p/>Clearly in Afghanistan.' The whole train of thought did not occupy a second. I then remarked that you came from Afghanistan, and you were astonished.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is simple enough as you explain it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, smiling. '' You remind me of Edgar Allen Poe's Dupin. I had no idea that such individuals did exist outside of stories.
<p/>'' Sherlock Holmes rose and lit his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pipe. '' No doubt you think that you are complimenting me in comparing me to Dupin,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) observed.
<p/>That trick of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) of breaking in on his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) friends' thoughts with an apropos remark after a quarter of an hour's silence is really very showy and superficial.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had some analytical genius, no doubt; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was by no means such a phenomenon as Poe appeared to imagine.''
<p/>'' Now, in my opinion, Dupin was a very inferior fellow. <div class="bookquote">``Have you read Gaboriau's works? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Does Lecoq come up to your idea of a detective?
<p/>Lecoq was a miserable bungler,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) said, in an angry voice; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) had only one thing to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>), and that was his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) energy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Sherlock Holmes sniffed sardonically. '' That book made me positively ill. The question was how to identify an unknown prisoner.
<p/>I could have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It might be made a text-book for detectives to teach them what to avoid.
<p/>'' I felt rather indignant at having two characters whom I had admired treated in this cavalier style. I walked over to the window, and stood looking out into the busy street.
<p/>'' This fellow may be very clever,'' I said to myself, <div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is certainly very conceited. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' There are no crimes and no criminals in these days,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, querulously.
<p/>'' What is the use of having brains in our profession. I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous.
<p/>No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done.
<p/>There is no crime to detect, or, at most, some bungling villainy with a motive so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official can see through it.
<p/>And what is the result? '' I was still annoyed at his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) bumptious style of conversation. I thought it best to change the topic.
<p/>I asked, pointing to a stalwart, plainly-dressed individual who was walking slowly down the other side of the street, looking anxiously at the numbers.
<p/>'' I wonder what that fellow is looking for? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had a large blue envelope in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand, and was evidently the bearer of a message.
<p/>'' You mean the retired sergeant of Marines,'' said Sherlock Holmes. '' Brag and bounce!'' thought I to myself. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) knows that I cannot verify his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) guess.
<p/>The thought had hardly passed through my mind when the man whom we were watching caught sight of the number on our door, and ran rapidly across the roadway.
<p/>'' We heard a loud knock, a deep voice below, and heavy steps ascending the stair. '' For Mr. Sherlock Holmes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said, stepping into the room and handing my friend the letter.
<p/>Here was an opportunity of taking the conceit out of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) little thought of this when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) made that random shot.
<p/>'' May I ask, my lad,'' I said, in the blandest voice, <div class="bookquote">``what your trade may be?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Commissionaire, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, gruffly.
<p/>'' Uniform away for repairs.'' '' And you were? '' I asked, with a slightly malicious glance at my companion. ''
<p/>A sergeant, sir, Royal Marine Light Infantry, sir. No answer? Right, sir. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Marine</b></font>) clicked his (<font color='blue'><b>Marine</b></font>) heels together, raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Marine</b></font>) hand in a salute, and was gone.
<p/>THE LAURISTON GARDEN MYSTERY -LSB-6-RSB- I CONFESS that I was considerably startled by this fresh proof of the practical nature of my companion's theories.
<p/>There still remained some lurking suspicion in my mind, however, that the whole thing was a pre-arranged episode, intended to dazzle me, though what earthly object he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could have in taking me in was past my comprehension.
<p/>When I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had finished reading the note, and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eyes had assumed the vacant, lack-lustre expression which showed mental abstraction.
<p/>CHAPTER III. My respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) powers of analysis increased wondrously. '' How in the world did you deduce that? ''
<p/>I asked. '' Deduce what? '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), petulantly. '' Why, that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was a retired sergeant of Marines. '' <div class="bookquote">``I have no time for trifles,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) answered, brusquely; then with a smile, <div class="bookquote">``Excuse my rudeness.
<p/>You broke the thread of my thoughts; but perhaps it is as well. So you actually were not able to see that that man was a sergeant of Marines?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If you were asked to prove that two and two made four, you might find some difficulty, and yet you are quite sure of the fact.
<p/>'' No, indeed.'' <div class="bookquote">``It was easier to know it than to explain why I knew it. Even across the street I could see a great blue anchor tattooed on the back of the fellow's hand.
<p/>That smacked of the sea. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had a military carriage, however, and regulation side whiskers. There we have the marine. He (<font color='blue'><b>marine</b></font>) was a man with some amount of self-importance and a certain air of command.
<p/>A steady, respectable, middle-aged man, too, on the face of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--all facts which led me to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been a sergeant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>You must have observed the way in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head and swung his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cane. <div class="bookquote">``Wonderful! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ejaculated. <div class="bookquote">``Commonplace,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, though I thought from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) expression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was pleased at my evident surprise and admiration.
<p/>'' I said just now that there were no criminals. It appears that I am wrong--look at this!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) threw me over the note which the commissionaire had brought.

(<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It does seem to be a little out of the common,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) remarked, calmly.

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am the most incurably lazy devil that ever stood in shoe leather--that is, when the fit is on me, for I can be spry enough at times.

<p/>That comes of being an unofficial personage.'' '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) begs you to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>).'' '' Yes. However, we may as well go and have a look.
<p/>I shall work it out on my own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) hustled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one.
<p/>Come on!'' '' Get your hat,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) said. '' You wish me to come?'' '' Yes, if you have nothing better to do.
<p/>It was a foggy, cloudy morning, and a dun-coloured veil hung over the house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets beneath.
<p/>My companion was in the best of spirits, and prattled away about Cremona fiddles, and the difference between a Stradivarius and an Amati.
<p/>As for myself, I was silent, for the dull weather and the melancholy business upon which we were engaged, depressed my spirits.
<p/>'' A minute later we were both in a hansom, driving furiously for the Brixton Road. '' You don't seem to give much thought to the matter in hand,'' I said at last, interrupting Holmes' musical disquisition.
<p/>'' No data yet,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) answered. '' It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will have your data soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked, pointing with my finger; <div class="bookquote">``this is the Brixton Road, and that is the house, if I am not very much mistaken.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>We were still a hundred yards or so from it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our journey upon foot.
<p/>'' So it is. Stop, driver, stop! '' Number 3, Lauriston Gardens wore an ill-omened and minatory look. It was one of four which stood back some little way from the street, two being occupied and two empty.
<p/>The latter looked out with three tiers of vacant melancholy windows, which were blank and dreary, save that here and there a
<p/>A small garden sprinkled over with a scattered eruption of sickly plants separated each of these houses from the street, and was traversed by a narrow pathway, yellowish in colour, and consisting apparently of a mixture of clay and of gravel.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To Let''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>card had developed like a cataract upon the bleared panes. The whole place was very sloppy from the rain which had fallen through the night.
<p/>The garden was bounded by a three-foot brick wall with a fringe of wood rails upon the top, and against this wall was leaning a stalwart police constable, surrounded by a small knot of loafers, who craned their necks and strained their eyes in the vain hope of catching some glimpse of the proceedings within.
<p/>I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into the house and plunged into a study of the mystery.
<p/>With an air of nonchalance which, under the circumstances, seemed to me to border upon affectation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) lounged up and down the pavement, and gazed vacantly at the ground, the sky, the opposite houses and the line of railings.
<p/>Having finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) scrutiny, he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) proceeded slowly down the path, or rather down the fringe of grass which flanked the path, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes riveted upon the ground.
<p/>Nothing appeared to be further from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) intention. Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) stopped, and once I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) smile, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) utter an exclamation of satisfaction.
<p/>There were many marks of footsteps upon the wet clayey soil, but since the police had been coming and going over it, I was unable to see how my companion could hope to learn anything from it.
<p/>Still I had had such extraordinary evidence of the quickness of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) perceptive faculties, that I had no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could see a great deal which was hidden from me.
<p/>At the door of the house we were met by a tall, white-faced, wrung my companion's hand with effusion. '' It is indeed kind of you to come,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have had everything left untouched.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Except that! '' my friend answered, pointing at the pathway. '' If a herd of buffaloes had passed along there could not be a greater mess.
<p/>No doubt, however, you had drawn your own conclusions, Gregson, before you permitted this.'' <div class="bookquote">``I have had so much to do inside the house,''  (<font color='red'><b>the detective</b></font>)</div>the detective said evasively.
<p/>'' My colleague, Mr. Lestrade, is here. I had relied upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) to look after this. '' Holmes glanced at me and raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyebrows sardonically.
<p/>With two such men as yourself and Lestrade upon the ground, there will not be much for a third party to find out,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said.
<p/>I think we have done all that can be done,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``it's a queer case though, and I knew your taste for such things.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Gregson rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) hands in a self-satisfied way. '' <div class="bookquote">``You did not come here in a cab?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>asked Sherlock Holmes.
<p/>'' No, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Nor Lestrade?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, sir.'' '' Then let us go and look at the room. '' With which inconsequent remark he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) astonishment.
<p/>A short passage, bare planked and dusty, led to the kitchen and offices. Two doors opened out of it to the left and to the right.
<p/>One of these had obviously been closed for many weeks. The other belonged to the dining-room, which was the apartment in which the mysterious affair had occurred.
<p/>Holmes walked in, and I followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) with that subdued feeling at my heart which the presence of death inspires. It was a large square room, looking all the larger from the absence of all furniture.
<p/>A vulgar flaring paper adorned the walls, but it was blotched in places with mildew, and here and there great strips had become detached and hung down, exposing the yellow plaster beneath.
<p/>Opposite the door was a showy fireplace, surmounted by a mantelpiece of imitation white marble. On one corner of this was stuck the stump of a red wax candle.
<p/>The solitary window was so dirty that the light was hazy and uncertain, giving a dull grey tinge to everything, which was intensified by the thick layer of dust which coated the whole apartment.
<p/>At present my attention was centred upon the single grim motionless figure which lay stretched upon the boards, with vacant sightless eyes staring up at the discoloured ceiling.
<p/>It was that of a man about forty-three or forty-four years of age, middle-sized, broad shouldered, with crisp curling black hair, and a short stubbly beard.
<p/>All these details I observed afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dressed in a heavy broadcloth frock coat and waistcoat, with light-coloured trousers, and immaculate collar and cuffs.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands were clenched and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms thrown abroad, while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lower limbs were interlocked as though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) death struggle had been a grievous one.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rigid face there stood an expression of horror, and as it seemed to me, of hatred, such as I have never seen upon human features.
<p/>This malignant and terrible contortion, combined with the low forehead, blunt nose, and prognathous jaw gave the dead man a singularly simious and ape-like appearance, which was increased by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) writhing, unnatural posture.
<p/>I have seen death in many forms, but never has it appeared to me in a more fearsome aspect than in that dark grimy apartment, which looked out upon one of the main arteries of suburban London.
<p/>A top hat, well brushed and trim, was placed upon the floor beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Lestrade, lean and ferret-like as ever, was standing by the doorway, and greeted my companion and myself.
<p/>'' This case will make a stir, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) remarked. '' It beats anything I have seen, and I am no chicken.
<p/>'' '' There is no clue?'' said Gregson. '' None at all,'' chimed in Lestrade. Sherlock Holmes approached the body, and, kneeling down, examined it intently.
<p/>'' You are sure that there is no wound? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) asked, pointing to numerous gouts and splashes of blood which lay all round.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Positive!''  (<font color='red'><b>both detectives</b></font>)</div>cried both detectives. '' Then, of course, this blood belongs to a second individual---LSB-8-RSB- presumably the murderer, if murder has been committed.
<p/>It reminds me of the circumstances attendant on the death of Van Jansen, in Utrecht, in the year '34. Do you remember the case, Gregson?''
<p/>'' No, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Read it up--you really should. There is nothing new under the sun. It has all been done before.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) nimble fingers were flying here, there, and everywhere, feeling, pressing, unbuttoning, examining, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) eyes wore the same far-away expression which I have already remarked upon.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So swiftly was the examination made, that one would hardly have guessed the minuteness with which it was conducted. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) sniffed the dead man's lips, and then glanced at the soles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) patent leather boots.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) has not been moved at all? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) asked. '' No more than was necessary for the purposes of our examination.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You can take him (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) to the mortuary now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) said. '' There is nothing more to be learned. '' Gregson had a stretcher and four men at hand.
<p/>At his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) call they entered the room, and the stranger was lifted and carried out. As they raised him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), a ring tinkled down and rolled across the floor.
<p/>Lestrade grabbed it up and stared at it with mystified eyes. '' There's been a woman here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) cried. '' It's a woman's wedding-ring.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) held it out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) spoke, upon the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) hand. We all gathered round him (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) and gazed at it.
<p/>There could be no doubt that that circlet of plain gold had once adorned the finger of a bride. '' This complicates matters,'' said Gregson.
<p/>'' Heaven knows, they were complicated enough before.'' '' You're sure it doesn't simplify them?'' observed Holmes. '' There's nothing to be learned by staring at it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We have it all here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregson/TOBIAS GREGSON/Tobias Gregson</b></font>)</div>said Gregson, pointing to a litter of objects upon one of the bottom steps of the stairs.
<p/>What did you find in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) pockets?'' '' A gold watch, No. 97163, by Barraud, of London. Gold Albert chain, very heavy and solid.
<p/>Gold ring, with masonic device. Gold pin--bull-dog's head, with rubies as eyes. Russian leather card-case, with cards of Enoch J. Drebber of Cleveland, corresponding with the E. J. D. upon the linen.
<p/>No purse, but loose money to the extent of seven pounds thirteen. Pocket edition of Boccaccio's `Decameron,' with name of Joseph Stangerson upon the fly-leaf.
<p/>Two letters--one addressed to E. J. Drebber and one to Joseph Stangerson.'' <div class="bookquote">``At what address?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``American Exchange, Strand--to be left till called for.
<p/>They are both from the Guion Steamship Company, and refer to the sailing of their boats from Liverpool. It is clear that this unfortunate man was about to return to New York.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I have had advertisements sent to all the newspapers, and one of my men has gone to the American Exchange, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not returned yet.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Have you made any inquiries as to this man, Stangerson?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did it at once, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregson/TOBIAS GREGSON/Tobias Gregson</b></font>)</div>said Gregson. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Have you sent to Cleveland?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``We telegraphed this morning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did you word your inquiries?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We simply detailed the circumstances, and said that we should be glad of any information which could help us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You did not ask for particulars on any point which appeared to you to be crucial?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I asked about Stangerson.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing else?
<p/>Is there no circumstance on which this whole case appears to hinge? Will you not telegraph again?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have said all I have to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregson/TOBIAS GREGSON/Tobias Gregson</b></font>)</div>said Gregson, in an offended voice.
<p/>Sherlock Holmes chuckled to himself, and appeared to be about to make some remark, when Lestrade, who had been in the front room while we were holding this conversation in the hall, reappeared upon the scene, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) hands in a pompous and self-satisfied manner.
<p/>Mr. Gregson,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) said, ``I have just made a discovery of the highest importance, and one which would have been overlooked had I not made a careful examination of the walls.
<p/>The little man's eyes sparkled as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was evidently in a state of suppressed exultation at having scored a point against his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) colleague.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, bustling back into the room, the atmosphere of which felt clearer since the removal of its ghastly inmate.
<p/>'' '' '' Now, stand there!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) struck a match on his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) boot and held it up against the wall. ''
<p/>Look at that!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) said, triumphantly. I have remarked that the paper had fallen away in parts. In this particular corner of the room a large piece had peeled off, leaving a yellow square of coarse plastering.
<p/>Across this bare space there was scrawled in blood-red letters a single word-- RACHE. '' What do you think of that?'' cried the detective, with the air of a showman exhibiting his (<font color='blue'><b>showman</b></font>) show.
<p/>'' This was overlooked because it was in the darkest corner of the room, and no one thought of looking there.
<p/>The murderer has written it with his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>showman</b></font>) own blood. See this smear where it has trickled down the wall!
<p/>That disposes of the idea of suicide anyhow. Why was that corner chosen to write it on? I will tell you.
<p/>It was lit at the time, and if it was lit this corner would be the brightest instead of the darkest portion of the wall.''
<p/>See that candle on the mantelpiece. '' And what does it mean now that you have found it?'' asked Gregson in a depreciatory voice.
<p/>Why, it means that the writer was going to put the female name Rachel, but was disturbed before he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) had time to finish.
<p/>You mark my words, when this case comes to be cleared up you will find that a woman named Rachel has something to do with it.
<p/>'' Mean? It's all very well for you to laugh, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. You may be very smart and clever, but the old hound is the best, when all is said and done.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I really beg your pardon!''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said my companion, who had ruffled the little man's temper by bursting into an explosion of laughter.
<p/>You certainly have the credit of being the first of us to find this out, and, as you say, it bears every mark of having been written by the other participant in last night's mystery.
<p/>'' '' I have not had time to examine this room yet, but with your permission I shall do so now.
<p/>With these two implements he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) trotted noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally kneeling, and once lying flat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>So engrossed was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) occupation that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to have forgotten our presence, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chattered away to himself under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath the whole time, keeping up a running fire of exclamations, groans, whistles, and little cries suggestive of encouragement and of hope.
<p/>As I watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I was irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it dashes backwards and forwards through the covert, whining in its eagerness, until it comes across the lost scent.
<p/>For twenty minutes or more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) researches, measuring with the most exact care the distance between marks which were entirely invisible to me, and occasionally applying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tape to the walls in an equally incomprehensible manner.
<p/>In one place he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gathered up very carefully a little pile of grey dust from the floor, and packed it away in an envelope.
<p/>Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) examined with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass the word upon the wall, going over every letter of it with the most minute exactness.
<p/>'' As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whipped a tape measure and a large round magnifying glass from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket. This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to be satisfied, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replaced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tape and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>'' They say that genius is an infinite capacity for taking pains,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remarked with a smile. '' It's a very bad definition, but it does apply to detective work.
<p/>They evidently failed to appreciate the fact, which I had begun to realize, that Sherlock Holmes' smallest actions were all directed towards some definite and practical end.
<p/>'' Gregson and Lestrade had watched the manoeuvres -LSB-9-RSB- of their amateur companion with considerable curiosity and some contempt. '' What do you think of it, sir?
<p/>It would be robbing you of the credit of the case if I was to presume to help you,'' remarked my friend.
<p/>'' they both asked. '' '' You are doing so well now that it would be a pity for anyone to interfere.
<p/>If you will let me know how your investigations go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be happy to give you any help I can.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was a world of sarcasm in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke. '' In the meantime I should like to speak to the constable who found the body.
<p/>Can you give me his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) name and address?'' Lestrade glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) note-book. <div class="bookquote">``John Rance,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) said. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) is off duty now.
<p/>You will find him (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) at 46, Audley Court, Kennington Park Gate. '' Holmes took a note of the address. '' Come along, Doctor,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``we shall go and look him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) up.
<p/>I'll tell you one thing which may help you in the case,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) continued, turning to the two detectives. '' There has been murder done, and the murderer was a man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) was more than six feet high, was in the prime of life, had small feet for his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) height, wore coarse, square-toed boots and smoked a Trichinopoly cigar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) came here with his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) victim in a four-wheeled cab, which was drawn by a horse with three old shoes and one new one on his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) off fore leg.
<p/>In all probability the murderer had a florid face, and the finger-nails of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) right hand were remarkably long. These are only a few indications, but they may assist you.
<p/>'' Lestrade and Gregson glanced at each other with an incredulous smile. '' If this man was murdered, how was it done?'' asked the former.
<p/>One other thing, Lestrade,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, turning round at the door: ''`Rache,' is the German for `revenge;' so don't lose your time looking for Miss Rachel.
<p/>'' Poison,'' said Sherlock Holmes curtly, and strode off. '' '' With which Parthian shot he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) walked away, leaving the two rivals open-mouthed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).
<p/>CHAPTER IV. WHAT JOHN RANCE HAD TO TELL. IT was one o'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) dispatched a long telegram.
<p/>There is nothing like first hand evidence,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) remarked; <div class="bookquote">``as a matter of fact, my mind is entirely made up upon the case, but still we may as well learn all that is to be learned.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take us to the address given us by Lestrade. '' <div class="bookquote">``You amaze me, Holmes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Surely you are not as sure as you pretend to be of all those particulars which you gave. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' There's no room for a mistake,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) answered.
<p/>The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb.
<p/>Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night.
<p/>There were the marks of the horse's hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe.
<p/>Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning--I have Gregson's word for that--it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, the height of a man, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stride.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' That seems simple enough,'' said I; <div class="bookquote">``but how about the other man's height?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures.
<p/>I had this fellow's stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation.
<p/>When a man writes on a wall, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) instinct leads him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to write about the level of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground.
<p/>Well, if a man can stride four and a-half feet without the smallest effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can't be quite in the sere and yellow.
<p/>It was child's play.'' <div class="bookquote">``And his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' That was the breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had evidently walked across.
<p/>I am simply applying to ordinary life a few of those precepts of observation and deduction which I advocated in that article.
<p/>Patent-leather boots had gone round, and Square-toes had hopped over. There is no mystery about it at all. Is there anything else that puzzles you?''
<p/>'' The finger nails and the Trichinopoly,'' I suggested. '' The writing on the wall was done with a man's forefinger dipped in blood.
<p/>My glass allowed me to observe that the plaster was slightly scratched in doing it, which would not have been the case if the man's nail had been trimmed.
<p/>I gathered up some scattered ash from the floor. It was dark in colour and flakey--such an ash as is only made by a Trichinopoly.
<p/>I flatter myself that I can distinguish at a glance the ash of any known brand, either of cigar or of tobacco.
<p/>I have made a special study of cigar ashes--in fact, I have written a monograph upon the subject. It is just in such details that the skilled detective differs from the Gregson and Lestrade type.''
<p/>'' And the florid face? '' I asked. '' Ah, that was a more daring shot, though I have no doubt that I was right.
<p/>You must not ask me that at the present state of the affair. '' I passed my hand over my brow.
<p/>'' My head is in a whirl,'' I remarked; <div class="bookquote">``the more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men--if there were two men--into an empty house?
<p/>What has become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from?
<p/>What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman's ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping?
<p/>I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My companion smiled approvingly. '' You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said.
<p/>As to poor Lestrade's discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies.
<p/>'' There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. It was not done by a German.
<p/>Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) part.
<p/>The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel.
<p/>You know a conjuror gets no credit when once he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has explained his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.''
<p/>I shall never do that,'' I answered; <div class="bookquote">``you have brought detection as near an exact science as it ever will be brought in this world.
<p/>I'm not going to tell you much more of the case, Doctor. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' My companion flushed up with pleasure at my words, and the earnest way in which I uttered them.
<p/>I had already observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was as sensitive to flattery on the score of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) art as any girl could be of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) beauty.
<p/>Patent leathers -LSB-10-RSB- and Square-toes came in the same cab, and they walked down the pathway together as friendly as possible--arm-in-arm, in all probability.
<p/>When they got inside they walked up and down the room--or rather, Patent-leathers stood still while Square-toes walked up and down.
<p/>'' I'll tell you one other thing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said. '' I could read all that in the dust; and I could read that
<p/>as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) walked he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) grew more and more excited. That is shown by the increased length of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) strides. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was talking all the while, and working himself up, no doubt, into a fury.
<p/>Then the tragedy occurred. I've told you all I know myself now, for the rest is mere surmise and conjecture. We have a good working basis, however, on which to start.
<p/>This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways.
<p/>We must hurry up, for I want to go to Halle's concert to hear Norman Neruda this afternoon. '' In the dingiest and dreariest of them our driver suddenly came to a stand.
<p/>'' That's Audley Court in there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Court</b></font>) said, pointing to a narrow slit in the line of dead-coloured brick. '' You'll find me here when you come back.
<p/>'' Audley Court was not an attractive locality. The narrow passage led us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.
<p/>We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines of discoloured linen, until we came to Number 46, the door of which was decorated with a small slip of brass on which the name Rance was engraved.
<p/>On enquiry we found that the constable was in bed, and we were shown into a little front parlour to await his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) coming.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) appeared presently, looking a little irritable at being disturbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) slumbers. '' I made my report at the office,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>constable</b></font>) said.
<p/>Holmes took a half-sovereign from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) pocket and played with it pensively. '' We thought that we should like to hear it all from your own lips,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said.
<p/>I shall be most happy to tell you anything I can,'' the constable answered with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes upon the little golden disk.
<p/>Rance sat down on the horsehair sofa, and knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) brows as though determined not to omit anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) narrative.
<p/>'' '' Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred. '' '' I'll tell it ye from the beginning,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' My time is from ten at night to six in the morning. At eleven there was a fight at the `White Hart'; but bar that all was quiet enough on the beat.
<p/>At one o'clock it began to rain, and I met Harry Murcher--him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) who has the Holland Grove beat--and we stood together at the corner of Henrietta Street a-talkin'.
<p/>Presently--maybe about two or a little after--I thought I would take a look round and see that all was right down the Brixton Road.
<p/>It was precious dirty and lonely. Not a soul did I meet all the way down, though a cab or two went past me.
<p/>I was a strollin' down, thinkin' between ourselves how uncommon handy a four of gin hot would be, when suddenly the glint of a light caught my eye in the window of that same house.
<p/>Now, I knew that them two houses in Lauriston Gardens was empty on account of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) that owns them who won't have the drains seen to, though the very last tenant what lived in one of them died o' typhoid fever.
<p/>I was knocked all in a heap therefore at seeing a light in the window, and I suspected as something was wrong.
<p/>When I got to the door-- '' <div class="bookquote">``You stopped, and then walked back to the garden gate,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>my companion interrupted. ''
<p/>What did you do that for? '' Rance gave a violent jump, and stared at Sherlock Holmes with the utmost amazement upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) features.
<p/>'' Why, that's true, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``though how you come to know it, Heaven only knows. Ye see, when I got up to the door it was so still and so lonesome,
<p/>I ain't afeared of anything on this side o' the grave; but I thought that maybe it was him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) that died o' the typhoid inspecting the drains what killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>).
<p/>The thought gave me a kind o' turn, and I walked back to the gate to see if I could see Murcher's lantern, but there wasn't no sign of him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) nor of anyone else.
<p/>that I thought I'd be none the worse for some one with me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' There was no one in the street?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not a livin' soul, sir, nor as much as a dog. Then I pulled myself together and went back and pushed the door open.
<p/>All was quiet inside, so I went into the room where the light was a-burnin'. There was a candle flickerin' on the mantelpiece--a red wax one--and by its light I saw--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>You walked round the room several times, and you knelt down by the body, and then you walked through and tried the kitchen door, and then--
<p/>Yes, I know all that you saw. '' John Rance sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) feet with a frightened face and suspicion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Where was you hid to see all that? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) cried. '' It seems to me that you knows a deal more than you should.
<p/>'' Holmes laughed and threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) card across the table to the constable. '' Don't get arresting me for the murder,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I am one of the hounds and not the wolf; Mr. Gregson or Mr. Lestrade will answer for that. Go on, though.
<p/>What did you do next? '' Rance resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) seat, without however losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) mystified expression. '' I went back to the gate and sounded my whistle.
<p/>That brought Murcher and two more to the spot.'' <div class="bookquote">``Was the street empty then?''  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>'' Well, it was, as far as anybody that could be of any good goes.
<p/>'' '' What do you mean? '' The constable's features broadened into a grin. '' I've seen many a drunk chap in my time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but never anyone so cryin' drunk as that cove.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) was at the gate when I came out, a-leanin' up agin the railings, and a-singin' at the pitch o' his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) lungs about Columbine's New-fangled Banner, or some such stuff.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) couldn't stand, far less help.

(<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>asked Sherlock Holmes. John Rance appeared to be somewhat irritated at this digression.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) was an uncommon drunk sort o' man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) said. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>)'d ha' found hisself in the station if we hadn't been so took up.''
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) face--his (<font color='blue'><b>Rance</b></font>) dress-- didn't you notice them?'' Holmes broke in impatiently. '' I should think I did notice them, seeing that I had to prop him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) up--me and Murcher between us.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was a long chap, with a red face, the lower part muffled round-- '' <div class="bookquote">``That will do,''  (<font color='red'><b>a chap</b></font>)</div>cried Holmes. ''
<p/>What became of him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>)?'' '' We'd enough to do without lookin' after him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>),'' the policeman said, in an aggrieved voice. ''
<p/>I'll wager he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) way home all right.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>'' There's a half-sovereign for you,'' my companion said, standing up and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hat. '' I am afraid, Rance, that you will never rise in the force.
<p/>That head of yours should be for use as well as ornament. You might have gained your sergeant's stripes last night.
<p/>The man whom you held in your hands is the man who holds the clue of this mystery, and whom we are seeking.
<p/>There is no use of arguing about it now; I tell you that it is so. Come along, Doctor. '' We started off for the cab together, leaving our informant incredulous, but obviously uncomfortable.
<p/>'' The blundering fool,'' Holmes said, bitterly, as we drove back to our lodgings. '' Just to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) having such an incomparable bit of good luck, and not taking advantage of it.

<p/>Doctor--I'll lay you two to one that I have him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>). I must thank you for it all. Why shouldn't we use a little art jargon.
<p/>There's the scarlet thread of murder running through the colourless skein of life, and our duty is to unravel it, and isolate it, and expose every inch of it.

<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) plays so magnificently: Tra-la-la-lira-lira-lay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER V. OUR ADVERTISEMENT BRINGS A VISITOR. OUR morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I was tired out in the afternoon.
<p/>After Holmes' departure for the concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of hours' sleep.
<p/>My mind had been too much excited by all that had occurred, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.
<p/>It was a useless attempt. Every time that I closed my eyes I saw before me the distorted baboon-like countenance of the murdered man.
<p/>So sinister was the impression which that face had produced upon me that I found it difficult to feel anything but gratitude for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who had removed its owner from the world.
<p/>If ever human features bespoke vice of the most malignant type, they were certainly those of Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland.
<p/>Still I recognized that justice must be done, and that the depravity of the victim was no condonment -LSB-11-RSB- in the eyes of the law.
<p/>I remembered how he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had sniffed his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) lips, and had no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had detected something which had given rise to the idea.
<p/>The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion's hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. Then, again, if not poison, what had caused the man's death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation?
<p/>There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) might have wounded an antagonist.
<p/>As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter, either for Holmes or myself.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) quiet self-confident manner convinced me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had already formed a theory which explained all the facts, though what it was I could not for an instant conjecture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was very late in returning--so late, that I knew that the concert could not have detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) all the time.
<p/>But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? Dinner was on the table before he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) appeared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) claims that the power of producing and appreciating it existed among the human race long before the power of speech was arrived at.
<p/>'' It was magnificent,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) seat. '' Do you remember what Darwin says about music? Perhaps that is why we are so subtly influenced by it.
<p/>There are vague memories in our souls of those misty centuries when the world was in its childhood.'' '' That's rather a broad idea,'' I remarked.
<p/>'' One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) answered. '' What's the matter?
<p/>You're not looking quite yourself. This Brixton Road affair has upset you.'' '' To tell the truth, it has,'' I said.
<p/>'' I ought to be more case-hardened after my Afghan experiences. I saw my own comrades hacked to pieces at Maiwand without losing my nerve.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I can understand. There is a mystery about this which stimulates the imagination; where there is no imagination there is no horror.

<p/>In Brixton Road, this morning,'' it ran, <div class="bookquote">``a plain gold wedding ring, found in the roadway between the `White Hart' Tavern and Holland Grove.

<p/>'' If I used my own some of these dunderheads would recognize it, and want to meddle in the affair.'' ''
<p/>That is all right,'' I answered. '' But supposing anyone applies, I have no ring. '' '' Oh yes, you have,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Baker</b></font>), handing me one.
<p/>'' This will do very well. It is almost a facsimile.'' '' And who do you expect will answer this advertisement.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, the man in the brown coat--our florid friend with the square toes. If he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does not come himself he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will send an accomplice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>If my view of the case is correct, and I have every reason to believe that it is, this man would rather risk anything than lose the ring.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not consider it as too dangerous?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all. According to my notion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dropped it while stooping over Drebber's body, and did not miss it at the time.
<p/>After leaving the house he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discovered his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loss and hurried back, but found the police already in possession, owing to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own folly in leaving the candle burning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to pretend to be drunk in order to allay the suspicions which might have been aroused by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance at the gate.
<p/>On thinking the matter over, it must have occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that it was possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost the ring in the road after leaving the house.
<p/>Now put yourself in that man's place. What would he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do, then? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would eagerly look out for the evening papers in the hope of seeing it among the articles found.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, of course, would light upon this. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be overjoyed. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fear a trap? There would be no reason in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes why the finding of the ring should be connected with the murder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would come. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will come. You shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) within an hour?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And then?'' I asked. '' Oh, you can leave me to deal with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then.
<p/>Have you any arms?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have my old service revolver and a few cartridges. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' You had better clean it and load it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be a desperate man, and though I shall take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unawares, it is as well to be ready for anything.
<p/>When I returned with the pistol the table had been cleared, and Holmes was engaged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) favourite occupation of scraping upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) violin.
<p/>'' I went to my bedroom and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) advice. '' The plot thickens,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said, as I entered; <div class="bookquote">``I have just had an answer to my American telegram.
<p/>My view of the case is the correct one.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And that is? '' I asked eagerly. '' My fiddle would be the better for new strings,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) remarked.

<p/>We heard the servant pass along the hall, and the sharp click of the latch as she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) opened it. '' Does Dr. Watson live here?
<p/>'' asked a clear but rather harsh voice. We could not hear the servant's reply, but the door closed, and some one began to ascend the stairs.
<p/>The footfall was an uncertain and shuffling one. A look of surprise passed over the face of my companion as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) listened to it.
<p/>At my summons, instead of the man of violence whom we expected, a very old and wrinkled woman hobbled into the apartment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) appeared to be dazzled by the sudden blaze of light, and after dropping a curtsey, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stood blinking at us with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bleared eyes and fumbling in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pocket with nervous, shaky fingers.
<p/>I glanced at my companion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) face had assumed such a disconsolate expression that it was all I could do to keep my countenance.
<p/>It came slowly along the passage, and there was a feeble tap at the door. <div class="bookquote">``Come in,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. The old crone drew out an evening paper, and pointed at our advertisement.

<p/>The instant he (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) entered I saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henri</b></font>) had not been successful. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I can afford to laugh, because I know that I will be even with them in the long run.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What is it then? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Oh, I don't mind telling a story against myself. That creature had gone a little way when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) began to limp and show every sign of being foot-sore.
<p/>I managed to be close to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) so as to hear the address, but I need not have been so anxious, for she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sang it out loud enough to be heard at the other side of the street, `Drive to 13, Duncan Street, Houndsditch,' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cried.
<p/>Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) came to a halt, and hailed a four-wheeler which was passing. This begins to look genuine, I thought, and having seen her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) safely inside, I perched myself behind.
<p/>That's an art which every detective should be an expert at. Well, away we rattled, and never drew rein until we reached the street in question.
<p/>I hopped off before we came to the door, and strolled down the street in an easy, lounging way. I saw the cab pull up.
<p/>When I reached him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) was groping about frantically in the empty cab, and giving vent to the finest assorted collection of oaths that ever I listened to.
<p/>There was no sign or trace of his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) passenger, and I fear it will be some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) gets his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) fare.
<p/>On inquiring at Number 13 we found that the house belonged to a respectable paperhanger, named Keswick, and that no one of the name either of Sawyer or Dennis had ever been heard of there.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, in amazement, <div class="bookquote">``that that tottering, feeble old woman was able to get out of the cab while it was in motion, without either you or the driver seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>The driver jumped down, and I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) open the door and stand expectantly. Nothing came out though. '' <div class="bookquote">``Old woman be damned!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Sherlock Holmes, sharply.
<p/>'' We were the old women to be so taken in. It must have been a young man, and an active one, too, besides being an incomparable actor.
<p/>The get-up was inimitable. He (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) was followed, no doubt, and used this means of giving me the slip.
<p/>It shows that the man we are after is not as lonely as I imagined he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, but has friends who are ready to risk something for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Now, Doctor, you are looking done-up. Take my advice and turn in. '' I was certainly feeling very weary, so I obeyed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) injunction.
<p/>I left Holmes seated in front of the smouldering fire, and long into the watches of the night I heard the low, melancholy wailings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) violin, and knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was still pondering over the strange problem which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had set himself to unravel.
<p/>CHAPTER VI. TOBIAS GREGSON SHOWS WHAT HE (<font color='blue'><b>GREGSON</b></font>) CAN DO. THE papers next day were full of the <div class="bookquote">``Brixton Mystery,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as they termed it.
<p/>Each had a long account of the affair, and some had leaders upon it in addition. There was some information in them which was new to me.
<p/>I still retain in my scrap-book numerous clippings and extracts bearing upon the case. Here is a condensation of a few of them:--
<p/>The German name of the victim, the absence of all other motive, and the sinister inscription on the wall, all pointed to its perpetration by political refugees and revolutionists.
<p/>The Socialists had many branches in America, and the deceased had, no doubt, infringed their unwritten laws, and been tracked down by them.
<p/>After alluding airily to the Vehmgericht, aqua tofana, Carbonari, the Marchioness de Brinvilliers, the Darwinian theory, the principles of Malthus, and the Ratcliff Highway murders, the article concluded by admonishing the Government and advocating a closer watch over foreigners in England.
<p/>The Daily Telegraph remarked that in the history of crime there had seldom been a tragedy which presented stranger features. The Standard commented upon the fact that lawless outrages of the sort usually occurred under a Liberal Administration.
<p/>They arose from the unsettling of the minds of the masses, and the consequent weakening of all authority. The deceased was an American gentleman who had been residing for some weeks in the Metropolis.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had stayed at the boarding-house of Madame Charpentier, in Torquay Terrace, Camberwell. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) was accompanied in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) travels by his (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) private secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson.
<p/>The two bade adieu to their landlady upon Tuesday, the 4th inst., and departed to Euston Station with the avowed intention of catching the Liverpool express.
<p/>Nothing more is known of them until Mr. Drebber's body was, as recorded, discovered in an empty house in the Brixton Road, many miles from Euston.
<p/>They were afterwards seen together upon the platform. How he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) came there, or how he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) met his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) fate, are questions which are still involved in mystery.
<p/>We are glad to learn that Mr. Lestrade and Mr. Gregson, of Scotland Yard, are both engaged upon the case, and it is confidently anticipated that these well-known officers will speedily throw light upon the matter.
<p/>Nothing is known of the whereabouts of Stangerson. The Daily News observed that there was no doubt as to the crime being a political one.
<p/>The despotism and hatred of Liberalism which animated the Continental Governments had had the effect of driving to our shores a number of men who might have made excellent citizens were they not soured by the recollection of all that they had undergone.
<p/>Every effort should be made to find the secretary, Stangerson, and to ascertain some particulars of the habits of the deceased.
<p/>A great step had been gained by the discovery of the address of the house at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) had boarded--a result which was entirely due to the acuteness and energy of Mr. Gregson of Scotland Yard.
<p/>Among these men there was a stringent code of honour, any infringement of which was punished by death. Sherlock Holmes and I read these notices over together at breakfast, and they appeared to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) considerable amusement.
<p/>'' I told you that, whatever happened, Lestrade and Gregson would be sure to score.'' <div class="bookquote">``That depends on how it turns out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>If the man is caught, it will be on account of their exertions; if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escapes, it will be in spite of their exertions.
<p/>'' Oh, bless you, it doesn't matter in the least. It's heads I win and tails you lose. Whatever they do, they will have followers. '
<p/>I cried, for at this moment there came the pattering of many steps in the hall and on the stairs, accompanied by audible expressions of disgust upon the part of our landlady.
<p/>It's the Baker Street division of the detective police force,'' said my companion, gravely; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) spoke there rushed into the room half a dozen of the dirtiest and most ragged street Arabs that ever I clapped eyes on.
<p/>'' cried Holmes, in a sharp tone, and the six dirty little scoundrels stood in a line like so many disreputable statuettes.
<p/>Un sot trouve toujours un plus sot qui l'admire.' '' '' What on earth is this? '' '' '' `Tention! ''
<p/>In future you shall send up Wiggins alone to report, and the rest of you must wait in the street. Have you found it, Wiggins?''
<p/>'' No, sir, we hain't,'' said one of the youths. '' I hardly expected you would. You must keep on until you do.
<p/>Here are your wages. '' -LSB-13-RSB- He (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) handed each of them a shilling. '' Now, off you go, and come back with a better report next time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) hand, and they scampered away downstairs like so many rats, and we heard their shrill voices next moment in the street.
<p/>There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than out of a dozen of the force,'' Holmes remarked.
<p/>'' '' '' The mere sight of an official-looking person seals men's lips. These youngsters, however, go everywhere and hear everything.
<p/>They are as sharp as needles, too; all they want is organisation. '' <div class="bookquote">``Is it on this Brixton case that you are employing them?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Yes; there is a point which I wish to ascertain. It is merely a matter of time.
<p/>Hullo! we are going to hear some news now with a vengeance! Here is Gregson coming down the road with beatitude written upon every feature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) face.
<p/>There was a violent peal at the bell, and in a few seconds the fair-haired detective came up the stairs, three steps at a time, and burst into our sitting-room.
<p/>Bound for us, I know. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) is stopping. There he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) is! '' '' My dear fellow,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) cried, wringing Holmes' unresponsive hand, <div class="bookquote">``congratulate me!
<p/>I have made the whole thing as clear as day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>A shade of anxiety seemed to me to cross my companion's expressive face.
<p/>'' Do you mean that you are on the right track? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) asked. '' The right track! Why, sir, we have the man under lock and key.''
<p/>'' And his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name is?'' <div class="bookquote">``Arthur Charpentier, sub-lieutenant in Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Majesty's navy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregson/TOBIAS GREGSON/Tobias Gregson</b></font>)</div>cried Gregson, pompously, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) fat hands and inflating his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) chest.
<p/>Sherlock Holmes gave a sigh of relief, and relaxed into a smile. '' Take a seat, and try one of these cigars,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' We are anxious to know how you managed it. Will you have some whiskey and water?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't mind if I do,''  (<font color='red'><b>the detective</b></font>)</div>the detective answered.
<p/>'' The tremendous exertions which I have gone through during the last day or two have worn me out. Not so much bodily exertion, you understand, as the strain upon the mind.
<p/>You will appreciate that, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, for we are both brain-workers.'' <div class="bookquote">``You do me too much honour,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, gravely.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us hear how you arrived at this most gratifying result. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The detective</b></font>)</div>The detective seated himself in the arm-chair, and puffed complacently at his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) cigar.
<p/>The fun of it is,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``that that fool Lestrade, who thinks himself so smart, has gone off upon the wrong track altogether.
<p/>Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) slapped his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) thigh in a paroxysm of amusement. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) is after the secretary Stangerson, who had no more to do with the crime than the babe unborn.
<p/>I have no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) has caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) by this time. '' The idea tickled Gregson so much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) laughed until he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) choked.
<p/>'' And how did you get your clue?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, I'll tell you all about it. Of course, Doctor Watson, this is strictly between ourselves.
<p/>The first difficulty which we had to contend with was the finding of this American's antecedents. Some people would have waited until their advertisements were answered, or until parties came forward and volunteered information.
<p/>That is not Tobias Gregson's way of going to work. You remember the hat beside the dead man?''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' said Holmes; <div class="bookquote">``by John Underwood and Sons, 129, Camberwell Road.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Gregson looked quite crest-fallen. '' I had no idea that you noticed that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) said. '' Have you been there?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ha!''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregson/TOBIAS GREGSON/Tobias Gregson</b></font>)</div>cried Gregson, in a relieved voice; <div class="bookquote">``you should never neglect a chance, however small it may seem. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregson/TOBIAS GREGSON/Tobias Gregson</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To a great mind, nothing is little,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>remarked Holmes, sententiously.
<p/>'' Well, I went to Underwood, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) had sold a hat of that size and description. He (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) looked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) books, and came on it at once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) had sent the hat to a Mr. Drebber, residing at Charpentier's Boarding Establishment, Torquay Terrace. Thus I got at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) address.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Smart--very smart! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>murmured Sherlock Holmes. '' I next called upon Madame Charpentier,'' continued the detective. '' I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) very pale and distressed.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) daughter was in the room, too--an uncommonly fine girl she (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) is, too; she (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) was looking red about the eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>) lips trembled as I spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Underwood</b></font>).
<p/>You know the feeling, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, when you come upon the right scent--a kind of thrill in your nerves. '
<p/>That didn't escape my notice. I began to smell a rat. Have you heard of the mysterious death of your late boarder Mr. Enoch J. Drebber, of Cleveland?'
<p/>I asked. '' The mother nodded. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) didn't seem able to get out a word. The daughter burst into tears. I felt more than ever that these people knew something of the matter.
<p/>''`At what o'clock did Mr. Drebber leave your house for the train?' I asked. ''`At eight o'clock,' she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said, gulping in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) throat to keep down her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) agitation. '
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) secretary, Mr. Stangerson, said that there were two trains--one at 9.15 and one at 11. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) was to catch the first.
<p/>-LSB-14-RSB- '' ' And was that the last which you saw of him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>)?' '' A terrible change came over the woman's face as I asked the question.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features turned perfectly livid. It was some seconds before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could get out the single word `Yes'--and when it did come it was in a husky unnatural tone.
<p/>'' There was silence for a moment, and then the daughter spoke in a calm clear voice. '' `No good can ever come of falsehood, mother,' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said. '
<p/>Let us be frank with this gentleman. We did see Mr. Drebber again.' '' `God forgive you!' cried Madame Charpentier, throwing up her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hands and sinking back in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chair. '
<p/>You have murdered your brother.' ''`Arthur would rather that we spoke the truth,' the girl answered firmly. ''`You had best tell me all about it now,' I said.
<p/>' Half-confidences are worse than none. Besides, you do not know how much we know of it.' ''`On your head be it, Alice!' cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mother; and
<p/>Do not imagine that my agitation on behalf of my son arises from any fear lest he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should have had a hand in this terrible affair.
<p/>then, turning to me, 'I will tell you all, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is utterly innocent of it. My dread is, however, that in your eyes and in the eyes of others he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) may appear to be compromised.
<p/>That however is surely impossible. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) high character, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) profession, his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) antecedents would all forbid it.' ''`Your best way is to make a clean breast of the facts,' I answered. '
<p/>Depend upon it, if your son is innocent he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) will be none the worse.' '' `Perhaps, Alice, you had better leave us together,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) daughter withdrew. '
<p/>Now, sir,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) continued, 'I had no intention of telling you all this, but since my poor daughter has disclosed it I have no alternative.
<p/>Having once decided to speak, I will tell you all without omitting any particular.' ''`It is your wisest course,' said I.
<p/>''`Mr. Drebber has been with us nearly three weeks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) secretary, Mr. Stangerson, had been travelling on the Continent.
<p/>I noticed a <div class="bookquote">``Copenhagen''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>label upon each of their trunks, showing that that had been their last stopping place. Stangerson was a quiet reserved man, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) employer, I am sorry to say, was far otherwise.
<p/>The very night of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed, after twelve o'clock in the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) could hardly ever be said to be sober.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) was coarse in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) habits and brutish in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) ways. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) manners towards the maid-servants were disgustingly free and familiar.
<p/>Worst of all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) speedily assumed the same attitude towards my daughter, Alice, and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) more than once in a way which, fortunately, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is too innocent to understand.
<p/>On one occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) actually seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) arms and embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)--an outrage which caused his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) own secretary to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) unmanly conduct.'
<p/>''`But why did you stand all this,' I asked. ' I suppose that you can get rid of your boarders when you wish.'
<p/>'' Mrs. Charpentier blushed at my pertinent question. ' Would to God that I had given him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) notice on the very day that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) said. '
<p/>But it was a sore temptation. They were paying a pound a day each--fourteen pounds a week, and this is the slack season.
<p/>I am a widow, and my boy in the Navy has cost me much. I grudged to lose the money. I acted for the best.
<p/>This last was too much, however, and I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) notice to leave on account of it. That was the reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) going.'
<p/>My son is on leave just now, but I did not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) anything of all this, for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) temper is violent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is passionately fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister.
<p/>'' ' Well?' ''`My heart grew light when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) drive away. When I closed the door behind them a load seemed to be lifted from my mind.
<p/>Alas, in less than an hour there was a ring at the bell, and I learned that Mr. Drebber had returned.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) way into the room, where I was sitting with my daughter, and made some incoherent remark about having missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) train.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) was much excited, and evidently the worse for drink. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) then turned to Alice, and before my very face, proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should fly with him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>).
<p/>'' You are of age,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and there is no law to stop you. I have money enough and to spare.
<p/>Never mind the old girl here, but come along with me now straight away. You shall live like a princess. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Alice was so frightened that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shrunk away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) by the wrist and endeavoured to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) towards the door.
<p/>I screamed, and at that moment my son Arthur came into the room. What happened then I do not know. I heard oaths and the confused sounds of a scuffle.
<p/>I was too terrified to raise my head. When I did look up I saw Arthur standing in the doorway laughing, with a stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>Arthur</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' I don't think that fine fellow will trouble us again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said. '' I will just go after him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and see what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) does with himself.
<p/>'' With those words he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hat and started off down the street. The next morning we heard of Mr. Drebber's mysterious death.'
<p/>'' This statement came from Mrs. Charpentier's lips with many gasps and pauses. At times she (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) spoke so low that I could hardly catch the words.
<p/>I made shorthand notes of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) said, however, so that there should be no possibility of a mistake. ''
<p/>'' It's quite exciting,'' said Sherlock Holmes, with a yawn. '' What happened next?'' '' When Mrs. Charpentier paused,'' the detective continued, <div class="bookquote">``I saw that the whole case hung upon one point.
<p/>Fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) with my eye in a way which I always found effective with women, I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) at what hour her (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) son returned.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the detective</b></font>)</div>'I do not know,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) answered. ''`Not know?' '' ' No; he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) has a latch-key, and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) let himself in.'
<p/>'' `After you went to bed?' ''`Yes.' ''`When did you go to bed?' ''`About eleven.' '' `So your son was gone at least two hours?'
<p/>''`Yes.' ''`Possibly four or five?' '' ' Yes.' ''`What was he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) doing during that time?' '' 'I do not know,' she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) answered, turning white to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) very lips.
<p/>'' Of course after that there was nothing more to be done. I found out where Lieutenant Charpentier was, took two officers with me, and arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>).
<p/>When I touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) on the shoulder and warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) to come quietly with us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) answered us as bold as brass, 'I suppose you are arresting me for being concerned in the death of that scoundrel Drebber,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) said.
<p/>We had said nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) about it, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) alluding to it had a most suspicious aspect. '' <div class="bookquote">``Very,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) still carried the heavy stick which the mother described him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) as having with him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) followed Drebber. It was a stout oak cudgel.
<p/>'' '' What is your theory, then?'' '' Well, my theory is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) followed Drebber as far as the Brixton Road.
<p/>When there, a fresh altercation arose between them, in the course of which Drebber received a blow from the stick, in the pit of the stomach, perhaps, which killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) without leaving any mark.
<p/>The night was so wet that no one was about, so Charpentier dragged the body of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) victim into the empty house.
<p/>As to the candle, and the blood, and the writing on the wall, and the ring, they may all be so many tricks to throw the police on to the wrong scent.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well done!''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes in an encouraging voice. '' Really, Gregson, you are getting along. We shall make something of you yet.
<p/>The young man volunteered a statement, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said that after following Drebber some time, the latter perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and took a cab in order to get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I flatter myself that I have managed it rather neatly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the detective</b></font>)</div>the detective answered proudly. '' On his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) way home he (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) met an old shipmate, and took a long walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>).
<p/>On being asked where this old shipmate lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>shipmate</b></font>) was unable to give any satisfactory reply. I think the whole case fits together uncommonly well.
<p/>What amuses me is to think of Lestrade, who had started off upon the wrong scent. I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>shipmate</b></font>) won't make much of -LSB-15-RSB-
<p/>Why, by Jove, here's the very man himself! '' It was indeed Lestrade, who had ascended the stairs while we were talking, and who now entered the room.
<p/>The assurance and jauntiness which generally marked his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) demeanour and dress were, however, wanting. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) face was disturbed and troubled, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) clothes were disarranged and untidy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) had evidently come with the intention of consulting with Sherlock Holmes, for on perceiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) colleague he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) appeared to be embarrassed and put out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) stood in the centre of the room, fumbling nervously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) hat and uncertain what to do. '' This is a most extraordinary case,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said at last--<div class="bookquote">``a most incomprehensible affair.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, you find it so, Mr. Lestrade! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregson/TOBIAS GREGSON/Tobias Gregson</b></font>)</div>cried Gregson, triumphantly. '' I thought you would come to that conclusion. Have you managed to find the Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson?''
<p/>'' The Secretary, Mr. Joseph Stangerson,'' said Lestrade gravely, <div class="bookquote">``was murdered at Halliday's Private Hotel about six o'clock this morning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lestrade/Mr. Lestrade</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VII.
<p/>LIGHT IN THE DARKNESS. THE intelligence with which Lestrade greeted us was so momentous and so unexpected, that we were all three fairly dumfoundered.
<p/>Gregson sprang out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) chair and upset the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) whiskey and water. I stared in silence at Sherlock Holmes, whose lips were compressed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) brows drawn down over his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Stangerson too! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) muttered. '' The plot thickens. '' <div class="bookquote">``It was quite thick enough before,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lestrade/Mr. Lestrade</b></font>)</div>grumbled Lestrade, taking a chair.
<p/>'' I seem to have dropped into a sort of council of war.'' <div class="bookquote">``Are you--are you sure of this piece of intelligence?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Gregson/TOBIAS GREGSON/Tobias Gregson</b></font>)</div>stammered Gregson. '' I have just come from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) room,'' said Lestrade. '' I was the first to discover what had occurred.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``We have been hearing Gregson's view of the matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>Holmes observed. '' Would you mind letting us know what you have seen and done?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no objection,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lestrade/Mr. Lestrade</b></font>)</div>Lestrade answered, seating himself. '' I freely confess that I was of the opinion that Stangerson was concerned in the death of Drebber.
<p/>This fresh development has shown me that I was completely mistaken. Full of the one idea, I set myself to find out what had become of the Secretary.
<p/>They had been seen together at Euston Station about half-past eight on the evening of the third. At two in the morning Drebber had been found in the Brixton Road.
<p/>The question which confronted me was to find out how Stangerson had been employed between 8.30 and the time of the crime, and what had become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) afterwards.
<p/>I telegraphed to Liverpool, giving a description of the man, and warning them to keep a watch upon the American boats.
<p/>You see, I argued that if Drebber and his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) companion had become separated, the natural course for the latter would be to put up somewhere in the vicinity for the night, and then to hang about the station again next morning.''
<p/>I then set to work calling upon all the hotels and lodging-houses in the vicinity of Euston. <div class="bookquote">``They would be likely to agree on some meeting-place beforehand,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>remarked Holmes.
<p/>'' So it proved. I spent the whole of yesterday evening in making enquiries entirely without avail. This morning I began very early, and at eight o'clock I reached Halliday's Private Hotel, in Little George Street.
<p/>On my enquiry as to whether a Mr. Stangerson was living there, they at once answered me in the affirmative. ''`No doubt you are the gentleman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was expecting,' they said. '
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has been waiting for a gentleman for two days.' ''`Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) now?' I asked. ''' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is upstairs in bed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wished to be called at nine.' '''I will go up and see him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) at once,' I said. '' It seemed to me that my sudden appearance might shake his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nerves and lead him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to say something unguarded.
<p/>The Boots volunteered to show me the room: it was on the second floor, and there was a small corridor leading up to it.
<p/>The Boots pointed out the door to me, and was about to go downstairs again when I saw something that made me feel sickish, in spite of my twenty years' experience.
<p/>From under the door there curled a little red ribbon of blood, which had meandered across the passage and formed a little pool along the skirting at the other side.
<p/>I gave a cry, which brought the Boots back. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) nearly fainted when he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) saw it. The door was locked on the inside, but we put our shoulders to it, and knocked it in.
<p/>The window of the room was open, and beside the window, all huddled up, lay the body of a man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nightdress.
<p/>When we turned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over, the Boots recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once as being the same gentleman who had engaged the room under the name of Joseph Stangerson.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) was quite dead, and had been for some time, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) limbs were rigid and cold. The cause of death was a deep stab in the left side, which must have penetrated the heart.
<p/>And now comes the strangest part of the affair. What do you suppose was above the murdered man? '' I felt a creeping of the flesh, and a presentiment of coming horror, even before Sherlock Holmes answered.
<p/>'' The word RACHE, written in letters of blood,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said. '' That was it,'' said Lestrade, in an awe-struck voice; and we were all silent for a while.
<p/>There was something so methodical and so incomprehensible about the deeds of this unknown assassin, that it imparted a fresh ghastliness to his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) crimes.
<p/>My nerves, which were steady enough on the field of battle tingled as I thought of it. '' The man was seen,'' continued Lestrade.
<p/>A milk boy, passing on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) way to the dairy, happened to walk down the lane which leads from the mews at the back of the hotel.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) noticed that a ladder, which usually lay there, was raised against one of the windows of the second floor, which was wide open.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came down so quietly and openly that the boy imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to be some carpenter or joiner at work in the hotel.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) took no particular notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), beyond thinking in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own mind that it was early for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to be at work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has an impression that the man was tall, had a reddish face, and was dressed in a long, brownish coat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must have stayed in the room some little time after the murder, for we found blood-stained water in the basin, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had washed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and marks on the sheets where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had deliberately wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knife.
<p/>'' After passing, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked back and saw a man descend the ladder. '' I glanced at Holmes on hearing the description of the murderer, which tallied so exactly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) own.
<p/>There was, however, no trace of exultation or satisfaction upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face. '' Did you find nothing in the room which could furnish a clue to the murderer?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) asked. '' Nothing. Stangerson had Drebber's purse in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) pocket, but it seems that this was usual, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) did all the paying.
<p/>There was eighty odd pounds in it, but nothing had been taken. Whatever the motives of these extraordinary crimes, robbery is certainly not one of them.
<p/>There were no papers or memoranda in the murdered man's pocket, except a single telegram, dated from Cleveland about a month ago, and containing the words, `J. H. is in Europe.'
<p/>There was no name appended to this message.'' '' And there was nothing else?'' Holmes asked. '' Nothing of any importance.
<p/>The man's novel, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had read himself to sleep was lying upon the bed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe was on a chair beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>There was a glass of water on the table, and on the window-sill a small chip ointment box containing a couple of pills.
<p/>'' Sherlock Holmes sprang from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) chair with an exclamation of delight. '' The last link,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) cried, exultantly. '' My case is complete.
<p/>'' The two detectives stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) in amazement. '' I have now in my hands,'' my companion said, confidently, <div class="bookquote">``all the threads which have formed such a tangle.
<p/>There are, of course, details to be filled in, but I am as certain of all the main facts, from the time that Drebber parted from Stangerson at the station, up to the discovery of the body of the latter, as if I had seen them with my own eyes.
<p/>I will give you a proof of my knowledge. Could you lay your hand upon those pills?''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lestrade/Mr. Lestrade</b></font>)</div>said Lestrade, producing a small white box;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I took them and the purse and the telegram, intending to have them put in a place of safety at the Police Station.
<p/>It was the merest chance my taking these pills, for I am bound to say that I do not attach any importance to them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lestrade/Mr. Lestrade</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Give them here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes. '' Now, Doctor,'' turning to me, <div class="bookquote">``are those ordinary pills? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>They certainly were not. They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light.
<p/>'' From their lightness and transparency, I should imagine that they are soluble in water,'' I remarked. '' Precisely so,'' answered Holmes.
<p/>Now would you mind going down and fetching that poor little devil of a terrier which has been bad so long, and which the landlady wanted you to put out of its pain yesterday.
<p/>'' '' I went downstairs and carried the dog upstair in my arms. It's laboured breathing and glazing eye showed that it was not far from its end.
<p/>Indeed, its snow-white muzzle proclaimed that it had already exceeded the usual term of canine existence. I placed it upon a cushion on the rug.
<p/>I will now cut one of these pills in two,'' said Holmes, and drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) penknife he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) suited the action to the word.
<p/>'' '' One half we return into the box for future purposes. The other half I will place in this wine glass, in which is a teaspoonful of water.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``This may be very interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lestrade/Mr. Lestrade</b></font>)</div>said Lestrade, in the injured tone of one who suspects that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) is being laughed at, <div class="bookquote">``I cannot see, however, what it has to do with the death of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>You perceive that our friend, the Doctor, is right, and that it readily dissolves. '' <div class="bookquote">``Patience, my friend, patience! You will find in time that it has everything to do with it.
<p/>I shall now add a little milk to make the mixture palatable, and on presenting it to the dog we find that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) laps it up readily enough.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turned the contents of the wine glass into a saucer and placed it in front of the terrier, who speedily licked it dry.
<p/>Sherlock Holmes' earnest demeanour had so far convinced us that we all sat in silence, watching the animal intently, and expecting some startling effect.
<p/>The dog continued to lie stretched upon tho -LSB-16-RSB- cushion, breathing in a laboured way, but apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.
<p/>Holmes had taken out his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) watch, and as minute followed minute without result, an expression of the utmost chagrin and disappointment appeared upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) features.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>None such appeared, however. He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) gnawed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) lip, drummed his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) fingers upon the table, and showed every other symptom of acute impatience.
<p/>So great was his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) emotion, that I felt sincerely sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), while the two detectives smiled derisively, by no means displeased at this check which he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) had met.
<p/>It can't be a coincidence,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) cried, at last springing from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) chair and pacing wildly up and down the room; <div class="bookquote">``it is impossible that it should be a mere coincidence.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The very pills which I suspected in the case of Drebber are actually found after the death of Stangerson. And yet they are inert.
<p/>What can it mean? Surely my whole chain of reasoning cannot have been false. It is impossible! And yet this wretched dog is none the worse.
<p/>With a perfect shriek of delight he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) rushed to the box, cut the other pill in two, dissolved it, added milk, and presented it to the terrier.
<p/>The unfortunate creature's tongue seemed hardly to have been moistened in it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid and lifeless as if it had been struck by lightning.
<p/>Ah, I have it! I have it!'' Sherlock Holmes drew a long breath, and wiped the perspiration from his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) forehead. ''
<p/>I should have more faith,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I ought to know by this time that when a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation.
<p/>Of the two pills in that box one was of the most deadly poison, and the other was entirely harmless. I ought to have known that before ever I saw the box at all.
<p/>This last statement appeared to me to be so startling, that I could hardly believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) sober senses.
<p/>It seemed to me that the mists in my own mind were gradually clearing away, and I began to have a dim, vague perception of the truth.
<p/>All this seems strange to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued Holmes, <div class="bookquote">``because you failed at the beginning of the inquiry to grasp the importance of the single real clue which was presented to you.
<p/>I had the good fortune to seize upon that, and everything which has occurred since then has served to confirm my original supposition, and, indeed, was the logical sequence of it.
<p/>Hence things which have perplexed you and made the case more obscure, have served to enlighten me and to strengthen my conclusions.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>There was the dead dog, however, to prove that his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) conjecture had been correct. '' It is a mistake to confound strangeness with mystery.
<p/>The most commonplace crime is often the most mysterious because it presents no new or special features from which deductions may be drawn.
<p/>This murder would have been infinitely more difficult to unravel had the body of the victim been simply found lying in the roadway without any of those outré and sensational accompaniments which have rendered it remarkable.
<p/>These strange details, far from making the case more difficult, have really had the effect of making it less so. ''
<p/>Look here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we are all ready to acknowledge that you are a smart man, and that you have your own methods of working.
<p/>Mr. Gregson, who had listened to this address with considerable impatience, could contain himself no longer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We want something more than mere theory and preaching now, though.
<p/>It is a case of taking the man. I have made my case out, and it seems I was wrong. Young Charpentier could not have been engaged in this second affair.
<p/>You have thrown out hints here, and hints there, and seem to know more than we do, but the time has come when we feel that we have a right to ask you straight how much you do know of the business.
<p/>Lestrade went after his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) man, Stangerson, and it appears that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) was wrong too. Can you name the man who did it?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot help feeling that Gregson is right, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>remarked Lestrade. '' We have both tried, and we have both failed.
<p/>You have remarked more than once since I have been in the room that you had all the evidence which you require.
<p/>Surely you will not withhold it any longer.'' <div class="bookquote">``Any delay in arresting the assassin,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I observed, <div class="bookquote">``might give him (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) time to perpetrate some fresh atrocity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) continued to walk up and down the room with his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) head sunk on his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) chest and his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) brows drawn down, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) habit when lost in thought.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Thus pressed by us all, Holmes showed signs of irresolution. '' There will be no more murders,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) said at last, stopping abruptly and facing us.
<p/>'' You can put that consideration out of the question. You have asked me if I know the name of the assassin.
<p/>The mere knowing of his (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>) name is a small thing, however, compared with the power of laying our hands upon him (<font color='blue'><b>assassin</b></font>).
<p/>I have good hopes of managing it through my own arrangements; but it is a thing which needs delicate handling, for we have a shrewd and desperate man to deal with, who is supported, as I have had occasion to prove, by another who is as clever as himself.
<p/>As long as this man has no idea that anyone can have a clue there is some chance of securing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the slightest suspicion, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would change his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name, and vanish in an instant among the four million inhabitants of this great city.
<p/>Without meaning to hurt either of your feelings, I am bound to say that I consider these men to be more than a match for the official force, and that is why I have not asked your assistance.
<p/>If I fail I shall, of course, incur all the blame due to this omission; but that I am prepared for.
<p/>At present I am ready to promise that the instant that I can communicate with you without endangering my own combinations, I shall do so.
<p/>Gregson and Lestrade seemed to be far from satisfied by this assurance, or by the depreciating allusion to the detective police.
<p/>The former had flushed up to the roots of his (<font color='blue'><b>detective</b></font>) flaxen hair, while the other's beady eyes glistened with curiosity and resentment.
<p/>Neither of them had time to speak, however, before there was a tap at the door, and the spokesman of the street Arabs, young Wiggins, introduced his (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) insignificant and unsavoury person.
<p/>I do. This I expect very shortly to do. '' '' Please, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) said, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) forelock, <div class="bookquote">``I have the cab downstairs.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Good boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, blandly. '' Why don't you introduce this pattern at Scotland Yard? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) continued, taking a pair of steel handcuffs from a drawer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``See how beautifully the spring works. They fasten in an instant.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lestrade/Mr. Lestrade</b></font>)</div>'' The old pattern is good enough,'' remarked Lestrade, <div class="bookquote">``if we can only find the man to put them on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lestrade/Mr. Lestrade</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very good, very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes, smiling. '' The cabman may as well help me with my boxes. Just ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) to step up, Wiggins.
<p/>I was surprised to find my companion speaking as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) were about to set out on a journey, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) had not said anything to me about it.
<p/>'' There was a small portmanteau in the room, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) pulled out and began to strap. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) was busily engaged at it when the cabman entered the room.
<p/>'' Just give me a help with this buckle, cabman,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) said, kneeling over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) task, and never turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) head.
<p/>The fellow came forward with a somewhat sullen, defiant air, and put down his (<font color='blue'><b>Wiggins</b></font>) hands to assist. At that instant there was a sharp click, the jangling of metal, and Sherlock Holmes sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) feet again.
<p/>Gentlemen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) cried, with flashing eyes, <div class="bookquote">``let me introduce you to Mr. Jefferson Hope, the murderer of Enoch Drebber and of Joseph Stangerson.
<p/>I have a vivid recollection of that instant, of Holmes' triumphant expression and the ring of his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) voice, of the cabman's dazed, savage face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) glared at the glittering handcuffs, which had appeared as if by magic upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) wrists.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' The whole thing occurred in a moment--so quickly that I had no time to realize it. For a second or two we might have been a group of statues.
<p/>Then, with an inarticulate roar of fury, the prisoner wrenched himself free from Holmes's grasp, and hurled himself through the window.
<p/>Woodwork and glass gave way before him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>); but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) got quite through, Gregson, Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) like so many staghounds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) was dragged back into the room, and then commenced a terrific conflict. So powerful and so fierce was he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), that the four of us were shaken off again and again.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) face and hands were terribly mangled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) passage through the glass, but loss of blood had no effect in diminishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) resistance.
<p/>It was not until Lestrade succeeded in getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) hand inside his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) neckcloth and half-strangling him (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) that we made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) realize that his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) struggles were of no avail; and even then we felt no security until we had pinioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) feet as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) hands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) appeared to have the convulsive strength of a man in an epileptic fit. That done, we rose to our feet breathless and panting.
<p/>'' We have his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) cab,'' said Sherlock Holmes. '' It will serve to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) to Scotland Yard. And now, gentlemen,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) continued, with a pleasant smile, <div class="bookquote">``we have reached the end of our little mystery.
<p/>You are very welcome to put any questions that you like to me now, and there is no danger that I will refuse to answer them.
<p/>IN the central portion of the great North American Continent there lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served as a barrier against the advance of civilisation.
<p/>From the Sierra Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>PART II. The Country of the Saints. CHAPTER I. ON THE GREAT ALKALI PLAIN. Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district.
<p/>There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged cañons; and there are enormous plains, which in winter are white with snow, and in summer are grey with the saline alkali dust.
<p/>It comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy valleys. They all preserve, however, the common characteristics of barrenness, inhospitality, and misery.
<p/>A band of Pawnees or of Blackfeet may occasionally traverse it in order to reach other hunting-grounds, but the hardiest of the braves are glad to lose sight of those awesome plains, and to find themselves once more upon their prairies.
<p/>The coyote skulks among the scrub, the buzzard flaps heavily through the air, and the clumsy grizzly bear lumbers through the dark ravines, and picks up such sustenance as it can amongst the rocks.
<p/>In the whole world there can be no more dreary view than that from the northern slope of the Sierra Blanco.
<p/>As far as the eye can reach stretches the great flat plain-land, all dusted over with patches of alkali, and intersected by clumps of the dwarfish chaparral bushes.
<p/>On the extreme verge of the horizon lie a long chain of mountain peaks, with their rugged summits flecked with snow.
<p/>There are no inhabitants of this land of despair. These are the sole dwellers in the wilderness. In this great stretch of country there is no sign of life, nor of anything appertaining to life.
<p/>Listen as one may, there is no shadow of a sound in all that mighty wilderness; nothing but silence--complete and heart-subduing silence.
<p/>There is no bird in the steel-blue heaven, no movement upon the dull, grey earth--above all, there is absolute silence. It has been said there is nothing appertaining to life upon the broad plain.
<p/>Looking down from the Sierra Blanco, one sees a pathway traced out across the desert, which winds away and is lost in the extreme distance.
<p/>Here and there there are scattered white objects which glisten in the sun, and stand out against the dull deposit of alkali.
<p/>That is hardly true. It is rutted with wheels and trodden down by the feet of many adventurers. Approach, and examine them!
<p/>They are bones: some large and coarse, others smaller and more delicate. The former have belonged to oxen, and the latter to men.
<p/>For fifteen hundred miles one may trace this ghastly caravan route by these scattered remains of those who had fallen by the wayside.
<p/>Looking down on this very scene, there stood upon the fourth of May, eighteen hundred and forty-seven, a solitary traveller. His (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) appearance was such that he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) might have been the very genius or demon of the region.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) face was lean and haggard, and the brown parchment-like skin was drawn tightly over the projecting bones; his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) long, brown hair and beard were all flecked and dashed with white; his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) eyes were sunken in his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) head, and burned with an unnatural lustre; while the hand which grasped his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) rifle was hardly more fleshy than that of a skeleton.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) stood, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) leaned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) weapon for support, and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) tall figure and the massive framework of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) bones suggested a wiry and vigorous constitution.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) gaunt face, however, and his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) clothes, which hung so baggily over his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) shrivelled limbs, proclaimed what it was that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) that senile and decrepit appearance.
<p/>An observer would have found it difficult to say whether he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) was nearer to forty or to sixty. The man was dying--dying from hunger and from thirst.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had toiled painfully down the ravine, and on to this little elevation, in the vain hope of seeing some signs of water.
<p/>Now the great salt plain stretched before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, and the distant belt of savage mountains, without a sign anywhere of plant or tree, which might indicate the presence of moisture.
<p/>North, and east, and west he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked with wild questioning eyes, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) realised that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanderings had come to an end, and that there, on that barren crag, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was about to die.
<p/>Why not here, as well as in a feather bed, twenty years hence,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seated himself in the shelter of a boulder.
<p/>Before sitting down, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had deposited upon the ground his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) useless rifle, and also a large bundle tied up in a grey shawl, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had carried slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) right shoulder.
<p/>It appeared to be somewhat too heavy for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength, for in lowering it, it came down on the ground with some little violence.
<p/>Instantly there broke from the grey parcel a little moaning cry, and from it there protruded a small, scared face, with very bright brown eyes, and two little speckled, dimpled fists.
<p/>In all that broad landscape there was no gleam of hope. '' '' You've hurt me!'' said a childish voice reproachfully.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unwrapped the grey shawl and extricated a pretty little girl of about five years of age, whose dainty shoes and smart pink frock with its little linen apron all bespoke a mother's care.
<p/>The child was pale and wan, but her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) healthy arms and legs showed that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had suffered less than her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) companion.
<p/>'' Have I though ,'' the man answered penitently, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't go for to do it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>'' How is it now?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered anxiously, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was still rubbing the towsy golden curls which covered the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head. ''
<p/>Kiss it and make it well,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) said, with perfect gravity, shoving -LSB-19-RSB- the injured part up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' That's what mother used to do.
<p/>Where's mother?'' '' Mother's gone. I guess you'll see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) before long.'' <div class="bookquote">``Gone, eh!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said the little girl. '' Funny, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't say good-bye
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) `most always did if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was just goin' over to Auntie's for tea, and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Auntie</b></font>)'s been away three days.
<p/>Say, it's awful dry, ain't it? Ain't there no water, nor nothing to eat?'' '' No, there ain't nothing, dearie. You'll just need to be patient awhile, and then you'll be all right.
<p/>It ain't easy to talk when your lips is like leather, but I guess I'd best let you know how the cards lie.
<p/>Put your head up agin me like that, and then you'll feel bullier. What's that you've got? '' <div class="bookquote">``Pretty things! fine things!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the little girl enthusiastically, holding up two glittering fragments of mica. '' When we goes back to home I'll give them to brother Bob.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You'll see prettier things than them soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man confidently. '' You just wait a bit. I was going to tell you though
<p/>--you remember when we left the river?'' '' Oh, yes.'' '' Well, we reckoned we'd strike another river soon, d'ye see.
<p/>Just except a little drop for the likes of you and--and--'' <div class="bookquote">``And you couldn't wash yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>interrupted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion gravely, staring up at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grimy visage.
<p/>But there was somethin' wrong; compasses, or map, or somethin', and it didn't turn up. Water ran out. '' No, nor drink.
<p/>And Mr. Bender, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bender</b></font>) was the fust to go, and then Indian Pete, and then Mrs. McGregor, and then Johnny Hones, and then, dearie, your mother.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then mother's a deader too,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried the little girl dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pinafore and sobbing bitterly. '' Yes, they all went except you and me.
<p/>Then I thought there was some chance of water in this direction, so I heaved you over my shoulder and we tramped it together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean that we are going to die too?''  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>asked the child, checking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sobs, and raising her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tear-stained face.
<p/>It don't seem as though we've improved matters. There's an almighty small chance for us now!'' '' I guess that's about the size of it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why didn't you say so before? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, laughing gleefully. '' You gave me such a fright. Why, of course, now as long as we die we'll be with mother again.
<p/>I'll bet she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) meets us at the door of Heaven with a big pitcher of water, and a lot of buckwheat cakes, hot, and toasted on both sides, like Bob and me was fond of.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you will, dearie.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And you too. I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) how awful good you've been. How long will it be first?''
<p/>In the blue vault of the heaven there had appeared three little specks which increased in size every moment, so rapidly did they approach.
<p/>They speedily resolved themselves into three large brown birds, which circled over the heads of the two wanderers, and then settled upon some rocks which overlooked them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't know--not very long. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man's eyes were fixed upon the northern horizon. They were buzzards, the vultures of the west, whose coming is the forerunner of death.
<p/>Cocks and hens,'' cried the little girl gleefully, pointing at their ill-omened forms, and clapping her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands to make them rise.
<p/>'' '' Say, did God make this country?'' <div class="bookquote">``In course He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did,''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companion, rather startled by this unexpected question.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) made the country down in Illinois, and He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) made the Missouri,'' the little girl continued. '' I guess somebody else made the country in these parts.
<p/>It's not nearly so well done. They forgot the water and the trees. '' '' What would ye think of offering up prayer?
<p/>'' the man asked diffidently. '' It ain't night yet,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered. '' It don't matter. It ain't quite regular, but He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) won't mind that
<p/>You say over them ones that you used to say every night in the waggon when we was on the Plains.''
<p/>, you bet. <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you say some yourself? ''  (<font color='red'><b>some the child</b></font>)</div>the child asked, with wondering eyes. '' I disremember them,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' I hain't said none since I was half the height o' that gun. I guess it's never too late. You say them out, and I'll stand by and come in on the choruses.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you'll need to kneel down, and me too,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) said, laying the shawl out for that purpose. '' You've got to put your hands up like this.
<p/>It makes you feel kind o' good. '' It was a strange sight had there been anything but the buzzards to see it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) chubby face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) haggard, angular visage were both turned up to the cloudless heaven in heartfelt entreaty to that dread being with whom they were face to face, while the two voices--the one thin and clear, the other deep and harsh--united in the entreaty for mercy and forgiveness.
<p/>The prayer finished, they resumed their seat in the shadow of the boulder until the child fell asleep, nestling upon the broad breast of her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) protector.
<p/>Side by side on the narrow shawl knelt the two wanderers, the little prattling child and the reckless, hardened adventurer. He (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>) watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) slumber for some time, but Nature proved to be too strong for him (<font color='blue'><b>adventurer</b></font>).
<p/>Slowly the eyelids drooped over the tired eyes, and the head sunk lower and lower upon the breast, until the man's grizzled beard was mixed with the gold tresses of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion, and both slept the same deep and dreamless slumber.
<p/>For three days and three nights he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had allowed himself neither rest nor repose. Had the wanderer remained awake for another half hour a strange sight would have met his (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Far away on the extreme verge of the alkali plain there rose up a little spray of dust, very slight at first, and hardly to be distinguished from the mists of the distance, but gradually growing higher and broader until it formed a solid, well-defined cloud.
<p/>This cloud continued to increase in size until it became evident that it could only be raised by a great multitude of moving creatures.
<p/>In more fertile spots the observer would have come to the conclusion that one of those great herds of bisons which graze upon the prairie land was approaching him (<font color='blue'><b>observer</b></font>).
<p/>As the whirl of dust drew nearer to the solitary bluff upon which the two castaways were reposing, the canvas-covered tilts of waggons and the figures of armed horsemen began to show up through the haze, and the apparition revealed itself as being a great caravan upon its journey for the West.
<p/>When the head of it had reached the base of the mountains, the rear was not yet visible on the horizon.
<p/>This was obviously impossible in these arid wilds. But what a caravan! Right across the enormous plain stretched the straggling array, waggons and carts, men on horseback, and men on foot.
<p/>Innumerable women who staggered along under burdens, and children who toddled beside the waggons or peeped out from under the white coverings.
<p/>This was evidently no ordinary party of immigrants, but rather some nomad people who had been compelled from stress of circumstances to seek themselves a new country.
<p/>There rose through the clear air a confused clattering and rumbling from this great mass of humanity, with the creaking of wheels and the neighing of horses.
<p/>At the head of the column there rode a score or more of grave ironfaced men, clad in sombre homespun garments and armed with rifles.
<p/>Loud as it was, it was not sufficient to rouse the two tired wayfarers above them. On reaching the base of the bluff they halted, and held a short council among themselves.
<p/>'' The wells are to the right, my brothers,'' said one, a hard-lipped, clean-shaven man with grizzly hair. '' To the right of the Sierra Blanco--so we shall reach the Rio Grande,'' said another.
<p/>'' Fear not for water,'' cried a third. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Grande</b></font>) who could draw it from the rocks will not now abandon His (<font color='blue'><b>Grande</b></font>) own chosen people.''
<p/>They were about to resume their journey when one of the youngest and keenest-eyed uttered an exclamation and pointed up at the rugged crag above them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Amen! Amen!''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>responded the whole party. From its summit there fluttered a little wisp of pink, showing up hard and bright against the grey rocks behind.
<p/>At the sight there was a general reining up of horses and unslinging of guns, while fresh horsemen came galloping up to reinforce the vanguard.
<p/>The word `Redskins' was on every lip. '' There can't be any number of Injuns here,'' said the elderly man who appeared to be in command.
<p/>'' We have passed the Pawnees, and there are no other tribes until we cross the great mountains.'' '' Shall I go forward and see, Brother Stangerson,'' asked one of the band.
<p/>'' And I,'' <div class="bookquote">``and I,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried a dozen voices. '' Leave your horses below and we will await you here,'' the Elder answered.
<p/>In a moment the young fellows had dismounted, fastened their horses, and were ascending the precipitous slope which led up to the object which had excited their curiosity.
<p/>The watchers from the plain below could see them flit from rock to rock until their figures stood out against the skyline.
<p/>They advanced rapidly and noiselessly, with the confidence and dexterity of practised scouts. The young man who had first given the alarm was leading them.
<p/>Suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) followers saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throw up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, as though overcome with astonishment, and on joining him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) they were affected in the same way by the sight which met their eyes.
<p/>On the little plateau which crowned the barren hill there stood a single giant boulder, and against this boulder there lay a tall man, long-bearded and hard-featured, but of an excessive thinness.
<p/>Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay a little child, with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) round white arms encircling his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brown sinewy neck, and her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) golden haired head resting upon the breast of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) velveteen tunic.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rosy lips were parted, showing the regular line of snow-white teeth within, and a playful smile played over her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) infantile features.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plump little white legs terminating in white socks and neat shoes with shining buckles, offered a strange contrast to the long shrivelled members of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion.
<p/>On the ledge of rock above this strange couple there stood three solemn buzzards, who, at the sight of the new comers uttered raucous screams of disappointment and flapped sullenly away.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) placid face and regular breathing showed that he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was fast asleep. The cries of the foul birds awoke the two sleepers who stared about -LSB-20-RSB- them in bewilderment.
<p/>The man staggered to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet and looked down upon the plain which had been so desolate when sleep had overtaken him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and which was now traversed by this enormous body of men and of beasts.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face assumed an expression of incredulity as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gazed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boney hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes. '' This is what they call delirium, I guess,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered.
<p/>The child stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), holding on to the skirt of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat, and said nothing but looked all round her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood.
<p/>One of them seized the little girl, and hoisted her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, while two others supported her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gaunt companion, and assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) towards the waggons.
<p/>The rescuing party were speedily able to convince the two castaways that their appearance was no delusion. '' My name is John Ferrier,'' the wanderer explained; <div class="bookquote">``me and that little un are all that's left o' twenty-one people.
<p/>The rest is all dead o' thirst and hunger away down in the south.''  (<font color='red'><b>the wanderer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) your child? ''  (<font color='red'><b>someone</b></font>)</div>asked someone.
<p/>'' I guess she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is now,'' the other cried, defiantly; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s mine 'cause I saved her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). No man will take her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s Lucy Ferrier from this day on. Who are you, though? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued, glancing with curiosity at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stalwart, sunburned rescuers; <div class="bookquote">``there seems to be a powerful lot of ye.''
 (<font color='red'><b>rescuers</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nigh upon ten thousand,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>said one of the young men; <div class="bookquote">``we are the persecuted children of God--the chosen of the Angel Merona.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I never heard tell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>the wanderer</b></font>)</div>said the wanderer. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) appears to have chosen a fair crowd of ye.''
<p/>We are of those who believe in those sacred writings, drawn in Egyptian letters on plates of beaten gold, which were handed unto the holy Joseph Smith at Palmyra.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not jest at that which is sacred,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other sternly. '' We have come from Nauvoo, in the State of Illinois, where we had founded our temple.
<p/>We have come to seek a refuge from the violent man and from the godless, even though it be the heart of the desert.
<p/>'' The name of Nauvoo evidently recalled recollections to John Ferrier. '' I see,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you are the Mormons.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We are the Mormons,''  (<font color='red'><b>companions</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) companions with one voice.
<p/>'' And where are you going?'' <div class="bookquote">``We do not know. The hand of God is leading us under the person of our Prophet.
<p/>They had reached the base of the hill by this time, and were surrounded by crowds of the pilgrims--pale-faced meek-looking women, strong laughing children, and anxious earnest-eyed men.
<p/>Many were the cries of astonishment and of commiseration which arose from them when they perceived the youth of one of the strangers and the destitution of the other.
<p/>Their escort did not halt, however, but pushed on, followed by a great crowd of Mormons, until they reached a waggon, which was conspicuous for its great size and for the gaudiness and smartness of its appearance.
<p/>You must come before him (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Their</b></font>) shall say what is to be done with you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>Six horses were yoked to it, whereas the others were furnished with two, or, at most, four a-piece.
<p/>Beside the driver there sat a man who could not have been more than thirty years of age, but whose massive head and resolute expression marked him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) as a leader.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was reading a brown-backed volume, but as the crowd approached he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) laid it aside, and listened attentively to an account of the episode.
<p/>If we take you with us,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) said, in solemn words, <div class="bookquote">``it can only be as believers in our own creed.
<p/>Better far that your bones should bleach in this wilderness than that you should prove to be that little speck of decay which in time corrupts the whole fruit.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) turned to the two castaways. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We shall have no wolves in our fold. Will you come with us on these terms?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Guess I'll come with you on any terms,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Ferrier/Ferrier/JOHN FERRIER</b></font>)</div>said Ferrier, with such emphasis that the grave Elders could not restrain a smile.
<p/>The leader alone retained his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) stern, impressive expression. <div class="bookquote">``Take him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>), Brother Stangerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``give him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) food and drink, and the child likewise.
<p/>Let it be your task also to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) our holy creed. We have delayed long enough. Forward! On, on to Zion!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>On, on to Zion!'' cried the crowd of Mormons, and the words rippled down the long caravan, passing from mouth to mouth until they died away in a dull murmur in the far distance.
<p/>With a cracking of whips and a creaking of wheels the great waggons got into motion, and soon the whole caravan was winding along once more.
<p/>The Elder to whose care the two waifs had been committed, led them to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elder</b></font>) waggon, where a meal was already awaiting them.
<p/>'' '' You shall remain here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Elder</b></font>) said. '' In a few days you will have recovered from your fatigues. In the meantime, remember that now and for ever you are of our religion.
<p/>Brigham Young has said it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) has spoken with the voice of Joseph Smith, which is the voice of God.
<p/>THIS is not the place to commemorate the trials and privations endured by the immigrant Mormons before they came to their final haven.
<p/>From the shores of the Mississippi to the western slopes of the Rocky Mountains they had struggled on with a constancy almost unparalleled in history.
<p/>The savage man, and the savage beast, hunger, thirst, fatigue, and disease--every impediment which Nature could place in the way, had all been overcome with Anglo-Saxon tenacity.
<p/>'' CHAPTER II. THE FLOWER OF UTAH. Yet the long journey and the accumulated terrors had shaken the hearts of the stoutest among them.
<p/>There was not one who did not sink upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees in heartfelt prayer when they saw the broad valley of Utah bathed in the sunlight beneath them, and learned from the lips of their leader that this was the promised land, and that these virgin acres were to be theirs for evermore.
<p/>Young speedily proved himself to be a skilful administrator as well as a resolute chief. Maps were drawn and charts prepared, in which the future city was sketched out.
<p/>All around farms were apportioned and allotted in proportion to the standing of each individual. The tradesman was put to his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) trade and the artisan to his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) calling.
<p/>In the country there was draining and hedging, planting and clearing, until the next summer saw the whole country golden with the wheat crop.
<p/>In the town streets and squares sprang up, as if by magic. Everything prospered in the strange settlement. Above all, the great temple which they had erected in the centre of the city grew ever taller and larger.
<p/>From the first blush of dawn until the closing of the twilight, the clatter of the hammer and the rasp of the saw was never absent from the monument which the immigrants erected to Him (<font color='blue'><b>immigrants</b></font>) who had led them safe through many dangers.
<p/>The two castaways, John Ferrier and the little girl who had shared his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) fortunes and had been adopted as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) daughter, accompanied the Mormons to the end of their great pilgrimage.
<p/>Little Lucy Ferrier was borne along pleasantly enough in Elder Stangerson's waggon, a retreat which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) shared with the Mormon's three wives and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) son, a headstrong forward boy of twelve.
<p/>Having rallied, with the elasticity of childhood, from the shock caused by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) mother's death, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) soon became a pet with the women, and reconciled herself to this new life in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) moving canvas-covered home.
<p/>So rapidly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) gain the esteem of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) new companions, that when they reached the end of their wanderings, it was unanimously agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) should be provided with as large and as fertile a tract of land as any of the settlers, with the exception of Young himself, and of Stangerson, Kemball, Johnston, and Drebber, who were the four principal Elders.
<p/>On the farm thus acquired John Ferrier built himself a substantial log-house, which received so many additions in succeeding years that it grew into a roomy villa.
<p/>In the meantime Ferrier having recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) privations, distinguished himself as a useful guide and an indefatigable hunter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was a man of a practical turn of mind, keen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) dealings and skilful with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) hands.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) iron constitution enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) to work morning and evening at improving and tilling his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) lands. Hence it came about that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) farm and all that belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) prospered exceedingly.
<p/>In three years he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was better off than his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) neighbours, in six he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was well-to-do, in nine he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was rich, and in twelve there were not half a dozen men in the whole of Salt Lake City who could compare with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>).
<p/>From the great inland sea to the distant Wahsatch Mountains there was no name better known than that of John Ferrier.
<p/>There was one way and only one in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) offended the susceptibilities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) co-religionists. No argument or persuasion could ever induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) to set up a female establishment after the manner of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) companions.
<p/>There were some who accused him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) of lukewarmness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) adopted religion, and others who put it down to greed of wealth and reluctance to incur expense.
<p/>Others, again, spoke of some early love affair, and of a fair-haired girl who had pined away on the shores of the Atlantic.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) never gave reasons for this persistent refusal, but contented himself by resolutely and inflexibly adhering to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) determination. Whatever the reason, Ferrier remained strictly celibate.
<p/>In every other respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) conformed to the religion of the young settlement, and gained the name of being an orthodox and straight-walking man.
<p/>The keen air of the mountains and the balsamic odour of the pine trees took the place of nurse and mother to the young girl.
<p/>Lucy Ferrier grew up within the log-house, and assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) adopted father in all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) undertakings. As year succeeded to year she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) grew taller and stronger, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) cheek more rudy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) step more elastic.
<p/>Many a wayfarer upon the high road which ran by Ferrier's farm felt long-forgotten thoughts revive in their mind as they watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) lithe girlish figure tripping through the wheatfields, or met her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) mounted upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) father's mustang, and managing it with all the ease and grace of a true child of the West.
<p/>So the bud blossomed into a flower, and the year which saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) father the richest of the farmers left her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) as fair a specimen of American girlhood as could be found in the whole Pacific slope.
<p/>It was not the father, however, who first discovered that the child had developed into the woman. It seldom is in such cases.
<p/>Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of a voice or the touch of a hand sets her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart thrilling within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) learns, with a mixture of pride and of fear, that a new and a larger nature has awoken within her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>There are few who cannot recall that day and remember the one little incident which heralded the dawn of a new life.
<p/>In the case of Lucy Ferrier the occasion was serious enough in itself, apart from its future influence on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) destiny and that of many besides.
<p/>It was a warm June morning, and the Latter Day Saints were as busy as the bees whose hive they have chosen for their emblem.
<p/>That mysterious change is too subtle and too gradual to be measured by dates. In the fields and in the streets rose the same hum of human industry.
<p/>Down the dusty high roads defiled long streams of heavily-laden mules, all heading to the west, for the gold fever had broken out in California, and the Overland Route lay through the City of the Elect.
<p/>There, too, were droves of sheep and bullocks coming in from the outlying pasture lands, and trains of tired immigrants, men and horses equally weary of their interminable journey.
<p/>Through all this motley assemblage, threading her (<font color='blue'><b>droves</b></font>) way with the skill of an accomplished rider, there galloped Lucy Ferrier, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) fair face flushed with the exercise and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) long chestnut hair floating out behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) had a commission from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) father in the City, and was dashing in as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) had done many a time before, with all the fearlessness of youth, thinking only of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) task and how it was to be performed.
<p/>The travel-stained adventurers gazed after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) in astonishment, and even the unemotional Indians, journeying in with their pelties, relaxed their accustomed stoicism as they marvelled at the beauty of the pale-faced maiden.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) had reached the outskirts of the city when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) found the road blocked by a great drove of cattle, driven by a half-dozen wild-looking herdsmen from the plains.
<p/>Scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) got fairly into it, however, before the beasts closed in behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) found herself completely imbedded in the moving stream of fierce-eyed, long-horned bullocks.
<p/>Accustomed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was to deal with cattle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was not alarmed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) situation, but took advantage of every opportunity to urge her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) horse on in the hopes of pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) way through the cavalcade.
<p/>Unfortunately the horns of one of the creatures, either by accident or design, came in violent contact with the flank of the mustang, and excited it to madness.
<p/>In an instant it reared up upon its hind legs with a snort of rage, and pranced and tossed in a way that would have unseated any but a most skilful rider.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) impatience she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) endeavoured to pass this obstacle by pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) horse into what appeared to be a gap. The situation was full of peril.
<p/>It was all that the girl could do to keep herself in the saddle, yet a slip would mean a terrible death under the hoofs of the unwieldy and terrified animals.
<p/>Every plunge of the excited horse brought it against the horns again, and goaded it to fresh madness. Unaccustomed to sudden emergencies, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head began to swim, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grip upon the bridle to relax.
<p/>Choked by the rising cloud of dust and by the steam from the struggling creatures, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might have abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) efforts in despair, but for a kindly voice at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) elbow which assured her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of assistance.
<p/>At the same moment a sinewy brown hand caught the frightened horse by the curb, and forcing a way through the drove, soon brought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to the outskirts.
<p/>'' You're not hurt, I hope, miss,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) preserver, respectfully. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked up at his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dark, fierce face, and laughed saucily.
<p/>I'm awful frightened,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, naively; <div class="bookquote">``whoever would have thought that Poncho would have been so scared by a lot of cows?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a tall, savage-looking young fellow, mounted on a powerful roan horse, and clad in the rough dress of a hunter, with a long rifle slung over his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Thank God you kept your seat,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the other said earnestly. '' I guess you are the daughter of John Ferrier,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) remarked, <div class="bookquote">``I saw you ride down from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) house.
<p/>When you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>), ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) remembers the Jefferson Hopes of St. Louis. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>)'s the same Ferrier, my father and he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) were pretty thick.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you better come and ask yourself? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) asked, demurely. The young fellow seemed pleased at the suggestion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) dark eyes sparkled with pleasure.
<p/>I'll do so,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``we've been in the mountains for two months, and are not over and above in visiting condition.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) must take us as he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) finds us.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) has a good deal to thank you for, and so have I,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>)'s awful fond of me.
<p/>If those cows had jumped on me he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>)'d have never got over it.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Neither would I,'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) companion. ''
<p/>You! Well, I don't see that it would make much matter to you, anyhow. You ain't even a friend of ours.
<p/>'' The young hunter's dark face grew so gloomy over this remark that Lucy Ferrier laughed aloud. '' There, I didn't mean that,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``of course, you are a friend now.
<p/>You must come and see us. Now I must push along, or father won't trust me with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) business any more.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) wheeled her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) mustang round, gave it a cut with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) riding-whip, and darted away down the broad road in a rolling cloud of dust.
<p/>Good-bye!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) broad sombrero, and bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) little hand. Young Jefferson Hope rode on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) companions, gloomy and taciturn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) and they had been among the Nevada Mountains prospecting for silver, and were returning to Salt Lake City in the hope of raising capital enough to work some lodes which they had discovered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) had been as keen as any of them upon the business until this sudden incident had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) thoughts into another channel.
<p/>The sight of the fair young girl, as frank and wholesome as the Sierra breezes, had stirred his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) volcanic, untamed heart to its very depths.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had vanished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) realized that a crisis had come in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) life, and that neither silver speculations nor any other questions could ever be of such importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) as this new and all-absorbing one.
<p/>The love which had sprung up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) heart was not the sudden, changeable fancy of a boy, but rather the wild, fierce passion of a man of strong will and imperious temper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) swore in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not fail in this if human effort and human perseverance could render him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) successful.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called on John Ferrier that night, and many times again, until his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) face was a familiar one at the farm-house.
<p/>John, cooped up in the valley, and absorbed in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) work, had had little chance of learning the news of the outside world during the last twelve years.
<p/>All this Jefferson Hope was able to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>), and in a style which interested Lucy as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been a pioneer in California, and could narrate many a strange tale of fortunes made and fortunes lost in those wild, halcyon days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been accustomed to succeed in all that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) undertook. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been a scout too, and a trapper, a silver explorer, and a ranchman.
<p/>Wherever stirring adventures were to be had, Jefferson Hope had been there in search of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) soon became a favourite with the old farmer, who spoke eloquently of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) virtues.
<p/>On such occasions, Lucy was silent, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) blushing cheek and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bright, happy eyes, showed only too clearly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) young heart was no longer her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) honest father may not have observed these symptoms, but they were assuredly not thrown away upon the man who had won her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) affections.
<p/>It was a summer evening when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came galloping down the road and pulled up at the gate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was at the doorway, and came down to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I am off, Lucy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) two hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and gazing tenderly down into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) face; <div class="bookquote">``I won't ask you to come with me now, but will you be ready to come when I am here again?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw the bridle over the fence and strode up the pathway. '' '' And when will that be? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) asked, blushing and laughing.
<p/>'' A couple of months at the outside. I will come and claim you then, my darling. There's no one who can stand between us.''
<p/>'' And how about father? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) asked. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has given his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) consent, provided we get these mines working all right.
<p/>Oh, well; of course, if you and father have arranged it all, there's no more to be said,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) whispered, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) cheek against his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) broad breast.
<p/>I have no fear on that head.'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, hoarsely, stooping and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). '' It is settled, then.
<p/>The longer I stay, the harder it will be to go. They are waiting for me at the cañon. Good-bye, my own darling--good-bye.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tore himself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke, and, flinging himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) horse, galloped furiously away, never even looking round, as though afraid that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) resolution might fail him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took one glance at what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was leaving.
<p/>In two months you shall see me. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stood at the gate, gazing after him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) until he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) vanished from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sight.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) walked back into the house, the happiest girl in all Utah. CHAPTER III. JOHN FERRIER TALKS WITH THE PROPHET.
<p/>John Ferrier's heart was sore within him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) thought of the young man's return, and of the impending loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) adopted child.
<p/>THREE weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) comrades had departed from Salt Lake City. Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) bright and happy face reconciled him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) to the arrangement more than any argument could have done.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) had always determined, deep down in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) resolute heart, that nothing would ever induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) to allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) daughter to wed a Mormon.
<p/>Such a marriage he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a disgrace. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that one point he (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) was inflexible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) had to seal his (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) mouth on the subject, however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter in those days in the Land of the Saints.
<p/>Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly dared only whisper their religious opinions with bated breath, lest something which fell from their lips might be misconstrued, and bring down a swift retribution upon them.
<p/>Not the Inquisition of Seville, nor the German Vehm-gericht, nor the Secret Societies of Italy, were ever able to put a more formidable machinery in motion than that which cast a cloud over the State of Utah.
<p/>The victims of persecution had now turned persecutors on their own account, and persecutors of the most terrible description. Its invisibility, and the mystery which was attached to it, made this organization doubly terrible.
<p/>The man who held out against the Church vanished away, and none knew whither he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone or what had befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children awaited him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at home, but no father ever returned to tell them how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had fared at the hands of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) secret judges.
<p/>A rash word or a hasty act was followed by annihilation, and yet none knew what the nature might be of this terrible power which was suspended over them.
<p/>No wonder that men went about in fear and trembling, and that even in the heart of the wilderness they dared not whisper the doubts which oppressed them.
<p/>At first this vague and terrible power was exercised only upon the recalcitrants who, having embraced the Mormon faith, wished afterwards to pervert or to abandon it.
<p/>It appeared to be omniscient and omnipotent, and yet was neither seen nor heard. Soon, however, it took a wider range.
<p/>The supply of adult women was running short, and polygamy without a female population on which to draw was a barren doctrine indeed.
<p/>Strange rumours began to be bandied about--rumours of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had never been seen.
<p/>Fresh women appeared in the harems of the Elders--women who pined and wept, and bore upon their faces the traces of an unextinguishable horror.
<p/>Belated wanderers upon the mountains spoke of gangs of armed men, masked, stealthy, and noiseless, who flitted by them in the darkness.
<p/>These tales and rumours took substance and shape, and were corroborated and re-corroborated, until they resolved themselves into a definite name.
<p/>To this day, in the lonely ranches of the West, the name of the Danite Band, or the Avenging Angels, is a sinister and an ill-omened one.
<p/>Fuller knowledge of the organization which produced such terrible results served to increase rather than to lessen the horror which it inspired in the minds of men.
<p/>The names of the participators in the deeds of blood and violence done under the name of religion were kept profoundly secret.
<p/>The very friend to whom you communicated your misgivings as to the Prophet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) mission, might be one of those who would come forth at night with fire and sword to exact a terrible reparation.
<p/>None knew who belonged to this ruthless society. Hence every man feared his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neighbour, and none spoke of the things which were nearest his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart.
<p/>One fine morning, John Ferrier was about to set out to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) wheatfields, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) heard the click of the latch, and, looking through the window, saw a stout, sandy-haired, middle-aged man coming up the pathway.
<p/>Full of trepidation--for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that such a visit boded him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little good--Ferrier ran to the door to greet the Mormon chief.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) heart leapt to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) mouth, for this was none other than the great Brigham Young himself. The latter, however, received his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) salutations coldly, and followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) with a stern face into the sitting-room.
<p/>Brother Ferrier,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) said, taking a seat, and eyeing the farmer keenly from under his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) light-coloured eyelashes, <div class="bookquote">``the true believers have been good friends to you.
<p/>We picked you up when you were starving in the desert, we shared our food with you, led you safe to the Chosen Valley, gave you a goodly share of land, and allowed you to wax rich under our protection.
<p/>In return for all this we asked but one condition: that was, that you should embrace the true faith, and conform in every way to its usages.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>Is not this so?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is so,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Ferrier/Ferrier/JOHN FERRIER</b></font>)</div>answered John Ferrier. '' This you promised to do, and this, if common report says truly, you have neglected.''
<p/>'' And how have I neglected it?'' asked Ferrier, throwing out his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) hands in expostulation. '' Have I not given to the common fund?
<p/>Have I not attended at the Temple? Have I not--?'' <div class="bookquote">``Where are your wives? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Young/Brigham Young</b></font>)</div>asked Young, looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>). ''
<p/>Call them in, that I may greet them.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is true that I have not married,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Ferrier/Ferrier/JOHN FERRIER</b></font>)</div>Ferrier answered. '' But women were few, and there were many who had better claims than I.
<p/>I was not a lonely man: I had my daughter to attend to my wants. '' <div class="bookquote">``It is of that daughter that I would speak to you,''  (<font color='red'><b>the leader</b></font>)</div>said the leader of the Mormons.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has grown to be the flower of Utah, and has found favour in the eyes of many who are high in the land.
<p/>'' '' John Ferrier groaned internally. '' There are stories of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) which I would fain disbelieve--stories that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is sealed to some Gentile.
<p/>This must be the gossip of idle tongues. What is the thirteenth rule in the code of the sainted Joseph Smith? '
<p/>Let every maiden of the true faith marry one of the elect; for if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wed a Gentile, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) commits a grievous sin.'
<p/>This being so, it is impossible that you, who profess the holy creed, should suffer your daughter to violate it. ''
<p/>John Ferrier made no answer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) played nervously with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) riding-whip. '' Upon this one point your whole faith shall be tested--so it has been decided in the Sacred Council of Four.
<p/>The girl is young, and we would not have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wed grey hairs , neither would we deprive her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) of all choice.
<p/>Stangerson has a son, and Drebber has a son, and either of them would gladly welcome your daughter to their house.
<p/>We Elders have many heifers, -LSB-29-RSB- but our children must also be provided. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) choose between them. They are young and rich, and of the true faith.
<p/>What say you to that?'' Ferrier remained silent for some little time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) brows knitted. '' You will give us time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) said at last.
<p/>'' My daughter is very young--she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is scarce of an age to marry.'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shall have a month to choose,'' said Young, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) seat.
<p/>'' At the end of that time she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) shall give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) answer. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was passing through the door, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) turned, with flushed face and flashing eyes.
<p/>It were better for you, John Ferrier,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) thundered, <div class="bookquote">``that you and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) were now lying blanched skeletons upon the Sierra Blanco, than that you should put your weak wills against the orders of the Holy Four!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a threatening gesture of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) turned from the door, and Ferrier heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) heavy step scrunching along the shingly path.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was still sitting with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) elbows upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) knees, considering how he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) should broach the matter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) daughter when a soft hand was laid upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>), and looking up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) standing beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>).
<p/>'' One glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) pale, frightened face showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had heard what had passed. '' I could not help it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) said, in answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) look.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you scare yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) answered, drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>), and passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) broad, rough hand caressingly over her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) chestnut hair.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) voice rang through the house. Oh, father, father, what shall we do?'' '' We'll fix it up somehow or another.
<p/>You don't find your fancy kind o' lessening for this chap, do you? '' A sob and a squeeze of his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) hand was her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) only answer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s a likely lad, and he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s a Christian, which is more than these folk here, in spite o' all their praying and preaching.
<p/>There's a party starting for Nevada to-morrow, and I'll manage to send him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) a message letting him (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) know the hole we are in.
<p/>'' No; of course not. I shouldn't care to hear you say you did. If I know anything o' that young man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'ll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs.
<p/>'' Lucy laughed through her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tears at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father's description. '' When he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will advise us for the best.
<p/>But it is for you that I am frightened, dear. One hears--one hears such dreadful stories about those who oppose the Prophet: something terrible always happens to them.''
<p/>'' But we haven't opposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>) yet,'' her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father answered. '' It will be time to look out for squalls when we do.
<p/>We have a clear month before us; at the end of that, I guess we had best shin out of Utah.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Leave Utah!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That's about the size of it.'' '' But the farm?'' <div class="bookquote">``We will raise as much as we can in money, and let the rest go.
<p/>To tell the truth, Lucy, it isn't the first time I have thought of doing it. I don't care about knuckling under to any man, as these folk do to their darned prophet.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) comes browsing about this farm, he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) might chance to run up against a charge of buckshot travelling in the opposite direction.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I'm a free-born American, and it's all new to me. Guess I'm too old to learn. '' But they won't let us leave,'' his (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) daughter objected.
<p/>In the meantime, don't you fret yourself, my dearie, and don't get your eyes swelled up, else he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>)'ll be walking into me when he (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) sees you.
<p/>'' Wait till Jefferson comes, and we'll soon manage that. There's nothing to be afeared about, and there's no danger at all.
<p/>John Ferrier uttered these consoling remarks in a very confident tone, but she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not help observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) paid unusual care to the fastening of the doors that night, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) carefully cleaned and loaded the rusty old shotgun which hung upon the wall of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) bedroom.
<p/>ON the morning which followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) interview with the Mormon Prophet, John Ferrier went in to Salt Lake City, and having found his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) acquaintance, who was bound for the Nevada Mountains, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) entrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) message to Jefferson Hope.
<p/>In it he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) told the young man of the imminent danger which threatened them, and how necessary it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) should return.
<p/>'' CHAPTER IV. A FLIGHT FOR LIFE. Having done thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) felt easier in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) mind, and returned home with a lighter heart.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) approached his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) farm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was surprised to see a horse hitched to each of the posts of the gate.
<p/>Still more surprised was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) on entering to find two young men in possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) sitting-room. One, with a long pale face, was leaning back in the rocking-chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) feet cocked up upon the stove.
<p/>The other, a bull-necked youth with coarse bloated features, was standing in front of the window with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) pocket, whistling a popular hymn.
<p/>Both of them nodded to Ferrier as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) entered, and the one in the rocking-chair commenced the conversation. '' Maybe you don't know us,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) said.
<p/>This here is the son of Elder Drebber, and I'm Joseph Stangerson, who travelled with you in the desert when the Lord stretched out His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hand and gathered you into the true fold.
<p/>As He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will all the nations in His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own good time,'' said the other in a nasal voice; <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) grindeth slowly but exceeding small.
<p/>We have come,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>continued Stangerson, <div class="bookquote">``at the advice of our fathers to solicit the hand of your daughter for whichever of us may seem good to you and to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).
<p/>As I have but four wives and Brother Drebber here has seven, it appears to me that my claim is the stronger one.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Stangerson/Mr. Joseph Stangerson/Joseph Stangerson</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, nay, Brother Stangerson,''  (<font color='red'><b>John Ferrier/Ferrier/JOHN FERRIER</b></font>)</div>cried the other; <div class="bookquote">``the question is not how many wives we have, but how many we can keep.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>John Ferrier/Ferrier/JOHN FERRIER</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' John Ferrier bowed coldly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) had guessed who his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) visitors were. '' My father has now given over his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mills to me, and I am the richer man.''
<p/>'' But my prospects are better,'' said the other, warmly. '' When the Lord removes my father, I shall have his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) tanning yard and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) leather factory.
<p/>Then I am your elder, and am higher in the Church. '' <div class="bookquote">``It will be for the maiden to decide,''  (<font color='red'><b>Drebber/Mr. Drebber</b></font>)</div>rejoined young Drebber, smirking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) own reflection in the glass.
<p/>During this dialogue, John Ferrier had stood fuming in the doorway, hardly able to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) riding-whip from the backs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) two visitors.
<p/>Look here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) said at last, striding up to them, <div class="bookquote">``when my daughter summons you, you can come, but until then I don't want to see your faces again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We will leave it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) decision. '' '' '' The two young Mormons stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) in amazement.
<p/>In their eyes this competition between them for the maiden's hand was the highest of honours both to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father.
<p/>'' There are two ways out of the room,'' cried Ferrier; <div class="bookquote">``there is the door, and there is the window. Which do you care to use?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) brown face looked so savage, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) gaunt hands so threatening, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) visitors sprang to their feet and beat a hurried retreat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>John Ferrier/Ferrier/JOHN FERRIER</b></font>)</div>The old farmer followed them to the door. <div class="bookquote">``Let me know when you have settled which it is to be,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) said, sardonically.
<p/>'' You shall smart for this!'' Stangerson cried, white with rage. '' You have defied the Prophet and the Council of Four.
<p/>You shall rue it to the end of your days.'' '' The hand of the Lord shall be heavy upon you,'' cried young Drebber; <div class="bookquote">``He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) will arise and smite you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Drebber/Mr. Drebber</b></font>)</div><p/>Then I'll start the smiting,'' exclaimed Ferrier furiously, and would have rushed upstairs for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) gun had not Lucy seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) by the arm and restrained him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>).
<p/>'' Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) could escape from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), the clatter of horses' hoofs told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) that they were beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) reach. ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) exclaimed, wiping the perspiration from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) forehead; <div class="bookquote">``I would sooner see you in your grave, my girl, than the wife of either of them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The young canting rascals! '' '' And so should I, father,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answered, with spirit; <div class="bookquote">``but Jefferson will soon be here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes. It will not be long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) comes. The sooner the better, for we do not know what their next move may be.
<p/>It was, indeed, high time that someone capable of giving advice and help should come to the aid of the sturdy old farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) adopted daughter.
<p/>In the whole history of the settlement there had never been such a case of rank disobedience to the authority of the Elders.
<p/>'' If minor errors were punished so sternly, what would be the fate of this arch rebel. Ferrier knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) wealth and position would be of no avail to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>).
<p/>Others as well known and as rich as himself had been spirited away before now, and their goods given over to the Church.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was a brave man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) trembled at the vague, shadowy terrors which hung over him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>). Any known danger he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) could face with a firm lip, but this suspense was unnerving.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) fears from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) daughter, however, and affected to make light of the whole matter, though she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was ill at ease.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) expected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) would receive some message or remonstrance from Young as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) conduct, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was not mistaken, though it came in an unlooked-for manner.
<p/>Upon rising next morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) found, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) surprise, a small square of paper pinned on to the coverlet of his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) bed just over his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) chest.
<p/>On it was printed, in bold straggling letters:-- <div class="bookquote">``Twenty-nine days are given you for amendment, and then-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The dash was more fear-inspiring than any threat could have been.
<p/>How this warning came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) room puzzled John Ferrier sorely, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) servants slept in an outhouse, and the doors and windows had all been secured.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) crumpled the paper up and said nothing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) daughter, but the incident struck a chill into his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) heart. The twenty-nine days were evidently the balance of the month which Young had promised.
<p/>The hand which fastened that pin might have struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) to the heart, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) could never have known who had slain him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>).
<p/>What strength or courage could avail against an enemy armed with such mysterious powers? Still more shaken was he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) next morning.
<p/>They had sat down to their breakfast when Lucy with a cry of surprise pointed upwards. In the centre of the ceiling was scrawled, with a burned stick apparently, the number 28.
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) daughter it was unintelligible, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) did not enlighten her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). That night he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) sat up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) gun and kept watch and ward.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) saw and he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) heard nothing, and yet in the morning a great 27 had been painted upon the outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) door.
<p/>Thus day followed day; and as sure as morning came he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) unseen enemies had kept their register, and had marked up in some conspicuous position how many days were still left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) out of the month of grace.
<p/>Sometimes the fatal numbers appeared upon the walls, sometimes upon the floors, occasionally they were on small placards stuck upon the garden gate or the railings.
<p/>With all his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) vigilance John Ferrier could not discover whence these daily warnings proceeded. A horror which was almost superstitious came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) at the sight of them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) became haggard and restless, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) eyes had the troubled look of some hunted creature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) had but one hope in life now, and
<p/>that was for the arrival of the young hunter from Nevada. Twenty had changed to fifteen and fifteen to ten, but there was no news of the absentee.
<p/>Whenever a horseman clattered down the road, or a driver shouted at his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) team, the old farmer hurried to the gate thinking that help had arrived at last.
<p/>At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) saw five give way to four and that again to three, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) lost heart, and abandoned all hope of escape.
<p/>One by one the numbers dwindled down, and still there came no sign of him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>). Single-handed, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) limited knowledge of the mountains which surrounded the settlement, he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) was powerless.
<p/>The more-frequented roads were strictly watched and guarded, and none could pass along them without an order from the Council. Turn which way he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) would, there appeared to be no avoiding the blow which hung over him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>).
<p/>Yet the old man never wavered in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolution to part with life itself before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) consented to what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) regarded as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter's dishonour.
<p/>That morning had shown the figure 2 upon the wall of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house, and the next day would be the last of the allotted time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sitting alone one evening pondering deeply over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) troubles, and searching vainly for some way out of them. What was to happen then?
<p/>All manner of vague and terrible fancies filled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imagination. And his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter--what was to become of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone?
<p/>Was there no escape from the invisible network which was drawn all round them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sank his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head upon the table and sobbed at the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own impotence.
<p/>What was that? In the silence he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard a gentle scratching sound--low, but very distinct in the quiet of the night.
<p/>It came from the door of the house. Ferrier crept into the hall and listened intently. There was a pause for a few moments, and then the low insidious sound was repeated.
<p/>Someone was evidently tapping very gently upon one of the panels of the door. Was it some midnight assassin who had come to carry out the murderous orders of the secret tribunal?
<p/>Or was it some agent who was marking up that the last day of grace had arrived. John Ferrier felt that instant death would be better than the suspense which shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) nerves and chilled his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Springing forward he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) drew the bolt and threw the door open. Outside all was calm and quiet. The night was fine, and the stars were twinkling brightly overhead.
<p/>The little front garden lay before the farmer's eyes bounded by the fence and gate, but neither there nor on the road was any human being to be seen.
<p/>With a sigh of relief, Ferrier looked to right and to left, until happening to glance straight down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) own feet he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) saw to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) astonishment a man lying flat upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) face upon the ground, with arms and legs all asprawl.
<p/>So unnerved was he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) at the sight that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) leaned up against the wall with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) throat to stifle his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) inclination to call out.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) first thought was that the prostrate figure was that of some wounded or dying man, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw it writhe along the ground and into the hall with the rapidity and noiselessness of a serpent.
<p/>Once within the house the man sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet, closed the door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and resolute expression of Jefferson Hope.
<p/>'' Good God!'' gasped John Ferrier. '' How you scared me! Whatever made you come in like that.'' <div class="bookquote">``Give me food,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>the other said, hoarsely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) flung himself upon the -LSB-21-RSB- cold meat and bread which were still lying upon the table from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) host's supper, and devoured it voraciously.
<p/>'' I have had no time for bite or sup for eight-and-forty hours. '' '' Does Lucy bear up well? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) asked, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) had satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) hunger.
<p/>'' Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) does not know the danger,'' her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father answered. '' That is well. The house is watched on every side.
<p/>That is why I crawled my way up to it. They may be darned sharp, but they're not quite sharp enough to catch a Washoe hunter.
<p/>'' John Ferrier felt a different man now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) realized that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) had a devoted ally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) seized the young man's leathery hand and wrung it cordially.
<p/>'' You're a man to be proud of,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' There are not many who would come to share our danger and our troubles.''
<p/>I have a respect for you, but if you were alone in this business I'd think twice before I put my head into such a hornet's nest.
<p/>'' You've hit it there, pard,'' the young hunter answered. '' It's Lucy that brings me here, and before harm comes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
<p/>I guess there will be one less o' the Hope family in Utah. '' '' What are we to do?'' <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow is your last day, and unless you act to-night you are lost.
<p/>I have a mule and two horses waiting in the Eagle Ravine. How much money have you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Two thousand dollars in gold, and five in notes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That will do. I have as much more to add to it. We must push for Carson City through the mountains.
<p/>While Ferrier was absent, preparing his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) daughter for the approaching journey, Jefferson Hope packed all the eatables that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) could find into a small parcel, and filled a stoneware jar with water, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) knew by experience that the mountain wells were few and far between.
<p/>You had best wake Lucy. It is as well that the servants do not sleep in the house. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) had hardly completed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) arrangements before the farmer returned with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) daughter all dressed and ready for a start.
<p/>The greeting between the lovers was warm, but brief, for minutes were precious, and there was much to be done. ''
<p/>We must make our start at once,'' said Jefferson Hope, speaking in a low but resolute voice, like one who realizes the greatness of the peril, but has steeled his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) heart to meet it.
<p/>The front and back entrances are watched, but with caution we may get away through the side window and across the fields.
<p/>'' Once on the road we are only two miles from the Ravine where the horses are waiting. By daybreak we should be half-way through the mountains.
<p/>'' '' What if we are stopped,'' asked Ferrier. Hope slapped the revolver butt which protruded from the front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) tunic.
<p/>If they are too many for us we shall take two or three of them with us,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) said with a sinister smile.
<p/>The lights inside the house had all been extinguished, and from the darkened window Ferrier peered over the fields which had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) own, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was now about to abandon for ever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) had long nerved himself to the sacrifice, however, and the thought of the honour and happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) daughter outweighed any regret at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) ruined fortunes.
<p/>All looked so peaceful and happy, the rustling trees and the broad silent stretch of grain-land, that it was difficult to realize that the spirit of murder lurked through it all.
<p/>Yet the white face and set expression of the young hunter showed that in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) approach to the house he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had seen enough to satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) upon that head.
<p/>Ferrier carried the bag of gold and notes, Jefferson Hope had the scanty provisions and water, while Lucy had a small bundle containing a few of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) more valued possessions.
<p/>Opening the window very slowly and carefully, they waited until a dark cloud had somewhat obscured the night, and then one by one passed through into the little garden.
<p/>With bated breath and crouching figures they stumbled across it, and gained the shelter of the hedge, which they skirted until they came to the gap which opened into the cornfields.
<p/>They had just reached this point when the young man seized his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two companions and dragged them down into the shadow, where they lay silent and trembling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends had hardly crouched down before the melancholy hooting of a mountain owl was heard within a few yards of them, which was immediately answered by another hoot at a small distance.
<p/>At the same moment a vague shadowy figure emerged from the gap for which they had been making, and uttered the plaintive signal cry again, on which a second man appeared out of the obscurity.
<p/>'' It was as well that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prairie training had given Jefferson Hope the ears of a lynx. '' To-morrow at midnight,'' said the first who appeared to be in authority.
<p/>'' When the Whip-poor-Will calls three times.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is well,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other. '' Shall I tell Brother Drebber?'' <div class="bookquote">``Pass it on to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>), and from him (<font color='blue'><b>Brother</b></font>) to the others.
<p/>Nine to seven!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Seven to five! '' repeated the other, and the two figures flitted away in different directions. Their concluding words had evidently been some form of sign and countersign.
<p/>The instant that their footsteps had died away in the distance, Jefferson Hope sprang to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) feet, and helping his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) companions through the gap, led the way across the fields at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) speed, supporting and half-carrying the girl when her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) strength appeared to fail her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hurry on! hurry on! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) gasped from time to time. '' We are through the line of sentinels. Everything depends on speed.
<p/>Hurry on!'' Once on the high road they made rapid progress. Only once did they meet anyone, and then they managed to slip into a field, and so avoid recognition.
<p/>Two dark jagged peaks loomed above them through the darkness, and the defile which led between them was the Eagle Cañon in which the horses were awaiting them.
<p/>With unerring instinct Jefferson Hope picked his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) way among the great boulders and along the bed of a dried-up watercourse, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) came to the retired corner, screened with rocks, where the faithful animals had been picketed.
<p/>The girl was placed upon the mule, and old Ferrier upon one of the horses, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) money-bag, while Jefferson Hope led the other along the precipitous and dangerous path.
<p/>Before reaching the town the hunter branched away into a rugged and narrow footpath which led to the mountains. It was a bewildering route for anyone who was not accustomed to face Nature in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wildest moods.
<p/>On the one side a great crag towered up a thousand feet or more, black, stern, and menacing, with long basaltic columns upon its rugged surface like the ribs of some petrified monster.
<p/>Between the two ran the irregular track, so narrow in places that they had to travel in Indian file, and so rough that only practised riders could have traversed it at all.
<p/>Yet in spite of all dangers and difficulties, the hearts of the fugitives were light within them, for every step increased the distance between them and the terrible despotism from which they were flying.
<p/>On the other hand a wild chaos of boulders and debris made all advance impossible. They soon had a proof, however, that they were still within the jurisdiction of the Saints.
<p/>They had reached the very wildest and most desolate portion of the pass when the girl gave a startled cry, and pointed upwards.
<p/>On a rock which overlooked the track, showing out dark and plain against the sky, there stood a solitary sentinel. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) saw them as soon as they perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) military challenge of <div class="bookquote">``Who goes there?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>rang through the silent ravine. '' Travellers for Nevada,'' said Jefferson Hope, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) hand upon the rifle which hung by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) saddle.
<p/>They could see the lonely watcher fingering his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) gun, and peering down at them as if dissatisfied at their reply. ''
<p/>By whose permission?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) asked. '' The Holy Four,'' answered Ferrier. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) Mormon experiences had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) that that was the highest authority to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) could refer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine from seven,''  (<font color='red'><b>the sentinel</b></font>)</div>cried the sentinel. '' Seven from five,'' returned Jefferson Hope promptly, remembering the countersign which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jefferson</b></font>) had heard in the garden.
<p/>'' Pass, and the Lord go with you,'' said the voice from above. Beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) post the path broadened out, and the horses were able to break into a trot.
<p/>Looking back, they could see the solitary watcher leaning upon his (<font color='blue'><b>watcher</b></font>) gun, and knew that they had passed the outlying post of the chosen people, and that freedom lay before them.
<p/>More than once they lost their way, but Hope's intimate knowledge of the mountains enabled them to regain the track once more.
<p/>CHAPTER V. THE AVENGING ANGELS. ALL night their course lay through intricate defiles and over irregular and rock-strewn paths. When morning broke, a scene of marvellous though savage beauty lay before them.
<p/>So steep were the rocky banks on either side of them, that the larch and the pine seemed to be suspended over their heads, and to need only a gust of wind to come hurtling down upon them.
<p/>Nor was the fear entirely an illusion, for the barren valley was thickly strewn with trees and boulders which had fallen in a similar manner.
<p/>Even as they passed, a great rock came thundering down with a hoarse rattle which woke the echoes in the silent gorges, and startled the weary horses into a gallop.
<p/>As the sun rose slowly above the eastern horizon, the caps of the great mountains lit up one after the other, like lamps at a festival, until they were all ruddy and glowing.
<p/>In every direction the great snow-capped peaks hemmed them in, peeping over each other's shoulders to the far horizon. The magnificent spectacle cheered the hearts of the three fugitives and gave them fresh energy.
<p/>At a wild torrent which swept out of a ravine they called a halt and watered their horses, while they partook of a hasty breakfast.
<p/>Lucy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) father would fain have rested longer, but Jefferson Hope was inexorable. '' They will be upon our track by this time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) said.
<p/>During the whole of that day they struggled on through the defiles, and by evening they calculated that they were more than thirty miles from their enemies.
<p/>At night-time they chose the base of a beetling crag, where the rocks offered some protection from the chill wind, and there huddled together for warmth, they enjoyed a few hours' sleep.
<p/>'' Everything depends upon our speed. Once safe in Carson we may rest for the remainder of our lives. '' Before daybreak, however, they were up and on their way once more.
<p/>They had seen no signs of any pursuers, and Jefferson Hope began to think that they were fairly out of the reach of the terrible organization whose enmity they had incurred.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) little knew how far that iron grasp could reach, or how soon it was to close upon them and crush them.
<p/>This gave the hunter little uneasiness, however, for there was game to be had among the mountains, and he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had frequently before had to depend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) rifle for the needs of life.
<p/>Choosing a sheltered nook, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) piled together a few dried branches and made a blazing fire, at which his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) companions might warm themselves, for they were now nearly five thousand feet above the sea level, and the air was bitter and keen.
<p/>Having tethered the horses, and bade Lucy adieu, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) gun over his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) shoulder, and set out in search of whatever chance might throw in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) way.
<p/>Looking back he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) saw the old man and the young girl crouching over the blazing fire, while the three animals stood motionless in the back-ground.
<p/>About the middle of the second day of their flight their scanty store of provisions began to run out. Then the intervening rocks hid them from his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) view.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) walked for a couple of miles through one ravine after another without success, though from the marks upon the bark of the trees, and other indications, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) judged that there were numerous bears in the vicinity.
<p/>At last, after two or three hours' fruitless search, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was thinking of turning back in despair, when casting his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) eyes upwards he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) saw a sight which sent a thrill of pleasure through his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) heart.
<p/>On the edge of a jutting pinnacle, three or four hundred feet above him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>), there stood a creature somewhat resembling a sheep in appearance, but armed with a pair of gigantic horns.
<p/>The big-horn--for so it is called--was acting, probably, as a guardian over a flock which were invisible to the hunter; but fortunately it was heading in the opposite direction, and had not perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>).
<p/>Lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) rifle upon a rock, and took a long and steady aim before drawing the trigger.
<p/>The animal sprang into the air, tottered for a moment upon the edge of the precipice, and then came crashing down into the valley beneath.
<p/>The creature was too unwieldy to lift, so the hunter contented himself with cutting away one haunch and part of the flank.
<p/>With this trophy over his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) shoulder, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hastened to retrace his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) steps, for the evening was already drawing in. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had hardly started, however, before he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) realized the difficulty which faced him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>).
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) eagerness he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had wandered far past the ravines which were known to him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>), and it was no easy matter to pick out the path which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had taken.
<p/>The valley in which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) found himself divided and sub-divided into many gorges, which were so like each other that it was impossible to distinguish one from the other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) followed one for a mile or more until he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) came to a mountain torrent which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had never seen before.
<p/>Night was coming on rapidly, and it was almost dark before he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) at last found himself in a defile which was familiar to him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>).
<p/>Even then it was no easy matter to keep to the right track, for the moon had not yet risen, and the high cliffs on either side made the obscurity more profound.
<p/>Weighed down with his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) burden, and weary from his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) exertions, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) stumbled along, keeping up his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) heart by the reflection that every step brought him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) nearer to Lucy, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) carried with him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) enough to ensure them food for the remainder of their journey.
<p/>Convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had taken the wrong turn, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) tried another, but with the same result. He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had now come to the mouth of the very defile in which he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had left them.
<p/>Even in the darkness he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) could recognize the outline of the cliffs which bounded it. They must, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) reflected, be awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) anxiously, for he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had been absent nearly five hours.
<p/>In the gladness of his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hands to his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) mouth and made the glen re-echo to a loud halloo as a signal that he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) was coming.
<p/>None came save his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) own cry, which clattered up the dreary silent ravines, and was borne back to his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) ears in countless repetitions.
<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) shouted, even louder than before, and again no whisper came back from the friends whom he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) had left such a short time ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) paused and listened for an answer. A vague, nameless dread came over him (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hurried onwards frantically, dropping the precious food in his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) agitation.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) turned the corner, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) came full in sight of the spot where the fire had been lit. There was still a glowing pile of wood ashes there, but it had evidently not been tended since his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) departure.
<p/>The same dead silence still reigned all round. With his (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) fears all changed to convictions, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) hurried on. There was no living creature near the remains of the fire: animals, man, maiden, all were gone.
<p/>It was only too clear that some sudden and terrible disaster had occurred during his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) absence--a disaster which had embraced them all, and yet had left no traces behind it.
<p/>Bewildered and stunned by this blow, Jefferson Hope felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) head spin round, and had to lean upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) rifle to save himself from falling.
<p/>Seizing a half-consumed piece of wood from the smouldering fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) blew it into a flame, and proceeded with its help to examine the little camp.
<p/>The ground was all stamped down by the feet of horses, showing that a large party of mounted men had overtaken the fugitives, and the direction of their tracks proved that they had afterwards turned back to Salt Lake City.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) was essentially a man of action, however, and speedily recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) temporary impotence. Had they carried back both of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) companions with them?
<p/>Jefferson Hope had almost persuaded himself that they must have done so, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) eye fell upon an object which made every nerve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) body tingle within him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>).
<p/>A little way on one side of the camp was a low-lying heap of reddish soil, which had assuredly not been there before.
<p/>As the young hunter approached it, he (<font color='blue'><b>hunter</b></font>) perceived that a stick had been planted on it, with a sheet of paper stuck in the cleft fork of it.
<p/>The inscription upon the paper was brief, but to the point: JOHN FERRIER, FORMERLY OF SALT LAKE CITY, -LSB-22-RSB- Died August 4th, 1860.
<p/>The sturdy old man, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left so short a time before, was gone, then, and this was all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) epitaph.
<p/>There was no mistaking it for anything but a newly-dug grave. Jefferson Hope looked wildly round to see if there was a second grave, but there was no sign of one.
<p/>Lucy had been carried back by their terrible pursuers to fulfil her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) original destiny, by becoming one of the harem of the Elder's son.
<p/>As the young fellow realized the certainty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fate, and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own powerlessness to prevent it, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wished that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), too, was lying with the old farmer in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) last silent resting-place.
<p/>Again, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) active spirit shook off the lethargy which springs from despair. If there was nothing else left to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could at least devote his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) life to revenge.
<p/>With indomitable patience and perseverance, Jefferson Hope possessed also a power of sustained vindictiveness, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) may have learned from the Indians amongst whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) had lived.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) stood by the desolate fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) felt that the only one thing which could assuage his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) grief would be thorough and complete retribution, brought by his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) own hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) enemies.
<p/>With a grim, white face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) retraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) steps to where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) had dropped the food, and having stirred up the smouldering fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) cooked enough to last him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) for a few days.
<p/>This he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) made up into a bundle, and, tired as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) set himself to walk back through the mountains upon the track of the avenging angels.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) strong will and untiring energy should, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) determined, be devoted to that one end. For five days he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) toiled footsore and weary through the defiles which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) had already traversed on horseback.
<p/>At night he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) flung himself down among the rocks, and snatched a few hours of sleep; but before daybreak he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) was always well on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) way.
<p/>On the sixth day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) reached the Eagle Cañon, from which they had commenced their ill-fated flight. Thence he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) could look down upon the home of the saints.
<p/>Worn and exhausted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) leaned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) rifle and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) gaunt hand fiercely at the silent widespread city beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) looked at it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) observed that there were flags in some of the principal streets, and other signs of festivity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) was still speculating as to what this might mean when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) heard the clatter of horse's hoofs, and saw a mounted man riding towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) therefore accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with the object of finding out what Lucy Ferrier's fate had been.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approached, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a Mormon named Cowper, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) had rendered services at different times. ''
<p/>The Mormon looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) with undisguised astonishment--indeed, it was difficult to recognize in this tattered, unkempt wanderer, with ghastly white face and fierce, wild eyes, the spruce young hunter of former days.
<p/>I am Jefferson Hope,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) said. '' You remember me. '' Having, however, at last, satisfied himself as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) identity, the man's surprise changed to consternation.
<p/>'' You are mad to come here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) cried. '' It is as much as my own life is worth to be seen talking with you.
<p/>There is a warrant against you from the Holy Four for assisting the Ferriers away. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't fear them, or their warrant,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jefferson Hope/Hope/Jefferson</b></font>)</div>Hope said, earnestly.
<p/>'' You must know something of this matter, Cowper. I conjure you by everything you hold dear to answer a few questions.
<p/>We have always been friends. For God's sake, don't refuse to answer me. '' '' What is it? '' the Mormon asked uneasily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Be quick. The very rocks have ears and the trees eyes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What has become of Lucy Ferrier?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was married yesterday to young Drebber.
<p/>Hold up, man, hold up, you have no life left in you. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Hope faintly. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was white to the very lips, and had sunk down on the stone against which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been leaning.
<p/>'' Married, you say?'' '' Married yesterday--that's what those flags are for on the Endowment House. There was some words between young Drebber and young Stangerson as to which was to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>).
<p/>They'd both been in the party that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) father, which seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) the best claim; but
<p/>when they argued it out in council, Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Prophet</b></font>). No one won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) very long though, for I saw death in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) face yesterday.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off, then?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I am off,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jefferson Hope/Hope/Jefferson</b></font>)</div>said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) seat.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) answered; and, slinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) weapon over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts.
<p/>'' Where are you going?'' Amongst them all there was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself. The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled.
<p/>Whether it was the terrible death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) father or the effects of the hateful marriage into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mormon</b></font>) had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) head again, but pined away and died within a month.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sottish husband, who had married her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) principally for the sake of John Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) bereavement; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) other wives mourned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and sat up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom.
<p/>They were grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open, and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode into the room.
<p/>Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the pure soul of Lucy Ferrier.
<p/>Stooping over her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips reverently to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) cold forehead, and then, snatching up her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the wedding-ring from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) finger.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) shall not be buried in that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be raised sprang down the stairs and was gone.
<p/>So strange and so brief was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) as having been a bride had disappeared.
<p/>For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading a strange wild life, and nursing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) heart the fierce desire for vengeance which possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>).
<p/>Tales were told in the City of the weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which haunted the lonely mountain gorges.
<p/>On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great boulder crashed down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) only escaped a terrible death by throwing himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) face.
<p/>The two young Mormons were not long in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or killing their enemy, but always without success.
<p/>'' Once a bullet whistled through Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>). Then they adopted the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of having their houses guarded.
<p/>After a time they were able to relax these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) vindictiveness.
<p/>The hunter's mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no room for any other emotion.
<p/>Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) was, however, above all things practical. He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) soon realized that even his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) iron constitution could not stand the incessant strain which he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) was putting upon it.
<p/>Exposure and want of wholesome food were wearing him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) out. If he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) died like a dog among the mountains, what was to become of his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) revenge then?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) felt that that was to play his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) enemy's game, so he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) reluctantly returned to the old Nevada mines, there to recruit his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) health and to amass money enough to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) to pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) object without privation.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) leaving the mines for nearly five.
<p/>At the end of that time, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) wrongs and his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) craving for revenge were quite as keen as on that memorable night when he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) had stood by John Ferrier's grave.
<p/>Disguised, and under an assumed name, he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) returned to Salt Lake City, careless what became of his (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) own life, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) obtained what he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) knew to be justice.
<p/>There had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become Gentiles.
<p/>And yet such a death was sure to overtake him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) persisted. There he (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>) found evil tidings awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>opponent</b></font>). Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one knew whither they had gone.
<p/>Rumour reported that Drebber had managed to convert a large part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) property into money, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) had departed a wealthy man, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) companion, Stangerson, was comparatively poor.
<p/>Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never faltered for a moment.
<p/>With the small competence he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) possessed, eked out by such employment as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) could pick up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) travelled from town to town through the United States in quest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) enemies.
<p/>Year passed into year, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) black hair turned grizzled, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) wandered on, a human bloodhound, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) mind wholly set upon the one object upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) had devoted his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) life.
<p/>It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) was in pursuit of.
<p/>There was no clue at all, however, as to their whereabouts. At last his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) perseverance was rewarded. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) miserable lodgings with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) plan of vengeance all arranged.
<p/>It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder in his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by Stangerson, who had become his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) private secretary, and represented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and hatred of an old rival.
<p/>When at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) was liberated, it was only to find that Drebber's house was deserted, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) secretary had departed for Europe.
<p/>That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some weeks. Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) concentrated hatred urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) to continue the pursuit.
<p/>Funds were wanting, however, and for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) had to return to work, saving every dollar for his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) approaching journey.
<p/>At last, having collected enough to keep life in him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) departed for Europe, and tracked his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) enemies from city to city, working his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking the fugitives.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) reached St. Petersburg they had departed for Paris; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) followed them there he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) learned that they had just set off for Copenhagen.
<p/>At the Danish capital he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) was again a few days late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) at last succeeded in running them to earth.
<p/>As to what occurred there, we cannot do better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in Dr. Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.
<p/>A CONTINUATION OF THE REMINISCENCES OF JOHN WATSON, M.D.. OUR prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any ferocity in his (<font color='blue'><b>WATSON</b></font>) disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself powerless, he (<font color='blue'><b>WATSON</b></font>) smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>WATSON</b></font>) hopes that he (<font color='blue'><b>WATSON</b></font>) had not hurt any of us in the scuffle.
<p/>CHAPTER VI. '' I guess you're going to take me to the police-station,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>WATSON</b></font>) remarked to Sherlock Holmes. '' My cab's at the door.
<p/>If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it. I'm not so light to lift as I used to be.
<p/>Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner at his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) ancles.
<p/>I remember that I thought to myself, as I eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>), that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and energy which was as formidable as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) personal strength.
<p/>If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you are the man for it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, gazing with undisguised admiration at my fellow-lodger.
<p/>'' -LSB-23-RSB- He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs, as though to assure himself that they were free once more. '' ''
<p/>The way you kept on my trail was a caution. '' <div class="bookquote">``You had better come with me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes to the two detectives.
<p/>'' I can drive you,'' said Lestrade. '' Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us.
<p/>Our prisoner made no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>), and we followed him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>'' I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination.
<p/>We were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he (<font color='blue'><b>Inspector</b></font>) had been charged.
<p/>The prisoner will be put before the magistrates in the course of the week,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you wish to say?
<p/>The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who went through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duties in a dull mechanical way. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and may be used against you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I've got a good deal to say,''  (<font color='red'><b>prisoner</b></font>)</div>our prisoner said slowly. '' I want to tell you gentlemen all about it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the Inspector</b></font>)</div>asked the Inspector. '' I may never be tried,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Inspector</b></font>) answered. ''
<p/>You needn't look startled. It isn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) fierce dark eyes upon me as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) asked this last question.
<p/>'' Yes; I am,'' I answered. '' Then put your hand here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, with a smile, motioning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) manacled wrists towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) chest.
<p/>The walls of his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) chest seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when some powerful engine was at work.
<p/>In the silence of the room I could hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same source.
<p/>I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing and commotion which was going on inside. '' Why,'' I cried, <div class="bookquote">``you have an aortic aneurism!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I went to a Doctor last week about it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) told me that it is bound to burst before many days passed.
<p/>'' That's what they call it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, placidly. '' It has been getting worse for years. I got it from over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains.
<p/>I've done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like to leave some account of the business behind me.
<p/>The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to the advisability of allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Inspector</b></font>) to tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Inspector</b></font>) story.
<p/>I don't want to be remembered as a common cut-throat. '' '' Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?
<p/>'' the former asked, -LSB-24-RSB- '' Most certainly there is,'' I answered. '' In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) statement,'' said the Inspector.
<p/>'' You are at liberty, sir, to give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll sit down, with your leave,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>the prisoner said, suiting the action to the word.
<p/>This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters.
<p/>Every word I say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no consequence to me.
<p/>'' I'm on the brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. '' With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) chair and began the following remarkable statement.
<p/>I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.
<p/>It don't much matter to you why I hated these men,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it's enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their own lives.
<p/>After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime, it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any court.
<p/>I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) spoke in a calm and methodical manner, as though the events which he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) narrated were commonplace enough. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You'd have done the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my place.
<p/>'' That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart over it.
<p/>I took the marriage ring from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dead finger, and I vowed that his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) last thoughts should be of the crime for which he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) was punished.
<p/>I have carried it about with me, and have followed him (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) accomplice over two continents until I caught them.
<p/>If I die to-morrow, as is likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and well done.
<p/>They thought to tire me out, but they could not do it. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left for me to hope for, or to desire.
<p/>When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I found that I must turn my hand to something for my living.
<p/>Driving and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a cabowner's office, and soon got employment.
<p/>I was to bring a certain sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for myself.
<p/>'' They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me to follow them. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along somehow.
<p/>The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most confusing.
<p/>I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.
<p/>It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across them.
<p/>'' They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other side of the river. When once I found them out
<p/>I knew that I had them at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their recognizing me.
<p/>I would dog them and follow them until I saw my opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.
<p/>'' They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about London, I was always at their heels.
<p/>Sometimes I followed them on my cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then they could not get away from me.
<p/>It was only early in the morning or late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get behind hand with my employer.
<p/>I did not mind that, however, as long as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted. '' They were very cunning, though.
<p/>They must have thought that there was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out alone, and never after nightfall.
<p/>During two weeks I drove behind them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping.
<p/>I watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost come.
<p/>My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a little too soon and leave my work undone.
<p/>At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive up to their door.
<p/>I whipped up my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for I feared that they were going to shift their quarters.
<p/>At Euston Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed them on to the platform.
<p/>I heard them ask for the Liverpool train, and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be another for some hours.
<p/>'' Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise.
<p/>Drebber said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) had a little business of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) own to do, and that if the other would wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) would soon rejoin him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>).
<p/>I got so close to them in the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) companion remonstrated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>), and reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) that they had resolved to stick together.
<p/>I could not catch what Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) was nothing more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) paid servant, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>) must not presume to dictate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stangerson</b></font>).
<p/>On that the Secretary gave it up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) missed the last train he (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) should rejoin him (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which Drebber answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) would be back on the platform before eleven, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) way out of the station.
<p/>Drebber answered that the matter was a delicate one, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) must go alone. '' The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come.
<p/>I had my enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue precipitation.
<p/>There is no satisfaction in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that strikes him (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>), and why retribution has come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>offender</b></font>).
<p/>I had my plans arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who had wronged me understand that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old sin had found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out.
<p/>It chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of one of them in my carriage.
<p/>It was claimed that same evening, and returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a duplicate constructed.
<p/>By means of this I had access to at least one spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from interruption.
<p/>My plans were already formed. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult problem which I had now to solve.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops, staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them.
<p/>'' When he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) came out he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) staggered in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was a hansom just in front of me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hailed it.
<p/>I followed it so close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) driver the whole way.
<p/>We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the Terrace in which he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had boarded.
<p/>I could not imagine what his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab a hundred yards or so from the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) entered it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) hansom drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets dry with the talking.
<p/>Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour, or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling inside the house.
<p/>Next moment the door was flung open and two men appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap whom I had never seen before.
<p/>This fellow had Drebber by the collar, and when they came to the head of the steps he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) a shove and a kick which sent him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) half across the road. '
<p/>'' I handed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) the glass, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) drank it down. '' That's better,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said. '' You hound,' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cried, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) stick at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); `I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was so hot that I think he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would have thrashed Drebber with his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) legs would carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing my cab, he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) hailed me and jumped in. ' Drive me to Halliday's Private Hotel,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>).
<p/>When I had him (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong.
<p/>I might take him (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) right out into the country, and there in some deserted lane have my last interview with him (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>).
<p/>'' I drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I had almost decided upon this, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) solved the problem for me.
<p/>The craze for drink had seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) went in, leaving word that I should wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>).
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) remained until closing time, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) came out he (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) was so far gone that I knew the game was in my own hands.
<p/>It would only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring myself to do it.
<p/>I had long determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) should have a show for his (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) life if he (<font color='blue'><b>Halliday</b></font>) chose to take advantage of it.
<p/>Among the many billets which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College.
<p/>One day the professor was lecturing on poisions, -LSB-25-RSB- and he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) showed his (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) students some alkaloid, as he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) called it, which he (<font color='blue'><b>professor</b></font>) had extracted from some South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least grain meant instant death.
<p/>I spotted the bottle in which this preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to a little of it.
<p/>I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with a similar pill made without the poison.
<p/>I determined at the time that when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained.
<p/>'' Don't imagine that I intended to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in cold blood. It would be quite as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a handkerchief.
<p/>From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me, and the time had now come when I was to use them.
<p/>'' It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside
<p/>If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your reach, you would understand my feelings.
<p/>I lit a cigar, and puffed at it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples throbbing with excitement.
<p/>As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me, just as plain as I see you all in this room.
<p/>All the way they were ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the house in the Brixton Road.
<p/>, I was glad within--so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation. '' There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the dripping of the rain.
<p/>When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) by the arm, `It's time to get out,' I said.
<p/>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) thought we had come to the hotel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) had mentioned, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.
<p/>'' `All right, cabby,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>cabby</b></font>). '' I had to walk beside him (<font color='blue'><b>cabby</b></font>) to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>cabby</b></font>) steady, for he (<font color='blue'><b>cabby</b></font>) was still a little top-heavy.
<p/>When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>cabby</b></font>) into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father and the daughter were walking in front of us.
<p/>''`We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it to a wax candle which I had brought with me. '
<p/>''`It's infernally dark,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), stamping about. Now, Enoch Drebber,' I continued, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>), and holding the light to my own face, `who am I?'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) whole features, which showed me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) knew me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) staggered back with a livid face, and I saw the perspiration break out upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) brow, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) teeth chattered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) head.
<p/>I had always known that vengeance would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul which now possessed me.
<p/>'' At the sight, I leaned my back against the door and laughed loud and long. ''`You dog!' I said; 'I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St. Petersburg, and you have always escaped me.
<p/>Now, at last your wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see to-morrow's sun rise.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I could see on his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) thought I was mad.
<p/>The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me.
<p/>So I was for the time. '' `What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cried, locking the door, and shaking the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) face. '
<p/>Punishment has been slow in coming, but it has overtaken you at last.' I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) coward lips tremble as I spoke.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) would have begged for his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) life, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) knew well that it was useless. '' `Would you murder me?' he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) stammered.
<p/>What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) slaughtered father, and bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) away to your accursed and shameless harem.'
<p/>'' `There is no murder,' I answered. ' Who talks of murdering a mad dog? '' `It was not I who killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) father,' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' ' But it was you who broke her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) innocent heart,' I shrieked, thrusting the box before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). ' Let the high God judge between us.
<p/>Choose and eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we are ruled by chance.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my knife and held it to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) throat until he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had obeyed me.
<p/>Then I swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to die.
<p/>Shall I ever forget the look which came over his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face when the first warning pangs told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that the poison was in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) system?
<p/>'' I laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is rapid.
<p/>A spasm of pain contorted his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) features; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands out in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily upon the floor.
<p/>I turned him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) over with my foot, and placed my hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart. There was no movement. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was dead! ''
<p/>The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice of it. I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write upon the wall with it.
<p/>I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE written up above him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and it was argued at the time in the newspapers that the secret societies must have done it.
<p/>I guessed that what puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the wall.
<p/>Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody about, and that the night was still very wild.
<p/>I had driven some distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept Lucy's ring, and found that it was not there.
<p/>Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and cheerful. I was thunderstruck at this, for it was the only memento that I had of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).
<p/>Thinking that I might have dropped it when I stooped over Drebber's body, I drove back, and leaving my cab in a side street, I went boldly up to the house--for I was ready to dare anything rather than lose the ring.
<p/>When I arrived there, I walked right into the arms of a police-officer who was coming out, and only managed to disarm his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) suspicions by pretending to be hopelessly drunk.
<p/>'' That was how Enoch Drebber came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) end. All I had to do then was to do as much for Stangerson, and so pay off John Ferrier's debt.
<p/>I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) was staying at Halliday's Private Hotel, and I hung about all day, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) never came out.
<p/>-LSB-26-RSB- fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrier</b></font>) suspected something when Drebber failed to put in an appearance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) was cunning, was Stangerson, and always on his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) guard.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) could keep me off by staying indoors he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) was very much mistaken. I soon found out which was the window of his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) bedroom, and
<p/>early next morning I took advantage of some ladders which were lying in the lane behind the hotel, and so made my way into his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) room in the grey of the dawn.
<p/>I woke him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) up and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) that the hour had come when he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) was to answer for the life he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) had taken so long before.
<p/>Instead of grasping at the chance of safety which that offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) sprang from his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) bed and flew at my throat.
<p/>I described Drebber's death to him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>), and I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) the same choice of the poisoned pills. In self-defence I stabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) to the heart.
<p/>It would have been the same in any case, for Providence would never have allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Drebber</b></font>) guilty hand to pick out anything but the poison.
<p/>I went on cabbing it for a day or so, intending to keep at it until I could save enough to take me back to America.
<p/>I was standing in the yard when a ragged youngster asked if there was a cabby there called Jefferson Hope, and said that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) cab was wanted by a gentleman at 221B, Baker Street.
<p/>I went round, suspecting no harm, and the next thing I knew, this young man here had the bracelets on my wrists, and as neatly snackled -LSB-27-RSB- as ever I saw in my life.
<p/>'' I have little more to say, and it's as well, for I am about done up. That's the whole of my story, gentlemen.
<p/>You may consider me to be a murderer; but I hold that I am just as much an officer of justice as you are.
<p/>'' So thrilling had the man's narrative been, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner was so impressive that we had sat silent and absorbed.
<p/>Even the professional detectives, blasé as they were in every detail of crime, appeared to be keenly interested in the man's story.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finished we sat for some minutes in a stillness which was only broken by the scratching of Lestrade's pencil as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) gave the finishing touches to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lestrade</b></font>) shorthand account.
<p/>'' There is only one point on which I should like a little more information,'' Sherlock Holmes said at last. ''
<p/>Who was your accomplice who came for the ring which I advertised? '' The prisoner winked at my friend jocosely. ''
<p/>I saw your advertisement, and I thought it might be a plant, or it might be the ring which I wanted.
<p/>I can tell my own secrets,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't get other people into trouble. My friend volunteered to go and see.
<p/>I think you'll own he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did it smartly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a doubt of that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Holmes/Sherlock Holmes/Mr. Sherlock Holmes</b></font>)</div>said Holmes heartily. '' Now, gentlemen,'' the Inspector remarked gravely, <div class="bookquote">``the forms of the law must be complied with.
<p/>On Thursday the prisoner will be brought before the magistrates, and your attendance will be required. Until then I will be responsible for him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) rang the bell as he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) spoke, and Jefferson Hope was led off by a couple of warders, while my friend and I made our way out of the Station and took a cab back to Baker Street.
<p/>WE had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the Thursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our testimony.
<p/>A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would be meted out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>).
<p/>On the very night after his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) capture the aneurism burst, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of the cell, with a placid smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) face, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) had been able in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hope</b></font>) dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on work well done.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the Inspector</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VII. THE CONCLUSION. '' Gregson and Lestrade will be wild about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) death,'' Holmes remarked, as we chatted it over next evening.
<p/>'' Where will their grand advertisement be now?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't see that they had very much to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Holmes</b></font>) capture,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.
<p/>'' What you do in this world is a matter of no consequence,'' returned my companion, bitterly. '' The question is, what can you make people believe that you have done.
<p/>Never mind,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) continued, more brightly, after a pause. '' I would not have missed the investigation for anything. There has been no better case within my recollection.
<p/>Simple as it was, there were several most instructive points about it.'' <div class="bookquote">``Simple! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ejaculated. '' Well, really, it can hardly be described as otherwise,'' said Sherlock Holmes, smiling at my surprise.
<p/>The proof of its intrinsic simplicity is, that without any help save a few very ordinary deductions I was able to lay my hand upon the criminal within three days.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have already explained to you that what is out of the common is usually a guide rather than a hindrance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is true,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I. In solving a problem of this sort, the grand thing is to be able to reason backwards.
<p/>In the every-day affairs of life it is more useful to reason forwards, and so the other comes to be neglected.
<p/>That is a very useful accomplishment, and a very easy one, but people do not practise it much. There are fifty who can reason synthetically for one who can reason analytically.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I confess,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``that I do not quite follow you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hardly expected that you would. Let me see if I can make it clearer.
<p/>Most people, if you describe a train of events to them, will tell you what the result would be. They can put those events together in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass.
<p/>There are few people, however, who, if you told them a result, would be able to evolve from their own inner consciousness what the steps were which led up to that result.
<p/>This power is what I mean when I talk of reasoning backwards, or analytically.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I. <div class="bookquote">``Now this was a case in which you were given the result and had to find everything else for yourself.
<p/>Now let me endeavour to show you the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I approached the house, as you know, on foot, and with my mind entirely free from all impressions.
<p/>I naturally began by examining the roadway, and there, as I have already explained to you, I saw clearly the marks of a cab, which, I ascertained by inquiry, must have been there during the night.
<p/>I satisfied myself that it was a cab and not a private carriage by the narrow gauge of the wheels. The ordinary London growler is considerably less wide than a gentleman's brougham.
<p/>I then walked slowly down the garden path, which happened to be composed of a clay soil, peculiarly suitable for taking impressions.
<p/>No doubt it appeared to you to be a mere trampled line of slush, but to my trained eyes every mark upon its surface had a meaning.
<p/>There is no branch of detective science which is so important and so much neglected as the art of tracing footsteps.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>This was the first point gained. Happily, I have always laid great stress upon it, and much practice has made it second nature to me.
<p/>I saw the heavy footmarks of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had first passed through the garden.
<p/>It was easy to tell that they had been before the others, because in places their marks had been entirely obliterated by the others coming upon the top of them.
<p/>In this way my second link was formed, which told me that the nocturnal visitors were two in number, one remarkable for his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) height -LRB-as I calculated from the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) stride-RRB-, and the other fashionably dressed, to judge from the small and elegant impression left by his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) boots. ''
<p/>On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was.
<p/>There was no wound upon the dead man's person, but the agitated expression upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face assured me that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had foreseen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fate before it came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Having sniffed the dead man's lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had poison forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Men who die from heart disease, or any sudden natural cause, never by any chance exhibit agitation upon their features. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the hatred and fear expressed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts. Do not imagine that it was a very unheard of idea.
<p/>The forcible administration of poison is by no means a new thing in criminal annals. The cases of Dolsky in Odessa, and of Leturier in Montpellier, will occur at once to any toxicologist.
<p/>'' And now came the great question as to the reason why. Robbery had not been the object of the murder, for nothing was taken.
<p/>Was it politics, then, or was it a woman? That was the question which confronted me. I was inclined from the first to the latter supposition.
<p/>This murder had, on the contrary, been done most deliberately, and the perpetrator had left his (<font color='blue'><b>perpetrator</b></font>) tracks all over the room, showing that he (<font color='blue'><b>perpetrator</b></font>) had been there all the time.
<p/>Political assassins are only too glad to do their work and to fly. It must have been a private wrong, and not a political one, which called for such a methodical revenge.
<p/>When the inscription was discovered upon the wall I was more inclined than ever to my opinion. The thing was too evidently a blind.
<p/>When the ring was found, however, it settled the question. Clearly the murderer had used it to remind his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) victim of some dead or absent woman.
<p/>It was at this point that I asked Gregson whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) had enquired in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gregson</b></font>) telegram to Cleveland as to any particular point in Mr. Drebber's former career.
<p/>I then proceeded to make a careful examination of the room, which confirmed me in my opinion as to the murderer's height, and furnished me with the additional details as to the Trichinopoly cigar and the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) nails.
<p/>I had already come to the conclusion, since there were no signs of a struggle, that the blood which covered the floor had burst from the murderer's nose in his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) excitement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) answered, you remember, in the negative. '' I could perceive that the track of blood coincided with the track of his (<font color='blue'><b>murderer</b></font>) feet.
<p/>It is seldom that any man, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very full-blooded, breaks out in this way through emotion, so I hazarded the opinion that the criminal was probably a robust and ruddy-faced man.
<p/>I telegraphed to the head of the police at Cleveland, limiting my enquiry to the circumstances connected with the marriage of Enoch Drebber.
<p/>Events proved that I had judged correctly. '' Having left the house, I proceeded to do what Gregson had neglected. The answer was conclusive.
<p/>It told me that Drebber had already applied for the protection of the law against an old rival in love, named Jefferson Hope, and that this same Hope was at present in Europe.
<p/>I knew now that I held the clue to the mystery in my hand, and all that remained was to secure the murderer.
<p/>I had already determined in my own mind that the man who had walked into the house with Drebber, was none other than the man who had driven the cab.
<p/>The marks in the road showed me that the horse had wandered on in a way which would have been impossible
<p/>'' had there been anyone in charge of it. Where, then, could the driver be, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) were inside the house?
<p/>Again, it is absurd to suppose that any sane man would carry out a deliberate crime under the very eyes, as it were, of a third person, who was sure to betray him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>All these considerations led me to the irresistible conclusion that Jefferson Hope was to be found among the jarveys of the Metropolis.
<p/>Lastly, supposing one man wished to dog another through London, what better means could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adopt than to turn cabdriver. ''
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been one there was no reason to believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ceased to be. On the contrary, from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would, probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duties. There was no reason to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going under an assumed name.
<p/>I therefore organized my Street Arab detective corps, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted.
<p/>Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) change his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name in a country where no one knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) original one? How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection.
<p/>The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented.
<p/>Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised. You see the whole thing is a chain of logical sequences without a break or flaw.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``It is wonderful! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. '' Your merits should be publicly recognized. You should publish an account of the case.
<p/>If you won't, I will for you. '' <div class="bookquote">``You may do what you like, Doctor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``See here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) continued, handing a paper over to me, <div class="bookquote">``look at this!
<p/>It was the Echo for the day, and the paragraph to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) pointed was devoted to the case in question.
<p/>The public,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>it said, <div class="bookquote">``have lost a sensational treat through the sudden death of the man Hope, who was suspected of the murder of Mr. Enoch Drebber and of Mr. Joseph Stangerson.
<p/>The details of the case will probably be never known now, though we are informed upon good authority that the crime was the result of an old standing and romantic feud, in which love and Mormonism bore a part.
<p/>It seems that both the victims belonged, in their younger days, to the Latter Day Saints, and Hope, the deceased prisoner, hails also from Salt Lake City.
<p/>If the case has had no other effect, it, at least, brings out in the most striking manner the efficiency of our detective police force, and will serve as a lesson to all foreigners that they will do wisely to settle their feuds at home, and not to carry them on to British soil.
<p/>It is an open secret that the credit of this smart capture belongs entirely to the well-known Scotland Yard officials, Messrs. Lestrade and Gregson.
<p/>The man was apprehended, it appears, in the rooms of a certain Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who has himself, as an amateur, shown some talent in the detective line, and who, with such instructors, may hope in time to attain to some degree of their skill.
<p/>It is expected that a testimonial of some sort will be presented to the two officers as a fitting recognition of their services.''
