<p/>It was four o'clock when the ceremony was over and the carriages began to arrive. There had been a crowd following all the way, owing to the exuberance of Marija Berczynskas.
<p/>The occasion rested heavily upon Marija's broad shoulders--it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) task to see that all things went in due form, and after the best home traditions; and, flying wildly hither and thither, bowling every one out of the way, and scolding and exhorting all day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) tremendous voice, Marija was too eager to see that others conformed to the proprieties to consider them herself.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) had left the church last of all, and, desiring to arrive first at the hall, had issued orders to the coachman to drive faster.
<p/>When that personage had developed a will of his (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) own in the matter, Marija had flung up the window of the carriage, and, leaning out, proceeded to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>), first in Lithuanian, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) did not understand, and then in Polish, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) did.
<p/>Having the advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Christy</b></font>) in altitude, the driver had stood his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) ground and even ventured to attempt to speak; and the result had been a furious altercation, which, continuing all the way down Ashland Avenue, had added a new swarm of urchins to the cortege at each side street for half a mile.
<p/>The music had started up, and half a block away you could hear the dull <div class="bookquote">``broom, broom''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of a cello, with the squeaking of two fiddles which vied with each other in intricate and altitudinous gymnastics.
<p/>Seeing the throng, Marija abandoned precipitately the debate concerning the ancestors of her (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>) coachman, and, springing from the moving carriage, plunged in and proceeded to clear a way to the hall.
<p/>This was unfortunate, for already there was a throng before the door. Once within, she (<font color='blue'><b>ancestors</b></font>) turned and began to push the other way, roaring, meantime,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eik! Eik! Uzdaryk-duris!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in tones which made the orchestral uproar sound like fairy music. '' Z. Graiczunas, Pasilinksminimams darzas. Vynas. Sznapsas.
<p/>The reader, who perhaps has never held much converse in the language of far-off Lithuania, will be glad of the explanation that the place was the rear room of a saloon in that part of Chicago known as <div class="bookquote">``back of the yards.
<p/>This information is definite and suited to the matter of fact; but how pitifully inadequate it would have seemed to one who understood that it was also the supreme hour of ecstasy in the life of one of God's gentlest creatures, the scene of the wedding feast and the joy-transfiguration of little Ona Lukoszaite!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood in the doorway, shepherded by Cousin Marija, breathless from pushing through the crowd, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) happiness painful to look upon.
<p/>There was a light of wonder in her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lids trembled, and her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) otherwise wan little face was flushed.
<p/>Wines and Liquors. Union Headquarters'' (<font color='red'><b>The reader</b></font>)</div>--that was the way the signs ran. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wore a muslin dress, conspicuously white, and a stiff little veil coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>There were five pink paper roses twisted in the veil, and eleven bright green rose leaves. There were new white cotton gloves upon her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood staring about her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
<p/>It was almost too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--you could see the pain of too great emotion in her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face, and all the tremor of her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) form.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was so young--not quite sixteen--and small for her (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) age, a mere child; and she (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had just been married--and married to Jurgis,*
<p/>-LRB-*Pronounced Yoorghis-RRB- of all men, to Jurgis Rudkus, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with the white flower in the buttonhole of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) new black suit, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with the mighty shoulders and the giant hands.
<p/>Ona was blue-eyed and fair, while Jurgis had great black eyes with beetling brows, and thick black hair that curled in waves about his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ears--in short, they were one of those incongruous and impossible married couples with which Mother Nature so often wills to confound all prophets, before and after.
<p/>Jurgis could take up a two-hundred-and-fifty-pound quarter of beef and carry it into a car without a stagger, or even a thought; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood in a far corner, frightened as a hunted animal, and obliged to moisten his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lips with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) tongue each time before he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could answer the congratulations of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) friends.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) twisted them together feverishly. Gradually there was effected a separation between the spectators and the guests--a separation at least sufficiently complete for working purposes.
<p/>There was no time during the festivities which ensued when there were not groups of onlookers in the doorways and the corners; and if any one of these onlookers came sufficiently close, or looked sufficiently hungry, a chair was offered him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was invited to the feast.
<p/>It was one of the laws of the veselija that no one goes hungry; and, while a rule made in the forests of Lithuania is hard to apply in the stockyards district of Chicago, with its quarter of a million inhabitants, still they did their best, and the children who ran in from the street, and even the dogs, went out again happier.
<p/>The men wore their hats, or, if they wished, they took them off, and their coats with them; they ate when and where they pleased, and moved as often as they pleased.
<p/>There were to be speeches and singing, but no one had to listen who did not care to; if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wished, meantime, to speak or sing himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was perfectly free.
<p/>The resulting medley of sound distracted no one, save possibly alone the babies, of which there were present a number equal to the total possessed by all the guests invited.
<p/>There was no other place for the babies to be, and so part of the preparations for the evening consisted of a collection of cribs and carriages in one corner.
<p/>A charming informality was one of the characteristics of this celebration. In these the babies slept, three or four together, or wakened together, as the case might be.
<p/>The room is about thirty feet square, with whitewashed walls, bare save for a calendar, a picture of a race horse, and a family tree in a gilded frame.
<p/>To the right there is a door from the saloon, with a few loafers in the doorway, and in the corner beyond it a bar, with a presiding genius clad in soiled white, with waxed black mustaches and a carefully oiled curl plastered against one side of his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>In the opposite corner are two tables, filling a third of the room and laden with dishes and cold viands, which a few of the hungrier guests are already munching.
<p/>At the head, where sits the bride, is a snow-white cake, with an Eiffel tower of constructed decoration, with sugar roses and two angels upon it, and a generous sprinkling of pink and green and yellow candies.
<p/>Beyond opens a door into the kitchen, where there is a glimpse to be had of a range with much steam ascending from it, and many women, old and young, rushing hither and thither.
<p/>In the corner to the left are the three musicians, upon a little platform, toiling heroically to make some impression upon the hubbub; also the babies, similarly occupied, and an open window whence the populace imbibes the sights and sounds and odors.
<p/>Suddenly some of the steam begins to advance, and, peering through it, you discern Aunt Elizabeth, Ona's stepmother--Teta Elzbieta, as they call her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>)--bearing aloft a great platter of stewed duck.
<p/>Those who were still older, and could reach the tables, marched about munching contentedly at meat bones and bologna sausages. Behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) is Kotrina, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) way cautiously, staggering beneath a similar burden; and
<p/>half a minute later there appears old Grandmother Majauszkiene, with a big yellow bowl of smoking potatoes, nearly as big as herself.
<p/>So, bit by bit, the feast takes form--there is a ham and a dish of sauerkraut, boiled rice, macaroni, bologna sausages, great piles of penny buns, bowls of milk, and foaming pitchers of beer.
<p/>There is also, not six feet from your back, the bar, where you may order all you please and do not have to pay for it.
<p/>'' screams Marija Berczynskas, and falls to work herself--for there is more upon the stove inside that will be spoiled if it be not eaten.
<p/>The young men, who for the most part have been huddled near the door, summon their resolution and advance; and the shrinking Jurgis is poked and scolded by the old folks until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) consents to seat himself at the right hand of the bride.
<p/>The two bridesmaids, whose insignia of office are paper wreaths, come next, and after them the rest of the guests, old and young, boys and girls.
<p/>The spirit of the occasion takes hold of the stately bartender, who condescends to a plate of stewed duck; even the fat policeman--whose duty it will be, later in the evening, to break up the fights--draws up a chair to the foot of the table.
<p/>And the children shout and the babies yell, and every one laughs and sings and chatters--while above all the deafening clamor Cousin Marija shouts orders to the musicians.
<p/>'' Eiksz! Graicziau! So, with laughter and shouts and endless badinage and merriment, the guests take their places. The musicians--how shall one begin to describe them?
<p/>All this time they have been there, playing in a mad frenzy--all of this scene must be read, or said, or sung, to music.
<p/>It is the music which makes it what it is; it is the music which changes the place from the rear room of a saloon in back of the yards to a fairy place, a wonderland, a little corner of the high mansions of the sky.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) fiddle is out of tune, and there is no rosin on his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) bow, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) is an inspired man--the hands of the muses have been laid upon him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).
<p/>The little person who leads this trio is an inspired man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plays like one possessed by a demon, by a whole horde of demons.
<p/>You can feel them in the air round about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), capering frenetically; with their invisible feet they set the pace, and the hair of the leader of the orchestra rises on end, and his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) eyeballs start from their sockets, as he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) toils to keep up with them.
<p/>Tamoszius Kuszleika is his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) name, and he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) has taught himself to play the violin by practicing all night, after working all day on the <div class="bookquote">``killing beds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) shirt sleeves, with a vest figured with faded gold horseshoes, and a pink-striped shirt, suggestive of peppermint candy.
<p/>A pair of military trousers, light blue with a yellow stripe, serve to give that suggestion of authority proper to the leader of a band.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) is only about five feet high, but even so these trousers are about eight inches short of the ground.
<p/>You wonder where he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) can have gotten them or rather you would wonder, if the excitement of being in his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) presence left you time to think of such things.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) stamps with his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) tosses his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) sways and swings to and fro; he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) has a wizened-up little face, irresistibly comical; and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) executes a turn or a flourish, his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) brows knit and his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) lips work and his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) eyelids wink--
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) is an inspired man. Every inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) is inspired--you might almost say inspired separately. the very ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) necktie bristle out.
<p/>And every now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) turns upon his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) companions, nodding, signaling, beckoning frantically--with every inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) appealing, imploring, in behalf of the muses and their call.
<p/>The second violin is a Slovak, a tall, gaunt man with black-rimmed spectacles and the mute and patient look of an overdriven mule; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) responds to the whip but feebly, and then always falls back into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old rut.
<p/>The third man is very fat, with a round, red, sentimental nose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plays with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes turned up to the sky and a look of infinite yearning.
<p/>For they are hardly worthy of Tamoszius, the other two members of the orchestra. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is playing a bass part upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cello, and so the excitement is nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<p/>; no matter what happens in the treble, it is his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) task to saw out one long-drawn and lugubrious note after another, from four o'clock in the afternoon until nearly the same hour next morning, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) third of the total income of one dollar per hour.
<p/>Before the feast has been five minutes under way, Tamoszius Kuszleika has risen in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excitement; a minute or two more
<p/>and you see that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is beginning to edge over toward the tables. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nostrils are dilated and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath comes fast--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) demons are driving him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nods and shakes his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companions, jerking at them with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) violin, until at last the long form of the second violinist also rises up.
<p/>In the end all three of them begin advancing, step by step, upon the banqueters, Valentinavyczia, the cellist, bumping along with his (<font color='blue'><b>cellist</b></font>) instrument between notes.
<p/>Finally all three are gathered at the foot of the tables, and there Tamoszius mounts upon a stool. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>cellist</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>cellist</b></font>) glory, dominating the scene.
<p/>Some of the people are eating, some are laughing and talking--but you will make a great mistake if you think there is one of them who does not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>cellist</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>cellist</b></font>) notes are never true, and his (<font color='blue'><b>cellist</b></font>) fiddle buzzes on the low ones and squeaks and scratches on the high; but these things they heed no more than they heed the dirt and noise and squalor about them--
<p/>it is out of this material that they have to build their lives, with it that they have to utter their souls.
<p/>And this is their utterance; merry and boisterous, or mournful and wailing, or passionate and rebellious, this music is their music, music of home.
<p/>It stretches out its arms to them, they have only to give themselves up. Chicago and its saloons and its slums fade away--there are green meadows and sunlit rivers, mighty forests and snow-clad hills.
<p/>They behold home landscapes and childhood scenes returning; old loves and friendships begin to waken, old joys and griefs to laugh and weep.
<p/>Now and then one leaps up with a cry and calls for this song or that; and then the fire leaps brighter in Tamoszius' eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) flings up his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) fiddle and shouts to his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) companions, and away they go in mad career.
<p/>The company takes up the choruses, and men and women cry out like all possessed; some leap to their feet and stamp upon the floor, lifting their glasses and pledging each other.
<p/>Before long it occurs to some one to demand an old wedding song, which celebrates the beauty of the bride and the joys of love.
<p/>In the excitement of this masterpiece Tamoszius Kuszleika begins to edge in between the tables, making his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) way toward the head, where sits the bride.
<p/>There is not a foot of space between the chairs of the guests, and Tamoszius is so short that he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) pokes them with his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) bow whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) reaches over for the low notes; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) presses in, and insists relentlessly that his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) companions must follow.
<p/>During their progress, needless to say, the sounds of the cello are pretty well extinguished; but at last the three are at the head, and Tamoszius takes his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) station at the right hand of the bride and begins to pour out his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) soul in melting strains.
<p/>Once in a while she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) tastes a little something, when Cousin Marija pinches her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) elbow and reminds her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>); but, for the most part, she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) sits gazing with the same fearful eyes of wonder.
<p/>Some fall back and close their eyes, some beat upon the table. Little Ona is too excited to eat. Teta Elzbieta is all in a flutter, like a hummingbird; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) sisters, too, keep running up behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), whispering, breathless.
<p/>But Ona seems scarcely to hear them--the music keeps calling, and the far-off look comes back, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) sits with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hands pressed together over her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) heart.
<p/>Then the tears begin to come into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) eyes; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) is ashamed to wipe them away, and ashamed to let them run down her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) cheeks, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) turns and shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) head a little, and then flushes red when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) sees that Jurgis is watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>When in the end Tamoszius Kuszleika has reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) side, and is waving his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) magic wand above her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), Ona's cheeks are scarlet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would have to get up and run away.
<p/>Marija is fond of a song, a song of lovers' parting; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) wishes to hear it, and, as the musicians do not know it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) has risen, and is proceeding to teach them.
<p/>In this crisis, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) is saved by Marija Berczynskas, whom the muses suddenly visit. Marija is short, but powerful in build.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) works in a canning factory, and all day long she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) handles cans of beef that weigh fourteen pounds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) has a broad Slavic face, with prominent red cheeks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) wears a blue flannel shirt-waist, which is now rolled up at the sleeves, disclosing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) brawny arms; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) has a carving fork in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hand, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) pounds on the table to mark the time.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) roars her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) song, in a voice of which it is enough to say that it leaves no portion of the room vacant, the three musicians follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), laboriously and note by note, but averaging one note behind; thus they toil through stanza after stanza of a lovesick swain's lamentation:--
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) opens her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) mouth, it is tragical, but you cannot help thinking of a horse. <div class="bookquote">``Sudiev' kvietkeli, tu brangiausis; Sudiev' ir laime, man biednam, Matau--paskyre teip Aukszcziausis, Jog vargt ant svieto reik vienam!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Antanas/Dede Antanas</b></font>)</div>When the song is over, it is time for the speech, and old Dede Antanas rises to his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) feet. Grandfather Anthony, Jurgis' father, is not more than sixty years of age, but you would think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) was eighty.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) manhood he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) worked in a cotton mill, but then a coughing fell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) had to leave; out in the country the trouble disappeared, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) has been working in the pickle rooms at Durham's, and the breathing of the cold, damp air all day has brought it back.
<p/>Now as he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) rises he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) is seized with a coughing fit, and holds himself by his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) chair and turns away his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) wan and battered face until it passes.
<p/>Generally it is the custom for the speech at a veselija to be taken out of one of the books and learned by heart; but in his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) youthful days Dede Antanas used to be a scholar, and really make up all the love letters of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) friends.
<p/>Now it is understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) has composed an original speech of congratulation and benediction, and this is one of the events of the day.
<p/>Even the boys, who are romping about the room, draw near and listen, and some of the women sob and wipe their aprons in their eyes.
<p/>It is very solemn, for Antanas Rudkus has become possessed of the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) has not much longer to stay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) children.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) speech leaves them all so tearful that one of the guests, Jokubas Szedvilas, who keeps a delicatessen store on Halsted Street, and is fat and hearty, is moved to rise and say that things may not be as bad as that, and then to go on and make a little speech of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) own, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) showers congratulations and prophecies of happiness upon the bride and groom, proceeding to particulars which greatly delight the young men, but which cause Ona to blush more furiously than ever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) has been only six months in America, and the change has not done him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) good. Jokubas possesses what his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) wife complacently describes as <div class="bookquote">``poetiszka vaidintuve'' (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>--a poetical imagination.
<p/>Now a good many of the guests have finished, and, since there is no pretense of ceremony, the banquet begins to break up.
<p/>Some of the men gather about the bar; some wander about, laughing and singing; here and there will be a little group, chanting merrily, and in sublime indifference to the others and to the orchestra as well.
<p/>The last tardy diners are scarcely given time to finish, before the tables and the debris are shoved into the corner, and the chairs and the babies piled out of the way, and the real celebration of the evening begins.
<p/>Then Tamoszius Kuszleika, after replenishing himself with a pot of beer, returns to his (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) platform, and, standing up, reviews the scene; he (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) taps authoritatively upon the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) violin, then tucks it carefully under his (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) chin, then waves his (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) bow in an elaborate flourish, and finally smites the sounding strings and closes his (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) eyes, and floats away in spirit upon the wings of a dreamy waltz.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) companion follows, but with his (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) eyes open, watching where he (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) treads, so to speak; and finally Valentinavyczia, after waiting for a little and beating with his (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) foot to get the time, casts up his (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) eyes to the ceiling and begins to saw--<div class="bookquote">``Broom!
<p/>Everybody is more or less restless--one would guess that something is on their minds. And so it proves. broom! broom! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Apparently nobody knows how to waltz, but that is nothing of any consequence--there is music, and they dance, each as he (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) pleases, just as before they sang.
<p/>The company pairs off quickly, and the whole room is soon in motion. Most of them prefer the <div class="bookquote">``two-step,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>especially the young, with whom it is the fashion.
<p/>Some do not dance anything at all, but simply hold each other's hands and allow the undisciplined joy of motion to express itself with their feet.
<p/>Among these are Jokubas Szedvilas and his (<font color='blue'><b>diners</b></font>) wife, Lucija, who together keep the delicatessen store, and consume nearly as much as they sell; they are too fat to dance, but they stand in the middle of the floor, holding each other fast in their arms, rocking slowly from side to side and grinning seraphically, a picture of toothless and perspiring ecstasy.
<p/>Of these older people many wear clothing reminiscent in some detail of home--an embroidered waistcoat or stomacher, or a gaily colored handkerchief, or a coat with large cuffs and fancy buttons.
<p/>All these things are carefully avoided by the young, most of whom have learned to speak English and to affect the latest style of clothing.
<p/>The older people have dances from home, strange and complicated steps which they execute with grave solemnity. The girls wear ready-made dresses or shirt waists, and some of them look quite pretty.
<p/>Some of the young men you would take to be Americans, of the type of clerks, but for the fact that they wear their hats in the room.
<p/>Each of these younger couples affects a style of its own in dancing. Some hold each other tightly, some at a cautious distance.
<p/>Some hold their hands out stiffly, some drop them loosely at their sides. Some dance springily, some glide softly, some move with grave dignity.
<p/>There are boisterous couples, who tear wildly about the room, knocking every one out of their way. There are nervous couples, whom these frighten, and who cry, <div class="bookquote">``Nusfok!
<p/>Kas yra? ''  (<font color='red'><b>couples</b></font>)</div>at them as they pass. Each couple is paired for the evening--you will never see them change about.
<p/>There is Alena Jasaityte, for instance, who has danced unending hours with Juozas Raczius, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jasaityte</b></font>) is engaged. Alena is the beauty of the evening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) would be really beautiful if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) were not so proud.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) wears a white shirtwaist, which represents, perhaps, half a week's labor painting cans. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) skirt with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) hand as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) dances, with stately precision, after the manner of the grandes dames.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) affects a <div class="bookquote">``tough''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>aspect, wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) hat on one side and keeping a cigarette in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) mouth all the evening.
<p/>Juozas is driving one of Durham's wagons, and is making big wages. Then there is Jadvyga Marcinkus, who is also beautiful, but humble.
<p/>Jadvyga likewise paints cans, but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) has an invalid mother and three little sisters to support by it, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) does not spend her (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) wages for shirtwaists.
<p/>Jadvyga is small and delicate, with jet-black eyes and hair, the latter twisted into a little knot and tied on the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) head.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) wears an old white dress which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) has made herself and worn to parties for the past five years; it is high-waisted--almost under her (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) arms, and not very becoming,--but
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) is small, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) is big and powerful; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) nestles in his (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) arms as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) would hide herself from view, and leans her (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) in turn has clasped his (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) arms tightly around her (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) would carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) away; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) dances, and will dance the entire evening, and would dance forever, in ecstasy of bliss.
<p/>that does not trouble Jadvyga, who is dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) Mikolas. You would smile, perhaps, to see them--but you would not smile if you knew all the story.
<p/>They would have been married in the beginning, only Mikolas has a father who is drunk all day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is the only other man in a large family.
<p/>Even so they might have managed it -LRB-for Mikolas is a skilled man-RRB- but for cruel accidents which have almost taken the heart out of them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a beef-boner, and that is a dangerous trade, especially when you are on piecework and trying to earn a bride.
<p/>Your hands are slippery, and your knife is slippery, and you are toiling like mad, when somebody happens to speak to you, or you strike a bone.
<p/>This is the fifth year, now, that Jadvyga has been engaged to Mikolas, and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) heart is sick. Then your hand slips up on the blade, and there is a fearful gash.
<p/>And that would not be so bad, only for the deadly contagion. The cut may heal, but you never can tell.
<p/>Twice now; within the last three years, Mikolas has been lying at home with blood poisoning--once for three months and once for nearly seven.
<p/>The last time, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mikolas</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Mikolas</b></font>) job, and that meant six weeks more of standing at the doors of the packing houses, at six o'clock on bitter winter mornings, with a foot of snow on the ground and more in the air.
<p/>There are learned people who can tell you out of the statistics that beef-boners make forty cents an hour, but, perhaps, these people have never looked into a beef-boner's hands.
<p/>When Tamoszius and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mikolas</b></font>) companions stop for a rest, as perforce they must, now and then, the dancers halt where they are and wait patiently.
<p/>It is only for a minute, anyway, for the leader starts up again, in spite of all the protests of the other two.
<p/>They never seem to tire; and there is no place for them to sit down if they did. This time it is another sort of a dance, a Lithuanian dance.
<p/>Those who prefer to, go on with the two-step, but the majority go through an intricate series of motions, resembling more fancy skating than a dance.
<p/>This is quite irresistible, and every one in the room joins in, until the place becomes a maze of flying skirts and bodies quite dazzling to look upon.
<p/>The climax of it is a furious prestissimo, at which the couples seize hands and begin a mad whirling. But the sight of sights at this moment is Tamoszius Kuszleika.
<p/>The sweat starts out on his (<font color='blue'><b>majority</b></font>) forehead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>majority</b></font>) bends over like a cyclist on the last lap of a race.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>majority</b></font>) body shakes and throbs like a runaway steam engine, and the ear cannot follow the flying showers of notes--there is a pale blue mist where you look to see his (<font color='blue'><b>majority</b></font>) bowing arm.
<p/>With a most wonderful rush he (<font color='blue'><b>majority</b></font>) comes to the end of the tune, and flings up his (<font color='blue'><b>majority</b></font>) hands and staggers back exhausted; and with a final shout of delight the dancers fly apart, reeling here and there, bringing up against the walls of the room.
<p/>After this there is beer for every one, the musicians included, and the revelers take a long breath and prepare for the great event of the evening, which is the acziavimas.
<p/>The acziavimas is a ceremony which, once begun, will continue for three or four hours, and it involves one uninterrupted dance.
<p/>The guests form a great ring, locking hands, and, when the music starts up, begin to move around in a circle.
<p/>The old fiddle squeaks and shrieks in protest, but Tamoszius has no mercy. In the center stands the bride, and, one by one, the men step into the enclosure and dance with her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>).
<p/>Each dances for several minutes--as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tamoszius</b></font>) pleases; it is a very merry proceeding, with laughter and singing, and when the guest has finished, he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) finds himself face to face with Teta Elzbieta, who holds the hat.
<p/>Into it he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) drops a sum of money--a dollar, or perhaps five dollars, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) power, and his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) estimate of the value of the privilege.
<p/>The guests are expected to pay for this entertainment; if they be proper guests, they will see that there is a neat sum left over for the bride and bridegroom to start life upon.
<p/>They will certainly be over two hundred dollars and maybe three hundred; and three hundred dollars is more than the year's income of many a person in this room.
<p/>There are able-bodied men here who work from early morning until late at night, in ice-cold cellars with a quarter of an inch of water on the floor--men who for six or seven months in the year never see the sunlight from Sunday afternoon till the next Sunday morning--and who cannot earn three hundred dollars in a year.
<p/>There are little children here, scarce in their teens, who can hardly see the top of the work benches--whose parents have lied to get them their places--and who do not make the half of three hundred dollars a year, and perhaps not even the third of it.
<p/>Most fearful they are to contemplate, the expenses of this entertainment. And then to spend such a sum, all in a single day of your life, at a wedding feast!
<p/>-LRB-For obviously it is the same thing, whether you spend it at once for your own wedding, or in a long time, at the weddings of all your friends.-RRB-
<p/>Bit by bit these poor people have given up everything else; but to this they cling with all the power of their souls--they cannot give up the veselija!
<p/>To do that would mean, not merely to be defeated, but to acknowledge defeat--and the difference between these two things is what keeps the world going.
<p/>The veselija has come down to them from a far-off time; and the meaning of it was that one might dwell within the cave and gaze upon shadows, provided only that once in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lifetime he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) could break his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) chains, and feel his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) wings, and behold the sun;
<p/>provided that once in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lifetime he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) might testify to the fact that life, with all its cares and its terrors, is no such great thing after all, but merely a bubble upon the surface of a river, a thing that one may toss about and play with as a juggler tosses his (<font color='blue'><b>juggler</b></font>) golden balls, a thing that one may quaff, like a goblet of rare red wine.
<p/>Thus having known himself for the master of things, a man could go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) toil and live upon the memory all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days.
<p/>It is very imprudent, it is tragic--but, ah, it is so beautiful! Endlessly the dancers swung round and round--when they were dizzy they swung the other way.
<p/>Hour after hour this had continued--the darkness had fallen and the room was dim from the light of two smoky oil lamps.
<p/>The musicians had spent all their fine frenzy by now, and played only one tune, wearily, ploddingly. There were twenty bars or so of it, and when they came to the end they began again.
<p/>Once every ten minutes or so they would fail to begin again, but instead would sink back exhausted; a circumstance which invariably brought on a painful and terrifying scene, that made the fat policeman stir uneasily in his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) sleeping place behind the door.
<p/>It was all Marija Berczynskas. Marija was one of those hungry souls who cling with desperation to the skirts of the retreating muse.
<p/>All day long she (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) had been in a state of wonderful exaltation; and now it was leaving--and she (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) would not let it go.
<p/>Whether it was by beer, or by shouting, or by music, or by motion, she (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) meant that it should not go.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) would go back to the chase of it--and no sooner be fairly started than her (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) chariot would be thrown off the track, so to speak, by the stupidity of those thrice accursed musicians.
<p/>Each time, Marija would emit a howl and fly at them, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>muse</b></font>) fists in their faces, stamping upon the floor, purple and incoherent with rage.
<p/>In vain the frightened Tamoszius would attempt to speak, to plead the limitations of the flesh; in vain would the puffing and breathless ponas Jokubas insist, in vain would Teta Elzbieta implore.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) soul cried out in the words of Faust, <div class="bookquote">``Stay, thou art fair!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Szalin!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>Marija would scream. '' Palauk! isz kelio!
<p/>And so, in sheer terror, the orchestra would strike up again, and Marija would return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) place and take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) task.
<p/>Ona was kept up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) excitement, but all of the women and most of the men were tired--the soul of Marija was alone unconquered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) drove on the dancers--what had once been the ring had now the shape of a pear, with Marija at the stem, pulling one way and pushing the other, shouting, stamping, singing, a very volcano of energy.
<p/>What are you paid for, children of hell? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) bore all the burden of the festivities now. Now and then some one coming in or out would leave the door open, and the night air was chill;
<p/>Marija as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) passed would stretch out her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) foot and kick the doorknob, and slam would go the door! Once this procedure was the cause of a calamity of which Sebastijonas Szedvilas was the hapless victim.
<p/>Little Sebastijonas, aged three, had been wandering about oblivious to all things, holding turned up over his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) mouth a bottle of liquid known as <div class="bookquote">``pop,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>pink-colored, ice-cold, and delicious.
<p/>Marija, who threatened horrid murder a hundred times a day, and would weep over the injury of a fly, seized little Sebastijonas in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) arms and bid fair to smother him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) with kisses.
<p/>There was a long rest for the orchestra, and plenty of refreshments, while Marija was making her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) peace with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) victim, seating him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) upon the bar, and standing beside him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) and holding to his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) lips a foaming schooner of beer.
<p/>In the meantime there was going on in another corner of the room an anxious conference between Teta Elzbieta and Dede Antanas, and a few of the more intimate friends of the family.
<p/>Passing through the doorway the door smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) full, and the shriek which followed brought the dancing to a halt. A trouble was come upon them.
<p/>Every one's share was different--and yet every one knew perfectly well what his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) share was, and strove to give a little more.
<p/>Now, however, since they had come to the new country, all this was changing; it seemed as if there must be some subtle poison in the air that one breathed here--it was affecting all the young men at once.
<p/>The veselija is a compact, a compact not expressed, but therefore only the more binding upon all. They would come in crowds and fill themselves with a fine dinner, and then sneak off.
<p/>One would throw another's hat out of the window, and both would go out to get it, and neither could be seen again.
<p/>Or now and then half a dozen of them would get together and march out openly, staring at you, and making fun of you to your face.
<p/>Still others, worse yet, would crowd about the bar, and at the expense of the host drink themselves sodden, paying not the least attention to any one, and leaving it to be thought that either they had danced with the bride already, or meant to later on.
<p/>All these things were going on now, and the family was helpless with dismay. So long they had toiled, and such an outlay they had made!
<p/>Those frightful bills--how they had haunted her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>), each item gnawing at her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) soul all day and spoiling her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) rest at night.
<p/>How often she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had named them over one by one and figured on them as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) went to work--fifteen dollars for the hall, twenty-two dollars and a quarter for the ducks, twelve dollars for the musicians, five dollars at the church, and a blessing of the Virgin besides--and so on without an end!
<p/>Worst of all was the frightful bill that was still to come from Graiczunas for the beer and liquor that might be consumed.
<p/>One could never get in advance more than a guess as to this from a saloon-keeper--and then, when the time came he (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) always came to you scratching his (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) head and saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had guessed too low, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) best--your guests had gotten so very drunk.
<p/>By him (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) you were sure to be cheated unmercifully, and that even though you thought yourself the dearest of the hundreds of friends he (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) had.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) would begin to serve your guests out of a keg that was half full, and finish with one that was half empty, and then you would be charged for two kegs of beer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) would agree to serve a certain quality at a certain price, and when the time came you and your friends would be drinking some horrible poison that could not be described.
<p/>You might complain, but you would get nothing for your pains but a ruined evening; while, as for going to law about it, you might as well go to heaven at once.
<p/>The saloon-keeper stood in with all the big politics men in the district; and when you had once found out what it meant to get into trouble with such people, you would know enough to pay what you were told to pay and shut up.
<p/>What made all this the more painful was that it was so hard on the few that had really done their best.
<p/>There was poor old ponas Jokubas, for instance--he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had already given five dollars, and did not every one know that Jokubas Szedvilas had just mortgaged his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) delicatessen store for two hundred dollars to meet several months' overdue rent?
<p/>And then there was withered old poni Aniele--who was a widow, and had three children, and the rheumatism besides, and did washing for the tradespeople on Halsted Street at prices it would break your heart to hear named.
<p/>Ona stood by, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) eyes wide with terror. Aniele had given the entire profit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) chickens for several months. Eight of them she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) owned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) kept them in a little place fenced around on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) backstairs.
<p/>All day long the children of Aniele were raking in the dump for food for these chickens; and sometimes, when the competition there was too fierce, you might see them on Halsted Street walking close to the gutters, and with their mother following to see that no one robbed them of their finds.
<p/>Money could not tell the value of these chickens to old Mrs. Jukniene--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jukniene</b></font>) valued them differently, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jukniene</b></font>) had a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jukniene</b></font>) was getting something for nothing by means of them--that with them she (<font color='blue'><b>Jukniene</b></font>) was getting the better of a world that was getting the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jukniene</b></font>) in so many other ways.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Jukniene</b></font>) watched them every hour of the day, and had learned to see like an owl at night to watch them then.
<p/>One of them had been stolen long ago, and not a month passed that some one did not try to steal another.
<p/>As the frustrating of this one attempt involved a score of false alarms, it will be understood what a tribute old Mrs. Jukniene brought, just because Teta Elzbieta had once loaned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) some money for a few days and saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) from being turned out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) house.
<p/>Some drew nearer, hoping to overhear the conversation, who were themselves among the guilty--and surely that was a thing to try the patience of a saint.
<p/>More and more friends gathered round while the lamentation about these things was going on. Finally there came Jurgis, urged by some one, and
<p/>the story was retold to him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>). Jurgis listened in silence, with his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) great black eyebrows knitted. Now and then there would come a gleam underneath them and he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) would glance about the room.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) would have liked to go at some of those fellows with his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) big clenched fists; but then, doubtless, he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) realized how little good it would do him (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>).
<p/>No bill would be any less for turning out any one at this time; and then there would be the scandal--and Jurgis wanted nothing except to get away with Ona and to let the world go its own way.
<p/>So his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) hands relaxed and he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) merely said quietly: <div class="bookquote">``It is done, and there is no use in weeping, Teta Elzbieta.
<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) look turned toward Ona, who stood close to his (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) side, and he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) saw the wide look of terror in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Little one,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) said, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``do not worry--it will not matter to us. We will pay them all somehow.
<p/>I will work harder. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>That was always what Jurgis said. Ona had grown used to it as the solution of all difficulties--<div class="bookquote">``I will work harder!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ona/Little Ona</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>saint</b></font>) had said that in Lithuania when one official had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) passport from him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>), and another had arrested him (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) for being without it, and the two had divided a third of his (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) belongings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>official</b></font>) had said it again in New York, when the smooth-spoken agent had taken them in hand and made them pay such high prices, and almost prevented their leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) place, in spite of their paying.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) said it a third time, and Ona drew a deep breath; it was so wonderful to have a husband, just like a grown woman--and a husband who could solve all problems, and who was so big and strong!
<p/>The ceremony begins again--but there are few now left to dance with, and so very soon the collection is over and promiscuous dances once more begin.
<p/>The last sob of little Sebastijonas has been stifled, and the orchestra has once more been reminded of its duty. It is now after midnight, however, and things are not as they were before.
<p/>The dancers are dull and heavy--most of them have been drinking hard, and have long ago passed the stage of exhilaration.
<p/>They dance in monotonous measure, round after round, hour after hour, with eyes fixed upon vacancy, as if they were only half conscious, in a constantly growing stupor.
<p/>The men grasp the women very tightly, but there will be half an hour together when neither will see the other's face.
<p/>Others, who have been drinking still more, wander about the room, bumping into everything; some are in groups of two or three, singing,
<p/>Some couples do not care to dance, and have retired to the corners, where they sit with their arms enlaced. each group its own song.
<p/>Some stagger about in each other's arms, whispering maudlin words--others start quarrels upon the slightest pretext, and come to blows and have to be pulled apart.
<p/>As time goes on there is a variety of drunkenness, among the younger men especially. Now the fat policeman wakens definitely, and feels of his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) club to see that it is ready for business.
<p/>if they once get out of hand, are like a forest fire, and may mean the whole reserves at the station.
<p/>The thing to do is to crack every fighting head that you see, before there are so many fighting heads that you cannot crack any of them.
<p/>There is but scant account kept of cracked heads in back of the yards, for men who have to crack the heads of animals all day seem to get into the habit, and to practice on their friends, and even on their families, between times.
<p/>This makes it a cause for congratulation that by modern methods a very few men can do the painfully necessary work of head-cracking for the whole of the cultured world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) has to be prompt--for these two-o'clock-in-the-morning fights, There is no fight that night--perhaps because Jurgis, too, is watchful--even more so than the policeman.
<p/>Jurgis has drunk a great deal, as any one naturally would on an occasion when it all has to be paid for, whether it is drunk or not; but he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) is a very steady man, and does not easily lose his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) temper.
<p/>Marija has apparently concluded about two hours ago that if the altar in the corner, with the deity in soiled white, be not the true home of the muses, it is, at any rate, the nearest substitute on earth attainable.
<p/>And Marija is just fighting drunk when there come to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ears the facts about the villains who have not paid that night.
<p/>Marija goes on the warpath straight off, without even the preliminary of a good cursing, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is pulled off it is with the coat collars of two villains in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Fortunately, the policeman is disposed to be reasonable, and so it is not Marija who is flung out of the place.
<p/>Only once there is a tight shave--and that is the fault of Marija Berczynskas. All this interrupts the music for not more than a minute or two.
<p/>It is an American tune this time, one which they have picked up on the streets; all seem to know the words of it--or, at any rate, the first line of it, which they hum to themselves, over and over again without rest: <div class="bookquote">``In the good old summertime--in the good old summertime!
<p/>Then again the merciless tune begins--the tune that has been played for the last half-hour without one single change. In the good old summertime--in the good old summertime!
<p/>It has put a stupor upon every one who hears it, as well as upon the men who are playing it.
<p/>No one can get away from it, or even think of getting away from it; it is three o'clock in the morning, and they have danced out all their joy, and danced out all their strength, and all the strength that unlimited drink can lend them--and still there is no one among them who has the power to think of stopping.
<p/>Promptly at seven o'clock this same Monday morning they will every one of them have to be in their places at Durham's or Brown's or Jones's, each in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) working clothes.
<p/>If one of them be a minute late, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) will be docked an hour's pay, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) be many minutes late, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) will be apt to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) brass check turned to the wall, which will send him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) out to join the hungry mob that waits every morning at the gates of the packing houses, from six o'clock until nearly half-past eight.
<p/>There is no exception to this rule, not even little Ona--who has asked for a holiday the day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) wedding day, a holiday without pay, and been refused.
<p/>While there are so many who are anxious to work as you wish, there is no occasion for incommoding yourself with those who must work otherwise.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There seems to be something hypnotic about this, with its endlessly recurring dominant. Little Ona is nearly ready to faint--and half in a stupor herself, because of the heavy scent in the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) has not taken a drop, but every one else there is literally burning alcohol, as the lamps are burning oil; some of the men who are sound asleep in their chairs or on the floor are reeking of it so that you cannot go near them.
<p/>Now and then Jurgis gazes at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hungrily--he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) has long since forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) shyness; but then the crowd is there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) still waits and watches the door, where a carriage is supposed to come.
<p/>It does not, and finally he (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) will wait no longer, but comes up to Ona, who turns white and trembles. He (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) puts her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) shawl about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and then his (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) own coat.
<p/>There is almost no farewell--the dancers do not notice them, and all of the children and many of the old folks have fallen asleep of sheer exhaustion.
<p/>They live only two blocks away, and Jurgis does not care about the carriage. Dede Antanas is asleep, and so are the Szedvilases, husband and wife, the former snoring in octaves.
<p/>There is Teta Elzbieta, and Marija, sobbing loudly; and then there is only the silent night, with the stars beginning to pale a little in the east.
<p/>Jurgis, without a word, lifts Ona in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) arms, and strides out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) sinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) shoulder with a moan.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) reaches home he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) is not sure whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) has fainted or is asleep, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) has to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) with one hand while he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) unlocks the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) sees that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) has opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>You shall not go to Brown's today, little one,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) whispers, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) climbs the stairs; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) catches his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) arm in terror, gasping:
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``No! No! I dare not! It will ruin us!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) answers her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) again: <div class="bookquote">``Leave it to me; leave it to me.
<p/>They told him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) stories about the breaking down of men, there in the stockyards of Chicago, and of what had happened to them afterward--stories to make your flesh creep, but Jurgis would only laugh.
<p/>I will earn more money--I will work harder. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Chapter 2 Jurgis talked lightly about work, because he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) was young. He (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) had only been there four months, and he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) was young, and a giant besides.
<p/>There was too much health in him (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) could not even imagine how it would feel to be beaten. '' That is well enough for men like you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">``silpnas, puny fellows--but my back is broad.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>creep</b></font>) was the sort of man the bosses like to get hold of, the sort they make it a grievance they cannot get hold of.
<p/>Jurgis was like a boy, a boy from the country. When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was told to go to a certain place, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would go there on the run.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had nothing to do for the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would stand round fidgeting, dancing, with the overflow of energy that was in him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were working in a line of men, the line always moved too slowly for him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and you could pick him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) impatience and restlessness.
<p/>That was why he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had been picked out on one important occasion; for Jurgis had stood outside of Brown and Company's <div class="bookquote">``Central Time Station''  (<font color='red'><b>Brown</b></font>)</div>not more than half an hour, the second day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) arrival in Chicago, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had been beckoned by one of the bosses.
<p/>In vain would they all tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) that there were men in that crowd from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had been chosen who had stood there a month--yes, many months--and not been chosen yet.
<p/>Of this he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was very proud, and it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) more disposed than ever to laugh at the pessimists. '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) would say,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but what sort of men? Broken-down tramps and good-for-nothings, fellows who have spent all their money drinking, and want to get more for it.
<p/>Do you want me to believe that with these arms'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) would clench his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) fists and hold them up in the air, so that you might see the rolling muscles--``that
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is plain,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>they would answer to this, <div class="bookquote">``that you have come from the country, and from very far in the country.
<p/>And this was the fact, for Jurgis had never seen a city, and scarcely even a fair-sized town, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had set out to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) fortune in the world and earn his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) right to Ona.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) father, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) father's father before him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>), and as many ancestors back as legend could go, had lived in that part of Lithuania known as Brelovicz, the Imperial Forest.
<p/>This is a great tract of a hundred thousand acres, which from time immemorial has been a hunting preserve of the nobility.
<p/>There are a very few peasants settled in it, holding title from ancient times; and one of these was Antanas Rudkus, who had been reared himself, and had reared his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) children in turn, upon half a dozen acres of cleared land in the midst of a wilderness.
<p/>The former had been drafted into the army; that had been over ten years ago, but since that day nothing had ever been heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>).
<p/>The sister was married, and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband had bought the place when old Antanas had decided to go with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) son.
<p/>It was nearly a year and a half ago that Jurgis had met Ona, at a horse fair a hundred miles from home.
<p/>Jurgis had never expected to get married--he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had laughed at it as a foolish trap for a man to walk into; but here, without ever having spoken a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), with no more than the exchange of half a dozen smiles, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) found himself, purple in the face with embarrassment and terror, asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) parents to sell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) wife--and offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) father's two horses he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had been sent to the fair to sell.
<p/>But Ona's father proved as a rock--the girl was yet a child, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a rich man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter was not to be had in that way.
<p/>with these arms people will ever let me starve?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' There had been one son besides Jurgis, and one sister. So Jurgis went home with a heavy heart, and that spring and summer toiled and tried hard to forget.
<p/>In the fall, after the harvest was over, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) saw that it would not do, and tramped the full fortnight's journey that lay between him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and Ona.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) found an unexpected state of affairs--for the girl's father had died, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) estate was tied up with creditors; Jurgis' heart leaped as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) realized that now the prize was within his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) reach.
<p/>There was Elzbieta Lukoszaite, Teta, or Aunt, as they called her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>), Ona's stepmother, and there were her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) six children, of all ages.
<p/>They were people of great consequence, as it seemed to Jurgis, fresh out of the woods; Ona knew how to read, and knew many other things that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not know, and now the farm had been sold, and the whole family was adrift--all they owned in the world being about seven hundred rubles which is half as many dollars.
<p/>They would have had three times that, but it had gone to court, and the judge had decided against them, and it had cost the balance to get him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) to change his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) decision.
<p/>There was also her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) brother Jonas, a dried-up little man who had worked upon the farm. Ona might have married and left them, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would not, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) loved Teta Elzbieta.
<p/>It was Jonas who suggested that they all go to America, where a friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had gotten rich. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would work, for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) part, and the women would work, and some of the children, doubtless--they would live somehow.
<p/>That was a country where, they said, a man might earn three rubles a day; and Jurgis figured what three rubles a day would mean, with prices as they were where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived, and decided forthwith that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go to America and marry, and be a rich man in the bargain.
<p/>In that country, rich or poor, a man was free, it was said; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not have to go into the army, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not have to pay out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money to rascally officials--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleased, and count himself as good as any other man.
<p/>Jurgis, too, had heard of America. So America was a place of which lovers and young people dreamed. If one could only manage to get the price of a passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could count his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) troubles at an end.
<p/>It was arranged that they should leave the following spring, and meantime Jurgis sold himself to a contractor for a certain time, and tramped nearly four hundred miles from home with a gang of men to work upon a railroad in Smolensk.
<p/>This was a fearful experience, with filth and bad food and cruelty and overwork; but Jurgis stood it and came out in fine trim, and with eighty rubles sewed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) coat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) did not drink or fight, because he (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) was thinking all the time of Ona; and for the rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>contractor</b></font>) was a quiet, steady man, who did what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was told to, did not lose his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temper often, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did lose it made the offender anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should not lose it again.
<p/>When they paid him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dodged the company gamblers and dramshops, and so they tried to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) escaped, and tramped it home, working at odd jobs, and sleeping always with one eye open.
<p/>So in the summer time they had all set out for America. At the last moment there joined them Marija Berczynskas, who was a cousin of Ona's.
<p/>It was only at the age of twenty that it had occurred to Marija to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) strength, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had risen up and nearly murdered the man, and then come away.
<p/>Marija was an orphan, and had worked since childhood for a rich farmer of Vilna, who beat her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) regularly. There were twelve in all in the party, five adults and six children--and Ona, who was a little of both.
<p/>They had a hard time on the passage; there was an agent who helped them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) proved a scoundrel, and got them into a trap with some officials, and cost them a good deal of their precious money, which they clung to with such horrible fear.
<p/>This happened to them again in New York--for, of course, they knew nothing about the country, and had no one to tell them, and it was easy for a man in a blue uniform to lead them away, and to take them to a hotel and keep them there, and make them pay enormous charges to get away.
<p/>The law says that the rate card shall be on the door of a hotel, but it does not say that it shall be in Lithuanian.
<p/>They knew that one word, Chicago and that was all they needed to know, at least, until they reached the city.
<p/>Then, tumbled out of the cars without ceremony, they were no better off than before; they stood staring down the vista of Dearborn Street, with its big black buildings towering in the distance, unable to realize that they had arrived, and why, when they said <div class="bookquote">``Chicago,''  (<font color='red'><b>Chicago people</b></font>)</div>people no longer pointed in some direction, but instead looked perplexed, or laughed, or went on without paying any attention.
<p/>They were pitiable in their helplessness; above all things they stood in deadly terror of any sort of person in official uniform, and so whenever they saw a policeman they would cross the street and hurry by.
<p/>For the whole of the first day they wandered about in the midst of deafening confusion, utterly lost; and it was only at night that, cowering in the doorway of a house, they were finally discovered and taken by a policeman to the station.
<p/>In the morning an interpreter was found, and they were taken and put upon a car, and taught a new word--<div class="bookquote">``stockyards.
<p/>Their delight at discovering that they were to get out of this adventure without losing another share of their possessions it would not be possible to describe.
<p/>It was in the stockyards that Jonas' friend had gotten rich, and so to Chicago the party was bound. ''  (<font color='red'><b>an interpreter</b></font>)</div>They sat and stared out of the window.
<p/>They were on a street which seemed to run on forever, mile after mile--thirty-four of them, if they had known it--and each side of it one uninterrupted row of wretched little two-story frame buildings.
<p/>Down every side street they could see, it was the same--never a hill and never a hollow, but always the same endless vista of ugly and dirty little wooden buildings.
<p/>Here and there would be a bridge crossing a filthy creek, with hard-baked mud shores and dingy sheds and docks along it; here and there would be a railroad crossing, with a tangle of switches, and locomotives puffing, and rattling freight cars filing by; here and there would be a great factory, a dingy building with innumerable windows in it, and immense volumes of smoke pouring from the chimneys, darkening the air above and making filthy the earth beneath.
<p/>But after each of these interruptions, the desolate procession would begin again--the procession of dreary little buildings. A full hour before the party reached the city they had begun to note the perplexing changes in the atmosphere.
<p/>Every minute, as the train sped on, the colors of things became dingier; the fields were grown parched and yellow, the landscape hideous and bare.
<p/>It grew darker all the time, and upon the earth the grass seemed to grow less green. And along with the thickening smoke they began to notice another circumstance, a strange, pungent odor.
<p/>They were not sure that it was unpleasant, this odor; some might have called it sickening, but their taste in odors was not developed, and they were only sure that it was curious.
<p/>Now, sitting in the trolley car, they realized that they were on their way to the home of it--that they had traveled all the way from Lithuania to it.
<p/>It was now no longer something far off and faint, that you caught in whiffs; you could literally taste it, as well as smell it--you could take hold of it, almost, and examine it at your leisure.
<p/>They were divided in their opinions about it. It was an elemental odor, raw and crude; it was rich, almost rancid, sensual, and strong.
<p/>There were some who drank it in as if it were an intoxicant; there were others who put their handkerchiefs to their faces.
<p/>The new emigrants were still tasting it, lost in wonder, when suddenly the car came to a halt, and the door was flung open, and a voice shouted--<div class="bookquote">``Stockyards!
<p/>They were left standing upon the corner, staring; down a side street there were two rows of brick houses, and between them a vista: half a dozen chimneys, tall as the tallest of buildings, touching the very sky--and leaping from them half a dozen columns of smoke, thick, oily, and black as night.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The emigrants</b></font>)</div>It might have come from the center of the world, this smoke, where the fires of the ages still smolder.
<p/>It came as if self-impelled, driving all before it, a perpetual explosion. It was inexhaustible; one stared, waiting to see it stop, but still the great streams rolled out.
<p/>They spread in vast clouds overhead, writhing, curling; then, uniting in one giant river, they streamed away down the sky, stretching a black pall as far as the eye could reach.
<p/>This, too, like the color, was a thing elemental; it was a sound, a sound made up of ten thousand little sounds.
<p/>Then the party became aware of another strange thing. You scarcely noticed it at first--it sunk into your consciousness, a vague disturbance, a trouble.
<p/>It was like the murmuring of the bees in the spring, the whisperings of the forest; it suggested endless activity, the rumblings of a world in motion.
<p/>It was only by an effort that one could realize that it was made by animals, that it was the distant lowing of ten thousand cattle, the distant grunting of ten thousand swine.
<p/>They would have liked to follow it up, but, alas, they had no time for adventures just then. The policeman on the corner was beginning to watch them; and so, as usual, they started up the street.
<p/>Scarcely had they gone a block, however, before Jonas was heard to give a cry, and began pointing excitedly across the street.
<p/>Before they could gather the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) breathless ejaculations he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) had bounded away, and they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) enter a shop, over which was a sign: ``J. Szedvilas, Delicatessen.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>J.</b></font>) came out again it was in company with a very stout gentleman in shirt sleeves and an apron, clasping Jonas by both hands and laughing hilariously.
<p/>Then Teta Elzbieta recollected suddenly that Szedvilas had been the name of the mythical friend who had made his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fortune in America.
<p/>To find that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been making it in the delicatessen business was an extraordinary piece of good fortune at this juncture; though it was well on in the morning, they had not breakfasted, and the children were beginning to whimper.
<p/>The two families literally fell upon each other's necks--for it had been years since Jokubas Szedvilas had met a man from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part of Lithuania.
<p/>Jokubas understood all the pitfalls of this new world, and could explain all of its mysteries; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could tell them the things they ought to have done in the different emergencies--and what was still more to the point, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could tell them what to do now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would take them to poni Aniele, who kept a boardinghouse the other side of the yards; old Mrs. Jukniene, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) explained, had not what one would call choice accommodations, but they might do for the moment.
<p/>To this Teta Elzbieta hastened to respond that nothing could be too cheap to suit them just then; for they were quite terrified over the sums they had had to expend.
<p/>A very few days of practical experience in this land of high wages had been sufficient to make clear to them the cruel fact that it was also a land of high prices, and that in it the poor man was almost as poor as in any other corner of the earth; and so there vanished in a night all the wonderful dreams of wealth that had been haunting Jurgis.
<p/>What had made the discovery all the more painful was that they were spending, at American prices, money which they had earned at home rates of wages--and so were really being cheated by the world!
<p/>The last two days they had all but starved themselves--it made them quite sick to pay the prices that the railroad people asked them for food.
<p/>Yet, when they saw the home of the Widow Jukniene they could not but recoil, even so, in all their journey they had seen nothing so bad as this.
<p/>Poni Aniele had a four-room flat in one of that wilderness of two-story frame tenements that lie ``back of the yards.
<p/>There were four such flats in each building, and each of the four was a <div class="bookquote">``boardinghouse''  (<font color='red'><b>foreigners</b></font>)</div>for the occupancy of foreigners--Lithuanians, Poles, Slovaks, or Bohemians.
<p/>'' Thus was the happy ending to a woeful voyage. Before half the day they were lifelong friends. '' Some of these places were kept by private persons, some were cooperative.
<p/>There would be an average of half a dozen boarders to each room--sometimes there were thirteen or fourteen to one room, fifty or sixty to a flat.
<p/>The mattresses would be spread upon the floor in rows--and there would be nothing else in the place except a stove.
<p/>It was by no means unusual for two men to own the same mattress in common, one working by day and using it by night, and the other working at night and using it in the daytime.
<p/>Each one of the occupants furnished his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) own accommodations--that is, a mattress and some bedding. Very frequently a lodging house keeper would rent the same beds to double shifts of men.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) home was unthinkably filthy; you could not enter by the front door at all, owing to the mattresses, and when you tried to go up the backstairs you found that she (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had walled up most of the porch with old boards to make a place to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) chickens.
<p/>Mrs. Jukniene was a wizened-up little woman, with a wrinkled face. It was a standing jest of the boarders that Aniele cleaned house by letting the chickens loose in the rooms.
<p/>Undoubtedly this did keep down the vermin, but it seemed probable, in view of all the circumstances, that the old lady regarded it rather as feeding the chickens than as cleaning the rooms.
<p/>The truth was that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had definitely given up the idea of cleaning anything, under pressure of an attack of rheumatism, which had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doubled up in one corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) room for over a week; during which time eleven of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) boarders, heavily in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) debt, had concluded to try their chances of employment in Kansas City.
<p/>One never saw the fields, nor any green thing whatever, in Packingtown; but one could go out on the road and <div class="bookquote">``hobo it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>as the men phrased it, and see the country, and have a long rest, and an easy time riding on the freight cars.
<p/>There was nothing better to be had--they might not do so well by looking further, for Mrs. Jukniene had at least kept one room for herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jukniene</b></font>) three little children, and now offered to share this with the women and the girls of the party.
<p/>They could get bedding at a secondhand store, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jukniene</b></font>) explained; and they would not need any, while the weather was so hot--doubtless they would all sleep on the sidewalk such nights as this, as did nearly all of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jukniene</b></font>) guests.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis said, when they were left alone, <div class="bookquote">``tomorrow I will get a job, and perhaps Jonas will get one also; and then we can get a place of our own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/>Later that afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) and Ona went out to take a walk and look about them, to see more of this district which was to be their home.
<p/>In back of the yards the dreary two-story frame houses were scattered farther apart, and there were great spaces bare--that seemingly had been overlooked by the great sore of a city as it spread itself over the surface of the prairie.
<p/>These bare places were grown up with dingy, yellow weeds, hiding innumerable tomato cans; innumerable children played upon them, chasing one another here and there, screaming and fighting.
<p/>The most uncanny thing about this neighborhood was the number of the children; you thought there must be a school just out, and it was only after long acquaintance that you were able to realize that there was no school, but that these were the children of the neighborhood--that there were so many children to the block in Packingtown that nowhere on its streets could a horse and buggy move faster than a walk!
<p/>This was July, and the fields were green. Such was the home to which the new arrivals were welcomed. It could not move faster anyhow, on account of the state of the streets.
<p/>The roadway was commonly several feet lower than the level of the houses, which were sometimes joined by high board walks; there were no pavements--there were mountains and valleys and rivers, gullies and ditches, and great hollows full of stinking green water.
<p/>In these pools the children played, and rolled about in the mud of the streets; here and there one noticed them digging in it, after trophies which they had stumbled on.
<p/>One wondered about this, as also about the swarms of flies which hung about the scene, literally blackening the air, and the strange, fetid odor which assailed one's nostrils, a ghastly odor, of all the dead things of the universe.
<p/>It impelled the visitor to questions and then the residents would explain, quietly, that all this was <div class="bookquote">``made''  (<font color='red'><b>the residents</b></font>)</div>land, and that it had been <div class="bookquote">``made''  (<font color='red'><b>the residents</b></font>)</div>by using it as a dumping ground for the city garbage.
<p/>After a few years the unpleasant effect of this would pass away, it was said; but meantime, in hot weather--and especially when it rained--the flies were apt to be annoying.
<p/>Those through which Jurgis and Ona were walking resembled streets less than they did a miniature topographical map. Was it not unhealthful?
<p/>A little way farther on, and Jurgis and Ona, staring open-eyed and wondering, came to the place where this <div class="bookquote">``made''  (<font color='red'><b>Ona/Little Ona</b></font>)</div>ground was in process of making.
<p/>the stranger would ask, and the residents would answer, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps; but there is no telling. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the residents</b></font>)</div>Here was a great hole, perhaps two city blocks square, and with long files of garbage wagons creeping into it.
<p/>The place had an odor for which there are no polite words; and it was sprinkled over with children, who raked in it from dawn till dark.
<p/>Sometimes visitors from the packing houses would wander out to see this <div class="bookquote">``dump,''  (<font color='red'><b>visitors</b></font>)</div>and they would stand by and debate as to whether the children were eating the food they got, or merely collecting it for the chickens at home.
<p/>Apparently none of them ever went down to find out. Beyond this dump there stood a great brickyard, with smoking chimneys.
<p/>First they took out the soil to make bricks, and then they filled it up again with garbage, which seemed to Jurgis and Ona a felicitous arrangement, characteristic of an enterprising country like America.
<p/>This held water, and all summer it stood there, with the near-by soil draining into it, festering and stewing in the sun; and then, when winter came, somebody cut the ice on it, and sold it to the people of the city.
<p/>This, too, seemed to the newcomers an economical arrangement; for they did not read the newspapers, and their heads were not full of troublesome thoughts about <div class="bookquote">``germs.
<p/>They stood there while the sun went down upon this scene, and the sky in the west turned blood-red, and the tops of the houses shone like fire.
<p/>Jurgis and Ona were not thinking of the sunset, however--their backs were turned to it, and all their thoughts were of Packingtown, which they could see so plainly in the distance.
<p/>The line of the buildings stood clear-cut and black against the sky; here and there out of the mass rose the great chimneys, with the river of smoke streaming away to the end of the world.
<p/>It was a study in colors now, this smoke; in the sunset light it was black and brown and gray and purple.
<p/>A little way beyond was another great hole, which they had emptied and not yet filled up. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the newcomers arrangement</b></font>)</div>All the sordid suggestions of the place were gone--in the twilight it was a vision of power.
<p/>To the two who stood watching while the darkness swallowed it up, it seemed a dream of wonder, with its talc of human energy, of things being done, of employment for thousands upon thousands of men, of opportunity and freedom, of life and love and joy.
<p/>When they came away, arm in arm, Jurgis was saying, <div class="bookquote">``Tomorrow I shall go there and get a job!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Chapter 3
<p/>Among these was one of the special policemen employed by Durham, whose duty it frequently was to pick out men for employment.
<p/>Jokubas had never tried it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) expressed a certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) could get some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) friends a job through this man.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) capacity as delicatessen vender, Jokubas Szedvilas had many acquaintances. It was agreed, after consultation, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) should make the effort with old Antanas and with Jonas.
<p/>Jurgis was confident of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) ability to get work for himself, unassisted by any one. As we have said before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) was not mistaken in this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) had gone to Brown's and stood there not more than half an hour before one of the bosses noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) form towering above the rest, and signaled to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>).
<p/>The colloquy which followed was brief and to the point: <div class="bookquote">``Speak English?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No; Lit-uanian. '' -LRB-Jurgis had studied this word carefully.-RRB-
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Job?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Je. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-A nod.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Worked here before?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No `stand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boss</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Signals and gesticulations on the part of the boss. Vigorous shakes of the head by Jurgis.-RRB-
<p/>'' Shovel guts?'' <div class="bookquote">``No `stand. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-More shakes of the head.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``Zarnos. Pagaiksztis. Szluofa! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Imitative motions.-RRB- '' Je.'' <div class="bookquote">``See door.
<p/>Durys? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Pointing.-RRB- '' Je.'' <div class="bookquote">``To-morrow, seven o'clock. Understand? Rytoj! Prieszpietys! Septyni!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Dekui, tamistai! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Thank you, sir.-RRB- And that was all.
<p/>Jurgis turned away, and then in a sudden rush the full realization of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) triumph swept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) gave a yell and a jump, and started off on a run.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) went all the way home as if upon wings, and burst into the house like a cyclone, to the rage of the numerous lodgers who had just turned in for their daily sleep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had a job! He (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had a job! Meantime Jokubas had been to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) friend the policeman, and received encouragement, so it was a happy party.
<p/>There being no more to be done that day, the shop was left under the care of Lucija, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) husband sallied forth to show his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) friends the sights of Packingtown.
<p/>Jokubas did this with the air of a country gentleman escorting a party of visitors over his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) estate; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was an old-time resident, and all these wonders had grown up under his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a personal pride in them.
<p/>The packers might own the land, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) claimed the landscape, and there was no one to say nay to this.
<p/>They passed down the busy street that led to the yards. It was still early morning, and everything was at its high tide of activity.
<p/>A steady stream of employees was pouring through the gate--employees of the higher sort, at this hour, clerks and stenographers and such.
<p/>For the women there were waiting big two-horse wagons, which set off at a gallop as fast as they were filled.
<p/>They followed it, this time, as eager as children in sight of a circus menagerie--which, indeed, the scene a good deal resembled.
<p/>In the distance there was heard again the lowing of the cattle, a sound as of a far-off ocean calling. They crossed the railroad tracks, and then on each side of the street were the pens full of cattle
<p/>; they would have stopped to look, but Jokubas hurried them on, to where there was a stairway and a raised gallery, from which everything could be seen.
<p/>There is over a square mile of space in the yards, and more than half of it is occupied by cattle pens; north and south as far as the eye can reach there stretches a sea of pens.
<p/>Here they stood, staring, breathless with wonder. And they were all filled--so many cattle no one had ever dreamed existed in the world.
<p/>Red cattle, black, white, and yellow cattle; old cattle and young cattle; great bellowing bulls and little calves not an hour born; meek-eyed milch cows and fierce, long-horned Texas steers.
<p/>The sound of them here was as of all the barnyards of the universe; and as for counting them--it would have taken all day simply to count the pens.
<p/>Here and there ran long alleys, blocked at intervals by gates; and Jokubas told them that the number of these gates was twenty-five thousand.
<p/>Jokubas had recently been reading a newspaper article which was full of statistics such as that, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was very proud as he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) repeated them and made his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) guests cry out with wonder.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) not just gotten a job, and become a sharer in all this activity, a cog in this marvelous machine?
<p/>Here and there about the alleys galloped men upon horseback, booted, and carrying long whips; they were very busy, calling to each other, and to those who were driving the cattle.
<p/>They were drovers and stock raisers, who had come from far states, and brokers and commission merchants, and buyers for all the big packing houses.
<p/>Here and there they would stop to inspect a bunch of cattle, and there would be a parley, brief and businesslike.
<p/>The buyer would nod or drop his (<font color='blue'><b>drovers</b></font>) whip, and that would mean a bargain; and he (<font color='blue'><b>drovers</b></font>) would note it in his (<font color='blue'><b>drovers</b></font>) little book, along with hundreds of others he (<font color='blue'><b>drovers</b></font>) had made that morning.
<p/>Then Jokubas pointed out the place where the cattle were driven to be weighed, upon a great scale that would weigh a hundred thousand pounds at once and record it automatically.
<p/>It was near to the east entrance that they stood, and all along this east side of the yards ran the railroad tracks, into which the cars were run, loaded with cattle.
<p/>All night long this had been going on, and now the pens were full; by tonight they would all be empty, and the same thing would be done again.
<p/>Jurgis too had a little of this sense of pride. '' And what will become of all these creatures?'' cried Teta Elzbieta.
<p/>By tonight,'' Jokubas answered, <div class="bookquote">``they will all be killed and cut up; and over there on the other side of the packing houses are more railroad tracks, where the cars come to take them away.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Szedvilas/Jokubas/Jokubas Szedvilas</b></font>)</div>'' There were two hundred and fifty miles of track within the yards, their guide went on to tell them.
<p/>They brought about ten thousand head of cattle every day, and as many hogs, and half as many sheep--which meant some eight or ten million live creatures turned into food every year.
<p/>One stood and watched, and little by little caught the drift of the tide, as it set in the direction of the packing houses.
<p/>There were groups of cattle being driven to the chutes, which were roadways about fifteen feet wide, raised high above the pens.
<p/>In these chutes the stream of animals was continuous; it was quite uncanny to watch them, pressing on to their fate, all unsuspicious a very river of death.
<p/>Our friends were not poetical, and the sight suggested to them no metaphors of human destiny; they thought only of the wonderful efficiency of it all.
<p/>The chutes into which the hogs went climbed high up--to the very top of the distant buildings; and Jokubas explained that the hogs went up by the power of their own legs, and then their weight carried them back through all the processes necessary to make them into pork.
<p/>They don't waste anything here,'' said the guide, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) laughed and added a witticism, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) was pleased that his (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) unsophisticated friends should take to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Our</b></font>) own:
<p/>In front of Brown's General Office building there grows a tiny plot of grass, and this, you may learn, is the only bit of green thing in Packingtown; likewise this jest about the hog and his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) squeal, the stock in trade of all the guides, is the one gleam of humor that you will find there.
<p/>After they had seen enough of the pens, the party went up the street, to the mass of buildings which occupy the center of the yards.
<p/>These buildings, made of brick and stained with innumerable layers of Packingtown smoke, were painted all over with advertising signs, from which the visitor realized suddenly that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had come to the home of many of the torments of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) life.
<p/>It was here that they made those products with the wonders of which they pestered him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) so--by placards that defaced the landscape when he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) traveled, and by staring advertisements in the newspapers and magazines--by silly little jingles that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) could not get out of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) mind, and gaudy pictures that lurked for him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) around every street corner.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``They use everything about the hog except the squeal. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Brown</b></font>)</div>Here was where they made Brown's Imperial Hams and Bacon, Brown's Dressed Beef, Brown's Excelsior Sausages!
<p/>Here was the headquarters of Durham's Pure Leaf Lard, of Durham's Breakfast Bacon, Durham's Canned Beef, Potted Ham, Deviled Chicken, Peerless Fertilizer!
<p/>Entering one of the Durham buildings, they found a number of other visitors waiting; and before long there came a guide, to escort them through the place.
<p/>They make a great feature of showing strangers through the packing plants, for it is a good advertisement. But Ponas Jokubas whispered maliciously that the visitors did not see any more than the packers wanted them to.
<p/>Here was the chute, with its river of hogs, all patiently toiling upward; there was a place for them to rest to cool off, and then through another passageway they went into a room from which there is no returning for hogs.
<p/>They climbed a long series of stairways outside of the building, to the top of its five or six stories. It was a long, narrow room, with a gallery along it for visitors.
<p/>At the head there was a great iron wheel, about twenty feet in circumference, with rings here and there along its edge.
<p/>Upon both sides of this wheel there was a narrow space, into which came the hogs at the end of their journey; in the midst of them stood a great burly Negro, bare-armed and bare-chested.
<p/>In a minute or two, however, it began slowly to revolve, and then the men upon each side of it sprang to work.
<p/>They had chains which they fastened about the leg of the nearest hog, and the other end of the chain they hooked into one of the rings upon the wheel.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) was resting for the moment, for the wheel had stopped while men were cleaning up. So, as the wheel turned, a hog was suddenly jerked off his (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) feet and borne aloft.
<p/>At the same instant the car was assailed by a most terrifying shriek; the visitors started in alarm, the women turned pale and shrank back.
<p/>The shriek was followed by another, louder and yet more agonizing--for once started upon that journey, the hog never came back; at the top of the wheel he (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) was shunted off upon a trolley, and went sailing down the room.
<p/>And meantime another was swung up, and then another, and another, until there was a double line of them, each dangling by a foot and kicking in frenzy--and squealing.
<p/>The uproar was appalling, perilous to the eardrums; one feared there was too much sound for the room to hold--that the walls must give way or the ceiling crack.
<p/>There were high squeals and low squeals, grunts, and wails of agony; there would come a momentary lull, and then a fresh outburst, louder than ever, surging up to a deafening climax.
<p/>It was too much for some of the visitors--the men would look at each other, laughing nervously, and the women would stand with hands clenched, and the blood rushing to their faces, and the tears starting in their eyes.
<p/>Neither squeals of hogs nor tears of visitors made any difference to them; one by one they hooked up the hogs, and one by one with a swift stroke they slit their throats.
<p/>There was a long line of hogs, with squeals and lifeblood ebbing away together; until at last each started again, and vanished with a splash into a huge vat of boiling water.
<p/>Meantime, heedless of all these things, the men upon the floor were going about their work. It was all so very businesslike that one watched it fascinated.
<p/>And yet somehow the most matter-of-fact person could not help thinking of the hogs; they were so innocent, they came so very trustingly; and they were so very human in their protests--and so perfectly within their rights!
<p/>They had done nothing to deserve it; and it was adding insult to injury, as the thing was done here, swinging them up in this cold-blooded, impersonal way, without a pretense of apology, without the homage of a tear.
<p/>It was porkmaking by machinery, porkmaking by applied mathematics. Now and then a visitor wept, to be sure; but this slaughtering machine ran on, visitors or no visitors.
<p/>It was like some horrible crime committed in a dungeon, all unseen and unheeded, buried out of sight and of memory.
<p/>One could not stand and watch very long without becoming philosophical, without beginning to deal in symbols and similes, and to hear the hog squeal of the universe.
<p/>Was it permitted to believe that there was nowhere upon the earth, or above the earth, a heaven for hogs, where they were requited for all this suffering?
<p/>Some were white hogs, some were black; some were brown, some were spotted; some were old, some young; some were long and lean, some were monstrous.
<p/>And each of them had an individuality of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own, a will of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) own, a hope and a heart's desire; each was full of self-confidence, of self-importance, and a sense of dignity.
<p/>And trusting and strong in faith he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had gone about his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) business, the while a black shadow hung over him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) and a horrid Fate waited in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) pathway.
<p/>Each one of these hogs was a separate creature. Now suddenly it had swooped upon him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and had seized him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) by the leg.
<p/>Relentless, remorseless, it was; all his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) protests, his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) screams, were nothing to it--it did its cruel will with him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), as if his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wishes, his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) feelings, had simply no existence at all; it cut his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) throat and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) gasp out his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) life.
<p/>And now was one to believe that there was nowhere a god of hogs, to whom this hog personality was precious, to whom these hog squeals and agonies had a meaning?
<p/>Who would take this hog into his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) arms and comfort him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>), reward him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) work well done, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) sacrifice?
<p/>Perhaps some glimpse of all this was in the thoughts of our humble-minded Jurgis, as he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) turned to go on with the rest of the party, and muttered: <div class="bookquote">``Dieve--but I'm glad I'm not a hog!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div><p/>The carcass hog was scooped out of the vat by machinery, and then it fell to the second floor, passing on the way through a wonderful machine with numerous scrapers, which adjusted themselves to the size and shape of the animal, and sent it out at the other end with nearly all of its bristles removed.
<p/>It was then again strung up by machinery, and sent upon another trolley ride; this time passing between two lines of men, who sat upon a raised platform, each doing a certain single thing to the carcass as it came to him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>).
<p/>One with a swift stroke cut the throat; another with two swift strokes severed the head, which fell to the floor and vanished through a hole.
<p/>Another made a slit down the body; a second opened the body wider; a third with a saw cut the breastbone; a fourth loosened the entrails; a fifth pulled them out--and they also slid through a hole in the floor.
<p/>There were men to scrape each side and men to scrape the back; there were men to clean the carcass inside, to trim it and wash it.
<p/>Looking down this room, one saw, creeping slowly, a line of dangling hogs a hundred yards in length; and for every yard there was a man, working as if a demon were after him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>).
<p/>At the end of this hog's progress every inch of the carcass had been gone over several times; and then it was rolled into the chilling room, where it stayed for twenty-four hours, and where a stranger might lose himself in a forest of freezing hogs.
<p/>Before the carcass was admitted here, however, it had to pass a government inspector, who sat in the doorway and felt of the glands in the neck for tuberculosis.
<p/>This government inspector did not have the manner of a man who was worked to death; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was apparently not haunted by a fear that the hog might get by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) testing.
<p/>If you were a sociable person, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite willing to enter into conversation with you, and to explain to you the deadly nature of the ptomaines which are found in tubercular pork; and while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking with you you could hardly be so ungrateful as to notice that a dozen carcasses were passing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) untouched.
<p/>This inspector wore a blue uniform, with brass buttons, and he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) gave an atmosphere of authority to the scene, and, as it were, put the stamp of official approval upon the things which were done in Durham's.
<p/>One scraped the outside of a leg; another scraped the inside of the same leg. Jurgis went down the line with the rest of the visitors, staring open-mouthed, lost in wonder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) had dressed hogs himself in the forest of Lithuania; but he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) had never expected to live to see one hog dressed by several hundred men.
<p/>It was like a wonderful poem to him (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) took it all in guilelessly--even to the conspicuous signs demanding immaculate cleanliness of the employees.
<p/>Jurgis was vexed when the cynical Jokubas translated these signs with sarcastic comments, offering to take them to the secret rooms where the spoiled meats went to be doctored.
<p/>Here came the entrails, to be scraped and washed clean for sausage casings; men and women worked here in the midst of a sickening stench, which caused the visitors to hasten by, gasping.
<p/>To another room came all the scraps to be <div class="bookquote">``tanked,''  (<font color='red'><b>the visitors</b></font>)</div>which meant boiling and pumping off the grease to make soap and lard; below they took out the refuse, and this, too, was a region in which the visitors did not linger.
<p/>The party descended to the next floor, where the various waste materials were treated. In still other places men were engaged in cutting up the carcasses that had been through the chilling rooms.
<p/>First there were the <div class="bookquote">``splitters,''  (<font color='red'><b>the workmen thing day</b></font>)</div>the most expert workmen in the plant, who earned as high as fifty cents an hour, and did not a thing all day except chop hogs down the middle.
<p/>Then there were <div class="bookquote">``cleaver men,''  (<font color='red'><b>giants</b></font>)</div>great giants with muscles of iron; each had two men to attend him (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>)--to slide the half carcass in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) on the table, and hold it while he (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) chopped it, and then turn each piece so that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) might chop it once more.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) cleaver had a blade about two feet long, and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) never made but one cut; he (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) made it so neatly, too, that his (<font color='blue'><b>visitors</b></font>) implement did not smite through and dull itself--there was just enough force for a perfect cut, and no more.
<p/>So through various yawning holes there slipped to the floor below--to one room hams, to another forequarters, to another sides of pork.
<p/>One might go down to this floor and see the pickling rooms, where the hams were put into vats, and the great smoke rooms, with their airtight iron doors.
<p/>In other rooms they prepared salt pork--there were whole cellars full of it, built up in great towers to the ceiling.
<p/>In yet other rooms they were putting up meats in boxes and barrels, and wrapping hams and bacon in oiled paper, sealing and labeling and sewing them.
<p/>From the doors of these rooms went men with loaded trucks, to the platform where freight cars were waiting to be filled; and one went out there and realized with a start that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had come at last to the ground floor of this enormous building.
<p/>Then the party went across the street to where they did the killing of beef--where every hour they turned four or five hundred cattle into meat.
<p/>Unlike the place they had left, all this work was done on one floor; and instead of there being one line of carcasses which moved to the workmen, there were fifteen or twenty lines, and the men moved from one to another of these.
<p/>This made a scene of intense activity, a picture of human power wonderful to watch. It was all in one great room, like a circus amphitheater, with a gallery for visitors running over the center.
<p/>Along one side of the room ran a narrow gallery, a few feet from the floor; into which gallery the cattle were driven by men with goads which gave them electric shocks.
<p/>Once crowded in here, the creatures were prisoned, each in a separate pen, by gates that shut, leaving them no room to turn around; and while they stood bellowing and plunging, over the top of the pen there leaned one of the <div class="bookquote">``knockers,''  (<font color='red'><b>the creatures</b></font>)</div>armed with a sledge hammer, and watching for a chance to deal a blow.
<p/>The instant the animal had fallen, the <div class="bookquote">``knocker''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>passed on to another; while a second man raised a lever, and the side of the pen was raised, and the animal, still kicking and struggling, slid out to the <div class="bookquote">``killing bed.
<p/>Here a man put shackles about one leg, and pressed another lever, and the body was jerked up into the air.
<p/>There were fifteen or twenty such pens, and it was a matter of only a couple of minutes to knock fifteen or twenty cattle and roll them out.
<p/>Then once more the gates were opened, and another lot rushed in; and so out of each pen there rolled a steady stream of carcasses, which the men upon the killing beds had to get out of the way.
<p/>The room echoed with the thuds in quick succession, and the stamping and kicking of the steers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>The manner in which they did this was something to be seen and never forgotten.
<p/>They worked with furious intensity, literally upon the run--at a pace with which there is nothing to be compared except a football game.
<p/>It was all highly specialized labor, each man having his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) task to do; generally this would consist of only two or three specific cuts, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would pass down the line of fifteen or twenty carcasses, making these cuts upon each.
<p/>First there came the <div class="bookquote">``butcher,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>to bleed them; this meant one swift stroke, so swift that you could not see it--only the flash of the knife; and before you could realize it, the man had darted on to the next line, and a stream of bright red was pouring out upon the floor.
<p/>This floor was half an inch deep with blood, in spite of the best efforts of men who kept shoveling it through holes; it must have made the floor slippery, but no one could have guessed this by watching the men at work.
<p/>The carcass hung for a few minutes to bleed; there was no time lost, however, for there were several hanging in each line, and one was always ready.
<p/>It was let down to the ground, and there came the <div class="bookquote">``headsman,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>whose task it was to sever the head, with two or three swift strokes.
<p/>Then came the <div class="bookquote">``floorsman,''  (<font color='red'><b>a dozen</b></font>)</div>to make the first cut in the skin; and then another to finish ripping the skin down the center; and then half a dozen more in swift succession, to finish the skinning.
<p/>After they were through, the carcass was again swung up; and while a man with a stick examined the skin, to make sure that it had not been cut, and another rolled it up and tumbled it through one of the inevitable holes in the floor, the beef proceeded on its journey.
<p/>There were men to cut it, and men to split it, and men to gut it and scrape it clean inside.
<p/>There were some with hose which threw jets of boiling water upon it, and others who removed the feet and added the final touches.
<p/>In the end, as with the hogs, the finished beef was run into the chilling room, to hang its appointed time.
<p/>The visitors were taken there and shown them, all neatly hung in rows, labeled conspicuously with the tags of the government inspectors--and some, which had been killed by a special process, marked with the sign of the kosher rabbi, certifying that it was fit for sale to the orthodox.
<p/>And then the visitors were taken to the other parts of the building, to see what became of each particle of the waste material that had vanished through the floor; and to the pickling rooms, and the salting rooms, the canning rooms, and the packing rooms, where choice meat was prepared for shipping in refrigerator cars, destined to be eaten in all the four corners of civilization.
<p/>Afterward they went outside, wandering about among the mazes of buildings in which was done the work auxiliary to this great industry.
<p/>There was scarcely a thing needed in the business that Durham and Company did not make for themselves. There was a great steam power plant and an electricity plant.
<p/>There was a building to which the grease was piped, and made into soap and lard; and then there was a factory for making lard cans, and another for making soap boxes.
<p/>There was a building in which the bristles were cleaned and dried, for the making of hair cushions and such things; there was a building where the skins were dried and tanned, there was another where heads and feet were made into glue, and another where bones were made into fertilizer.
<p/>Out of the horns of the cattle they made combs, buttons, hairpins, and imitation ivory; out of the shinbones and other big bones they cut knife and toothbrush handles, and mouthpieces for pipes; out of the hoofs they cut hairpins and buttons, before they made the rest into glue.
<p/>From such things as feet, knuckles, hide clippings, and sinews came such strange and unlikely products as gelatin, isinglass, and phosphorus, bone black, shoe blacking, and bone oil.
<p/>They had curled-hair works for the cattle tails, and a <div class="bookquote">``wool pullery''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>for the sheepskins; they made pepsin from the stomachs of the pigs, and albumen from the blood, and violin strings from the ill-smelling entrails.
<p/>When there was nothing else to be done with a thing, they first put it into a tank and got out of it all the tallow and grease, and then they made it into fertilizer.
<p/>All these industries were gathered into buildings near by, connected by galleries and railroads with the main establishment; and it was estimated that they had handled nearly a quarter of a billion of animals since the founding of the plant by the elder Durham a generation and more ago.
<p/>There was a barrel factory, and a boiler-repair shop. No tiniest particle of organic matter was wasted in Durham's. If you counted with it the other big plants--and they were now really all one--it was,
<p/>It employed thirty thousand men; it supported directly two hundred and fifty thousand people in its neighborhood, and indirectly it supported half a million.
<p/>It sent its products to every country in the civilized world, and it furnished the food for no less than thirty million people!
<p/>To all of these things our friends would listen open-mouthed--it seemed to them impossible of belief that anything so stupendous could have been devised by mortal man.
<p/>so Jokubas informed them, the greatest aggregation of labor and capital ever gathered in one place. That was why to Jurgis it seemed almost profanity to speak about the place as did Jokubas, skeptically
<p/>; it was a thing as tremendous as the universe--the laws and ways of its working no more than the universe to be questioned or understood.
<p/>All that a mere man could do, it seemed to Jurgis, was to take a thing like this as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found it, and do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was told; to be given a place in it and a share in its wonderful activities was a blessing to be grateful for, as one was grateful for the sunshine and the rain.
<p/>Jurgis was even glad that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not seen the place before meeting with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) triumph, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that the size of it would have overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the feeling that this whole huge establishment had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) under its protection, and had become responsible for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) welfare.
<p/>So guileless was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and ignorant of the nature of business, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not even realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become an employee of Brown's, and that Brown and Durham were supposed by all the world to be deadly rivals--were even required to be deadly rivals by the law of the land, and ordered to try to ruin each other under penalty of fine and imprisonment!
<p/>But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had been admitted--he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was a part of it all! Chapter 4 Promptly at seven the next morning Jurgis reported for work.
<p/>The boss had meant for him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) to enter, but had not said this, and so it was only when on his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) way out to hire another man that he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) came upon Jurgis.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) came to the door that had been pointed out to him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>), and there he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) waited for nearly two hours. He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) a good cursing, but as Jurgis did not understand a word of it he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) did not object.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) followed the boss, who showed him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) where to put his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) street clothes, and waited while he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) donned the working clothes he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) had bought in a secondhand shop and brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) in a bundle; then he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) led him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) to the <div class="bookquote">``killing beds.
<p/>The work which Jurgis was to do here was very simple, and it took him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) but a few minutes to learn it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was provided with a stiff besom, such as is used by street sweepers, and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) place to follow down the line the man who drew out the smoking entrails from the carcass of the steer; this mass was to be swept into a trap, which was then closed, so that no one might slip into it.
<p/>As Jurgis came in, the first cattle of the morning were just making their appearance; and so, with scarcely time to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>), and none to speak to any one, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) fell to work.
<p/>It was a sweltering day in July, and the place ran with steaming hot blood--one waded in it on the floor.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The stench was almost overpowering, but to Jurgis it was nothing. His (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) whole soul was dancing with joy--he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was at work at last!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was paid the fabulous sum of seventeen and a half cents an hour; and as it proved a rush day and he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) worked until nearly seven o'clock in the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) went home to the family with the tidings that he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) had earned more than a dollar and a half in a single day!
<p/>At home, also, there was more good news; so much of it at once that there was quite a celebration in Aniele's hall bedroom.
<p/>Jonas had been to have an interview with the special policeman to whom Szedvilas had introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>), and had been taken to see several of the bosses, with the result that one had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) a job the beginning of the next week.
<p/>And then there was Marija Berczynskas, who, fired with jealousy by the success of Jurgis, had set out upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) own responsibility to get a place.
<p/>Marija had nothing to take with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) save her (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) two brawny arms and the word <div class="bookquote">``job,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>laboriously learned; but with these she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had marched about Packingtown all day, entering every door where there were signs of activity.
<p/>Out of some she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had been ordered with curses; but Marija was not afraid of man or devil, and asked every one she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) saw--visitors and strangers, or work-people like herself, and once or twice even high and lofty office personages, who stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) as if they thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) was crazy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was at work and earning money! All day long he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was figuring to himself. In the end, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had reaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) reward.
<p/>In one of the smaller plants she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had stumbled upon a room where scores of women and girls were sitting at long tables preparing smoked beef in cans; and wandering through room after room, Marija came at last to the place where the sealed cans were being painted and labeled, and here she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had the good fortune to encounter the ``forelady.
<p/>Marija did not understand then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) was destined to understand later, what there was attractive to a <div class="bookquote">``forelady''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>about the combination of a face full of boundless good nature and the muscles of a dray horse; but the woman had told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to come the next day and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would perhaps give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a chance to learn the trade of painting cans.
<p/>The painting of cans being skilled piecework, and paying as much as two dollars a day, Marija burst in upon the family with the yell of a Comanche Indian, and fell to capering about the room so as to frighten the baby almost into convulsions.
<p/>Better luck than all this could hardly have been hoped for; there was only one of them left to seek a place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) would not have Ona working--he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) was not that sort of a man, he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was not that sort of a woman.
<p/>It would be a strange thing if a man like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not support the family, with the help of the board of Jonas and Marija.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) would not even hear of letting the children go to work--there were schools here in America for children, Jurgis had heard, to which they could go for nothing.
<p/>That the priest would object to these schools was something of which he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) had as yet no idea, and for the present his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) mind was made up that the children of Teta Elzbieta should have as fair a chance as any other children.
<p/>The oldest of them, little Stanislovas, was but thirteen, and small for his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) age at that; and while the oldest son of Szedvilas was only twelve, and had worked for over a year at Jones's, Jurgis would have it that Stanislovas should learn to speak English, and grow up to be a skilled man.
<p/>So there was only old Dede Antanas; Jurgis would have had him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) rest too, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was forced to acknowledge that this was not possible, and,
<p/>besides, the old man would not hear it spoken of--it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whim to insist that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was as lively as any boy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come to America as full of hope as the best of them; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the chief problem that worried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son.
<p/>For every one that Jurgis spoke to assured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that it was a waste of time to seek employment for the old man in Packingtown.
<p/>Szedvilas told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the packers did not even keep the men who had grown old in their own service--to say nothing of taking on new ones.
<p/>'' Jurgis was determined that Teta Elzbieta should stay at home to keep house, and that Ona should help her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>). And not only was it the rule here, it was the rule everywhere in America, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew.
<p/>To satisfy Jurgis he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had asked the policeman, and brought back the message that the thing was not to be thought of.
<p/>They had not told this to old Anthony, who had consequently spent the two days wandering about from one part of the yards to another, and had now come home to hear about the triumph of the others, smiling bravely and saying that it would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) turn another day.
<p/>Their good luck, they felt, had given them the right to think about a home; and sitting out on the doorstep that summer evening, they held consultation about it, and Jurgis took occasion to broach a weighty subject.
<p/>Passing down the avenue to work that morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) had seen two boys leaving an advertisement from house to house; and seeing that there were pictures upon it, Jurgis had asked for one, and had rolled it up and tucked it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) shirt.
<p/>At noontime a man with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been talking had read it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a little about it, with the result that Jurgis had conceived a wild idea.
<p/>It was nearly two feet long, printed on calendered paper, with a selection of colors so bright that they shone even in the moonlight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought out the placard, which was quite a work of art. The center of the placard was occupied by a house, brilliantly painted, new, and dazzling.
<p/>The roof of it was of a purple hue, and trimmed with gold; the house itself was silvery, and the doors and windows red.
<p/>It was a two-story building, with a porch in front, and a very fancy scrollwork around the edges; it was complete in every tiniest detail, even the doorknob, and there was a hammock on the porch and white lace curtains in the windows.
<p/>Underneath this, in one corner, was a picture of a husband and wife in loving embrace; in the opposite corner was a cradle, with fluffy curtains drawn over it, and a smiling cherub hovering upon silver-colored wings.
<p/>For fear that the significance of all this should be lost, there was a label, in Polish, Lithuanian, and German--<div class="bookquote">``Dom. Namai.
<p/>Heim. ''  (<font color='red'><b>German</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why pay rent?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the linguistic circular went on to demand. '' Why not own your own home? Do you know that you can buy one for less than your rent?
<p/>We have built thousands of homes which are now occupied by happy families.''--So it became eloquent, picturing the blissfulness of married life in a house with nothing to pay.
<p/>It even quoted <div class="bookquote">``Home, Sweet Home,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and made bold to translate it into Polish--though for some reason it omitted the Lithuanian of this.
<p/>Perhaps the translator found it a difficult matter to be sentimental in a language in which a sob is known as a gukcziojimas and a smile as a nusiszypsojimas.
<p/>It appeared that this house contained four rooms, besides a basement, and that it might be bought for fifteen hundred dollars, the lot and all.
<p/>Of this, only three hundred dollars had to be paid down, the balance being paid at the rate of twelve dollars a month.
<p/>Over this document the family pored long, while Ona spelled out its contents. These were frightful sums, but then they were in America, where people talked about such without fear.
<p/>They had learned that they would have to pay a rent of nine dollars a month for a flat, and there was no way of doing better, unless the family of twelve was to exist in one or two rooms, as at present.
<p/>If they paid rent, of course, they might pay forever, and be no better off; whereas, if they could only meet the extra expense in the beginning, there would at last come a time when they would not have any rent to pay for the rest of their lives.
<p/>They figured it up. There was a little left of the money belonging to Teta Elzbieta, and there was a little left to Jurgis.
<p/>Marija had about fifty dollars pinned up somewhere in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) stockings, and Grandfather Anthony had part of the money he (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) had gotten for his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) farm.
<p/>If they all combined, they would have enough to make the first payment; and if they had employment, so that they could be sure of the future, it might really prove the best plan.
<p/>It was, of course, not a thing even to be talked of lightly; it was a thing they would have to sift to the bottom.
<p/>And yet, on the other hand, if they were going to make the venture, the sooner they did it the better, for
<p/>Jurgis was used to dirt--there was nothing could scare a man who had been with a railroad gang, where one could gather up the fleas off the floor of the sleeping room by the handful.
<p/>were they not paying rent all the time, and living in a most horrible way besides? But that sort of thing would not do for Ona.
<p/>They must have a better place of some sort soon--Jurgis said it with all the assurance of a man who had just made a dollar and fifty-seven cents in a single day.
<p/>Jurgis was at a loss to understand why, with wages as they were, so many of the people of this district should live the way they did.
<p/>The next day Marija went to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``forelady,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>and was told to report the first of the week, and learn the business of can-painter.
<p/>Marija went home, singing out loud all the way, and was just in time to join Ona and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) stepmother as they were setting out to go and make inquiry concerning the house.
<p/>That evening the three made their report to the men--the thing was altogether as represented in the circular, or at any rate
<p/>The houses lay to the south, about a mile and a half from the yards; they were wonderful bargains, the gentleman had assured them--personally, and for their own good.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could do this, so he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) explained to them, for the reason that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had himself no interest in their sale--he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was merely the agent for a company that had built them.
<p/>These were the last, and the company was going out of business, so if any one wished to take advantage of this wonderful no-rent plan, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would have to be very quick.
<p/>As a matter of fact there was just a little uncertainty as to whether there was a single house left; for the agent had taken so many people to see them, and for all he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) knew the company might have parted with the last.
<p/>Seeing Teta Elzbieta's evident grief at this news, he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) added, after some hesitation, that if they really intended to make a purchase, he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) would send a telephone message at his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) own expense, and have one of the houses kept.
<p/>so the agent had said. So it had finally been arranged--and they were to go and make an inspection the following Sunday morning.
<p/>That was Thursday; and all the rest of the week the killing gang at Brown's worked at full pressure, and Jurgis cleared a dollar seventy-five every day.
<p/>Jurgis was not able to figure, except it was a very simple sum, but Ona was like lightning at such things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) worked out the problem for the family.
<p/>Marija and Jonas were each to pay sixteen dollars a month board, and the old man insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could do the same as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got a place--which might be any day now.
<p/>That was at the rate of ten and one-half dollars a week, or forty-five a month. That would make ninety-three dollars.
<p/>Then Marija and Jonas were between them to take a third share in the house, which would leave only eight dollars a month for Jurgis to contribute to the payment.
<p/>So they would have eighty-five dollars a month--or, supposing that Dede Antanas did not get work at once, seventy dollars a month--which ought surely to be sufficient for the support of a family of twelve.
<p/>An hour before the time on Sunday morning the entire party set out. They had the address written on a piece of paper, which they showed to some one now and then.
<p/>It proved to be a long mile and a half, but they walked it, and half an hour or so later the agent put in an appearance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) was a smooth and florid personage, elegantly dressed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) spoke their language freely, which gave him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) a great advantage in dealing with them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) escorted them to the house, which was one of a long row of the typical frame dwellings of the neighborhood, where architecture is a luxury that is dispensed with.
<p/>Ona's heart sank, for the house was not as it was shown in the picture; the color scheme was different, for one thing, and then it did not seem quite so big.
<p/>It was all brand-new, so the agent told them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) talked so incessantly that they were quite confused, and did not have time to ask many questions.
<p/>There were all sorts of things they had made up their minds to inquire about, but when the time came, they either forgot them or lacked the courage.
<p/>Still, it was freshly painted, and made a considerable show. The other houses in the row did not seem to be new, and few of them seemed to be occupied.
<p/>To press the matter would have seemed to be doubting his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) word, and never in their lives had any one of them ever spoken to a person of the class called <div class="bookquote">``gentleman''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>except with deference and humility.
<p/>The house had a basement, about two feet below the street line, and a single story, about six feet above it, reached by a flight of steps.
<p/>In addition there was an attic, made by the peak of the roof, and having one small window in each end.
<p/>The street in front of the house was unpaved and unlighted, and the view from it consisted of a few exactly similar houses, scattered here and there upon lots grown up with dingy brown weeds.
<p/>The house inside contained four rooms, plastered white; the basement was but a frame, the walls being unplastered and the floor not laid.
<p/>The agent explained that the houses were built that way, as the purchasers generally preferred to finish the basements to suit their own taste.
<p/>The attic was also unfinished--the family had been figuring that in case of an emergency they could rent this attic, but they found that there was not even a floor, nothing but joists, and beneath them the lath and plaster of the ceiling below.
<p/>All of this, however, did not chill their ardor as much as might have been expected, because of the volubility of the agent.
<p/>There was no end to the advantages of the house, as he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) set them forth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) was not silent for an instant; he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) showed them everything, down to the locks on the doors and the catches on the windows, and how to work them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) showed them the sink in the kitchen, with running water and a faucet, something which Teta Elzbieta had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) wildest dreams hoped to possess.
<p/>After a discovery such as that it would have seemed ungrateful to find any fault, and so they tried to shut their eyes to other defects.
<p/>When they ventured to hint at this, the agent's reply was that the purchasers would be moving in shortly. Still, they were peasant people, and they hung on to their money by instinct
<p/>; it was quite in vain that the agent hinted at promptness--they would see, they would see, they told him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>), they could not decide until they had had more time.
<p/>And so they went home again, and all day and evening there was figuring and debating. It was an agony to them to have to make up their minds in a matter such as this.
<p/>They never could agree all together; there were so many arguments upon each side, and one would be obstinate, and no sooner would the rest have convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) than it would transpire that his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) arguments had caused another to waver.
<p/>Once, in the evening, when they were all in harmony, and the house was as good as bought, Szedvilas came in and upset them again.
<p/>Szedvilas had no use for property owning. He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) told them cruel stories of people who had been done to death in this <div class="bookquote">``buying a home''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>swindle.
<p/>They would be almost sure to get into a tight place and lose all their money; and there was no end of expense that one could never foresee; and the house might be good-for-nothing from top to bottom--how was a poor man to know?
<p/>Then, too, they would swindle you with the contract--and how was a poor man to understand anything about a contract? It was all nothing but robbery, and there was no safety but in keeping out of it.
<p/>And pay rent? asked Jurgis. Ah, yes, to be sure, the other answered, that too was robbery. It was all robbery, for a poor man.
<p/>After half an hour of such depressing conversation, they had their minds quite made up that they had been saved at the brink of a precipice; but then Szedvilas went away, and Jonas, who was a sharp little man, reminded them that the delicatessen business was a failure, according to its proprietor, and that this might account for his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) pessimistic views.
<p/>Which, of course, reopened the subject! The controlling factor was that they could not stay where they were--they had to go somewhere.
<p/>And when they gave up the house plan and decided to rent, the prospect of paying out nine dollars a month forever they found just as hard to face.
<p/>All day and all night for nearly a whole week they wrestled with the problem, and then in the end Jurgis took the responsibility.
<p/>Brother Jonas had gotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) job, and was pushing a truck in Durham's; and the killing gang at Brown's continued to work early and late, so that Jurgis grew more confident every hour, more certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) mastership.
<p/>It was the kind of thing the man of the family had to decide and carry through, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told himself. Others might have failed at it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not the failing kind--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would show them how to do it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would work all day, and all night, too, if need be; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never rest until the house was paid for and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) people had a home.
<p/>They had talked about looking at more houses before they made the purchase; but then they did not know where any more were, and they did not know any way of finding out.
<p/>The one they had seen held the sway in their thoughts; whenever they thought of themselves in a house, it was this house that they thought of.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told them, and so in the end the decision was made. And so they went and told the agent that they were ready to make the agreement.
<p/>They knew, as an abstract proposition, that in matters of business all men are to be accounted liars; but they could not but have been influenced by all they had heard from the eloquent agent, and were quite persuaded that the house was something they had run a risk of losing by their delay.
<p/>They drew a deep breath when he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) told them that they were still in time. They were to come on the morrow, and he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) would have the papers all drawn up.
<p/>This matter of papers was one in which Jurgis understood to the full the need of caution; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) could not go himself--every one told him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) could not get a holiday, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) might lose his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) job by asking.
<p/>So there was nothing to be done but to trust it to the women, with Szedvilas, who promised to go with them.
<p/>Jurgis spent a whole evening impressing upon them the seriousness of the occasion--and then finally, out of innumerable hiding places about their persons and in their baggage, came forth the precious wads of money, to be done up tightly in a little bag and sewed fast in the lining of Teta Elzbieta's dress.
<p/>Jurgis had given them so many instructions and warned them against so many perils, that the women were quite pale with fright, and even the imperturbable delicatessen vender, who prided himself upon being a businessman, was ill at ease.
<p/>The agent had the deed all ready, and invited them to sit down and read it; this Szedvilas proceeded to do--a painful and laborious process, during which the agent drummed upon the desk.
<p/>Teta Elzbieta was so embarrassed that the perspiration came out upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) forehead in beads; for was not this reading as much as to say plainly to the gentleman's face that they doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) honesty?
<p/>Early in the morning they sallied forth. Yet Jokubas Szedvilas read on and on; and presently there developed that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had good reason for doing so.
<p/>This was not a deed of sale at all, so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could see--it provided only for the renting of the property!
<p/>It was hard to tell, with all this strange legal jargon, words he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had never heard before; but was not this plain--<div class="bookquote">``the party of the first part hereby covenants and agrees to rent to the said party of the second part!
<p/>For a horrible suspicion had begun dawning in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mind; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knitted his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brows more and more as he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) read. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then again--<div class="bookquote">``a monthly rental of twelve dollars, for a period of eight years and four months! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Szedvilas/Jokubas/Jokubas Szedvilas</b></font>)</div>Then Szedvilas took off his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) spectacles, and looked at the agent, and stammered a question.
<p/>The agent was most polite, and explained that that was the usual formula; that it was always arranged that the property should be merely rented.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) kept trying to show them something in the next paragraph; but Szedvilas could not get by the word <div class="bookquote">``rental'' (<font color='red'><b>Szedvilas/Jokubas/Jokubas Szedvilas</b></font>)</div>--and when he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) translated it to Teta Elzbieta, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) too was thrown into a fright.
<p/>They would not own the home at all, then, for nearly nine years! The agent, with infinite patience, began to explain again; but no explanation would do now.
<p/>Elzbieta had firmly fixed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) mind the last solemn warning of Jurgis: <div class="bookquote">``If there is anything wrong, do not give him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) the money, but go out and get a lawyer.
<p/>It was an agonizing moment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) sat in the chair, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) hands clenched like death, and made a fearful effort, summoning all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) powers, and gasped out her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) purpose.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) expected the agent to fly into a passion, but he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) was, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) bewilderment, as ever imperturbable; he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) even offered to go and get a lawyer for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) declined this.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jokubas translated her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) words. They went a long way, on purpose to find a man who would not be a confederate.
<p/>Then let any one imagine their dismay, when, after half an hour, they came in with a lawyer, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) greet the agent by his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) first name!
<p/>They felt that all was lost; they sat like prisoners summoned to hear the reading of their death warrant. There was nothing more that they could do--they were trapped!
<p/>The lawyer read over the deed, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had read it he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) informed Szedvilas that it was all perfectly regular, that the deed was a blank deed such as was often used in these sales.
<p/>the old man asked--three hundred dollars down, and the balance at twelve dollars a month, till the total of fifteen hundred dollars had been paid?
<p/>And was the price as agreed? Yes, that was correct. And it was for the sale of such and such a house--the house and lot and everything?
<p/>Yes,--and the lawyer showed him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) where that was all written. And it was all perfectly regular--there were no tricks about it of any sort?
<p/>They were poor people, and this was all they had in the world, and if there was anything wrong they would be ruined.
<p/>And so Szedvilas went on, asking one trembling question after another, while the eyes of the women folks were fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) in mute agony.
<p/>And when at last he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had questioned until there was no more questioning to be done, and the time came for them to make up their minds, and either close the bargain or reject it, it was all that poor
<p/>They could not understand what he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was saying, but they knew that upon it their fate depended. Teta Elzbieta could do to keep from bursting into tears.
<p/>Jokubas had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) wished to sign; he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) twice--and what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) say? How did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) know if this lawyer were telling the truth--that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was not in the conspiracy?
<p/>The eyes of every one in the room were upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), awaiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) decision; and at last, half blind with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) began fumbling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) jacket, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had pinned the precious money.
<p/>And yet, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) say so--what excuse could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) give? And she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) brought it out and unwrapped it before the men.
<p/>All of this Ona sat watching, from a corner of the room, twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hands together, meantime, in a fever of fright.
<p/>Ona longed to cry out and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) stepmother to stop, that it was all a trap; but there seemed to be something clutching her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) by the throat, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) could not make a sound.
<p/>And so Teta Elzbieta laid the money on the table, and the agent picked it up and counted it, and then wrote them a receipt for it and passed them the deed.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) gave a sigh of satisfaction, and rose and shook hands with them all, still as smooth and polite as at the beginning.
<p/>Ona had a dim recollection of the lawyer telling Szedvilas that his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) charge was a dollar, which occasioned some debate, and more agony; and then, after they had paid that, too, they went out into the street, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) stepmother clutching the deed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hand.
<p/>So they went home, with a deadly terror gnawing at their souls; and that evening Jurgis came home and heard their story, and that was the end.
<p/>Jurgis was sure that they had been swindled, and were ruined; and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) tore his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hair and cursed like a madman, swearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would kill the agent that very night.
<p/>In the end he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) seized the paper and rushed out of the house, and all the way across the yards to Halsted Street.
<p/>They were so weak from fright that they could not walk, but had to sit down on the way. He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) dragged Szedvilas out from his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) supper, and together they rushed to consult another lawyer.
<p/>When they entered his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) office the lawyer sprang up, for Jurgis looked like a crazy person, with flying hair and bloodshot eyes.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) companion explained the situation, and the lawyer took the paper and began to read it, while Jurgis stood clutching the desk with knotted hands, trembling in every nerve.
<p/>Once or twice the lawyer looked up and asked a question of Szedvilas; the other did not know a word that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was saying, but his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) eyes were fixed upon the lawyer's face, striving in an agony of dread to read his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) mind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) saw the lawyer look up and laugh, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) gave a gasp; the man said something to Szedvilas, and Jurgis turned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) friend, his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) heart almost stopping.
<p/>'' Well?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) panted. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) says it is all right,'' said Szedvilas. '' All right!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) says it is just as it should be.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>And Jurgis, in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) relief, sank down into a chair. '' Are you sure of it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) gasped, and made Szedvilas translate question after question.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) could not hear it often enough; he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) could not ask with enough variations. Yes, they had bought the house, they had really bought it.
<p/>Then Jurgis covered his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) face with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hands, for there were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) felt like a fool.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had had such a horrible fright; strong man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, it left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) almost too weak to stand up.
<p/>The lawyer explained that the rental was a form--the property was said to be merely rented until the last payment had been made, the purpose being to make it easier to turn the party out if he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) did not make the payments.
<p/>It belonged to them, they had only to pay the money and it would be all right. So long as they paid, however, they had nothing to fear, the house was all theirs.
<p/>Jurgis was so grateful that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) paid the half dollar the lawyer asked without winking an eyelash, and then rushed home to tell the news to the family.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) found Ona in a faint and the babies screaming, and the whole house in an uproar--for it had been believed by all that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had gone to murder the agent.
<p/>It was hours before the excitement could be calmed; and all through that cruel night Jurgis would wake up now and then and hear Ona and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) stepmother in the next room, sobbing softly to themselves.
<p/>Chapter 5 They had bought their home. It was hard for them to realize that the wonderful house was theirs to move into whenever they chose.
<p/>They spent all their time thinking about it, and what they were going to put into it. As their week with Aniele was up in three days, they lost no time in getting ready.
<p/>A person who had such a task before him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would not need to look very far in Packingtown--he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had only to walk up the avenue and read the signs, or get into a streetcar, to obtain full information as to pretty much everything a human creature could need.
<p/>They had to make some shift to furnish it, and every instant of their leisure was given to discussing this. It was quite touching, the zeal of people to see that his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) health and happiness were provided for.
<p/>There was a little discourse about cigars, showing him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) exactly why the Thomas Jefferson Five-cent Perfecto was the only cigar worthy of the name.
<p/>Here was a remedy for the smoking habit, twenty-five doses for a quarter, and a cure absolutely guaranteed in ten doses.
<p/>In innumerable ways such as this, the traveler found that somebody had been busied to make smooth his (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) paths through the world, and to let him (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>) know what had been done for him (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>).
<p/>Did the person wish to smoke? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>traveler</b></font>), on the other hand, smoked too much? In Packingtown the advertisements had a style all of their own, adapted to the peculiar population.
<p/>One would be tenderly solicitous. <div class="bookquote">``Is your wife pale? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it would inquire. '' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) discouraged, does she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) drag herself about the house and find fault with everything?
<p/>Why do you not tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to try Dr. Lanahan's Life Preservers?'' Another would be jocular in tone, slapping you on the back, so to speak.
<p/>'' Don't be a chump! '' it would exclaim. <div class="bookquote">``Go and get the Goliath Bunion Cure.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Get a move on you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>would chime in another.
<p/>'' It's easy, if you wear the Eureka Two-fifty Shoe. '' Among these importunate signs was one that had caught the attention of the family by its pictures.
<p/>It showed two very pretty little birds building themselves a home; and Marija had asked an acquaintance to read it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Goliath</b></font>), and told them that it related to the furnishing of a house.
<p/>Feather your nest,'' it ran--and went on to say that it could furnish all the necessary feathers for a four-room nest for the ludicrously small sum of seventy-five dollars.
<p/>The particularly important thing about this offer was that only a small part of the money need be had at once--the rest one might pay a few dollars every month.
<p/>Our friends had to have some furniture, there was no getting away from that; but their little fund of money had sunk so low that they could hardly get to sleep at night, and so they fled to this as their deliverance.
<p/>There was more agony and another paper for Elzbieta to sign, and then one night when Jurgis came home, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was told the breathless tidings that the furniture had arrived and was safely stowed in the house: a parlor set of four pieces, a bedroom set of three pieces, a dining room table and four chairs, a toilet set with beautiful pink roses painted all over it, an assortment of crockery, also with pink roses--and so on.
<p/>One of the plates in the set had been found broken when they unpacked it, and Ona was going to the store the first thing in the morning to make them change it; also they had promised three saucepans, and there had only two come, and did Jurgis think that they were trying to cheat them?
<p/>The next day they went to the house; and when the men came from work they ate a few hurried mouthfuls at Aniele's, and then set to work at the task of carrying their belongings to their new home.
<p/>The distance was in reality over two miles, but Jurgis made two trips that night, each time with a huge pile of mattresses and bedding on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) head, with bundles of clothing and bags and things tied up inside.
<p/>Anywhere else in Chicago he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would have stood a good chance of being arrested; but the policemen in Packingtown were apparently used to these informal movings, and contented themselves with a cursory examination now and then.
<p/>It was quite wonderful to see how fine the house looked, with all the things in it, even by the dim light of a lamp: it was really home, and almost as exciting as the placard had described it.
<p/>Ona was fairly dancing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and Cousin Marija took Jurgis by the arm and escorted him (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) from room to room, sitting in each chair by turns, and then insisting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) should do the same.
<p/>'' One chair squeaked with his (<font color='blue'><b>Cousin</b></font>) great weight, and they screamed with fright, and woke the baby and brought everybody running.
<p/>Altogether it was a great day; and tired as they were, Jurgis and Ona sat up late, contented simply to hold each other and gaze in rapture about the room.
<p/>They were going to be married as soon as they could get everything settled, and a little spare money put by; and this was to be their home--that little room yonder would be theirs!
<p/>They had no money to spend for the pleasure of spending, but there were a few absolutely necessary things, and the buying of these was a perpetual adventure for Ona.
<p/>It must always be done at night, so that Jurgis could go along; and even if it were only a pepper cruet, or half a dozen glasses for ten cents, that was enough for an expedition.
<p/>On Saturday night they came home with a great basketful of things, and spread them out on the table, while every one stood round, and the children climbed up on the chairs, or howled to be lifted up to see.
<p/>There were sugar and salt and tea and crackers, and a can of lard and a milk pail, and a scrubbing brush, and a pair of shoes for the second oldest boy, and a can of oil, and a tack hammer, and a pound of nails.
<p/>These last were to be driven into the walls of the kitchen and the bedrooms, to hang things on; and there was a family discussion as to the place where each one was to be driven.
<p/>Then Jurgis would try to hammer, and hit his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fingers because the hammer was too small, and get mad because Ona had refused to let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pay fifteen cents more and get a bigger hammer; and Ona would be invited to try it herself, and hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) thumb, and cry out, which necessitated the thumb's being kissed by Jurgis.
<p/>It was in truth a never-ending delight, the fixing up of this house. Finally, after every one had had a try, the nails would be driven, and something hung up.
<p/>Jurgis had come home with a big packing box on his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sent Jonas to get another that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had bought.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) meant to take one side out of these tomorrow, and put shelves in them, and make them into bureaus and places to keep things for the bedrooms.
<p/>The nest which had been advertised had not included feathers for quite so many birds as there were in this family.
<p/>They had, of course, put their dining table in the kitchen, and the dining room was used as the bedroom of Teta Elzbieta and five of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) children.
<p/>Ona and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) cousin dragged a mattress into the parlor and slept at night, and the three men and the oldest boy slept in the other room, having nothing but the very level floor to rest on for the present.
<p/>Even so, however, they slept soundly--it was necessary for Teta Elzbieta to pound more than once on the door at a quarter past five every morning.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) would have ready a great pot full of steaming black coffee, and oatmeal and bread and smoked sausages; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) would fix them their dinner pails with more thick slices of bread with lard between them--they could not afford butter--and some onions and a piece of cheese, and so they would tramp away to work.
<p/>This was the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) life that he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) had ever really worked, it seemed to Jurgis; it was the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) had ever had anything to do which took all he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) had in him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>).
<p/>Jurgis had stood with the rest up in the gallery and watched the men on the killing beds, marveling at their speed and power as if they had been wonderful machines; it somehow never occurred to one to think of the flesh-and-blood side of it--that is, not until he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) actually got down into the pit and took off his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) coat.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) and the two youngest slept in the only bed, and the other three had a mattress on the floor. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) saw things in a different light, he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) got at the inside of them.
<p/>The pace they set here, it was one that called for every faculty of a man--from the instant the first steer fell till the sounding of the noon whistle, and again from half-past twelve till
<p/>heaven only knew what hour in the late afternoon or evening , there was never one instant's rest for a man, for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain.
<p/>Jurgis saw how they managed it; there were portions of the work which determined the pace of the rest, and for these they had picked men whom they paid high wages, and whom they changed frequently.
<p/>You might easily pick out these pacemakers, for they worked under the eye of the bosses, and they worked like men possessed.
<p/>This was called <div class="bookquote">``speeding up the gang,''  (<font color='red'><b>any man</b></font>)</div>and if any man could not keep up with the pace, there were hundreds outside begging to try.
<p/>Yet Jurgis did not mind it; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rather enjoyed it. It saved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the necessity of flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms about and fidgeting as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did in most work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would laugh to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran down the line, darting a glance now and then at the man ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>It was not the pleasantest work one could think of, but it was necessary work; and what more had a man the right to ask than a chance to do something useful, and to get good pay for doing it?
<p/>So Jurgis thought, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bold, free way; very much to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) surprise, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that it had a tendency to get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into trouble.
<p/>For most of the men here took a fearfully different view of the thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was quite dismayed when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first began to find it out--that most of the men hated their work.
<p/>It seemed strange, it was even terrible, when you came to find out the universality of the sentiment; but it was certainly the fact--they hated their work.
<p/>They hated the bosses and they hated the owners; they hated the whole place, the whole neighborhood--even the whole city, with an all-inclusive hatred, bitter and fierce.
<p/>When Jurgis would ask them what they meant, they would begin to get suspicious, and content themselves with saying, <div class="bookquote">``Never mind, you stay here and see for yourself.
<p/>Women and little children would fall to cursing about it; it was rotten, rotten as hell--everything was rotten. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>One of the first problems that Jurgis ran upon was that of the unions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>owners</b></font>) had had no experience with unions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>owners</b></font>) had to have it explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>owners</b></font>) that the men were banded together for the purpose of fighting for their rights.
<p/>Jurgis asked them what they meant by their rights, a question in which he (<font color='blue'><b>owners</b></font>) was quite sincere, for he (<font color='blue'><b>owners</b></font>) had not any idea of any rights that he (<font color='blue'><b>owners</b></font>) had, except the right to hunt for a job, and do as he (<font color='blue'><b>owners</b></font>) was told when he (<font color='blue'><b>owners</b></font>) got it.
<p/>There was a delegate of the butcher-helpers' union who came to see Jurgis to enroll him (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>); and when Jurgis found that this meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) would have to part with some of his (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) money, he (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) froze up directly, and the delegate, who was an Irishman and only knew a few words of Lithuanian, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) temper and began to threaten him (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>).
<p/>In the end Jurgis got into a fine rage, and made it sufficiently plain that it would take more than one Irishman to scare him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) into a union.
<p/>Little by little he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) gathered that the main thing the men wanted was to put a stop to the habit of <div class="bookquote">``speeding-up'' (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>; they were trying their best to force a lessening of the pace, for there were some, they said, who could not keep up with it, whom it was killing.
<p/>But Jurgis had no sympathy with such ideas as this--he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) could do the work himself, and so could the rest of them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) declared, if they were good for anything.
<p/>Generally, however, this harmless question would only make his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) fellow workingmen lose their tempers and call him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) a fool. If they couldn't do it, let them go somewhere else.
<p/>Jurgis had not studied the books, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) would not have known how to pronounce <div class="bookquote">``laissez faire'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) had been round the world enough to know that a man has to shift for himself in it, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gets the worst of it, there is nobody to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) holler.
<p/>Yet there have been known to be philosophers and plain men who swore by Malthus in the books, and would, nevertheless, subscribe to a relief fund in time of a famine.
<p/>It was the same with Jurgis, who consigned the unfit to destruction, while going about all day sick at heart because of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) poor old father, who was wandering somewhere in the yards begging for a chance to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread.
<p/>Old Antanas had been a worker ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was a child; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had run away from home when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was twelve, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) father beat him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) for trying to learn to read.
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was a man you might leave alone for a month, if only you had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) understand what you wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) to do in the meantime.
<p/>And now here he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was, worn out in soul and body, and with no more place in the world than a sick dog.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) home, as it happened, and some one who would care for him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) never got a job; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) son could not help thinking, suppose this had not been the case.
<p/>Antanas Rudkus had been into every building in Packingtown by this time, and into nearly every room; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had stood mornings among the crowd of applicants till the very policemen had come to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) face and to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) to go home and give it up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had been likewise to all the stores and saloons for a mile about, begging for some little thing to do; and everywhere they had ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) out, sometimes with curses, and not once even stopping to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) a question.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was a faithful man, too So, after all, there was a crack in the fine structure of Jurgis' faith in things as they are.
<p/>For one evening the old man came home in a great state of excitement, with the tale that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been approached by a man in one of the corridors of the pickle rooms of Durham's, and asked what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would pay to get a job.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not known what to make of this at first; but the man had gone on with matter-of-fact frankness to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a job, provided that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were willing to pay one-third of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wages for it.
<p/>The crack was wide while Dede Antanas was hunting a job--and it was yet wider when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) finally got it. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) a boss?
<p/>Antanas had asked; to which the man had replied that that was nobody's business, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) could do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) said.
<p/>The friend, who was named Tamoszius Kuszleika, was a sharp little man who folded hides on the killing beds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) listened to what Jurgis had to say without seeming at all surprised.
<p/>Jurgis had made some friends by this time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sought one of them and asked what this meant. They were common enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, such cases of petty graft.
<p/>After Jurgis had been there awhile he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would know that the plants were simply honeycombed with rottenness of that sort--the bosses grafted off the men, and they grafted off each other; and some day the superintendent would find out about the boss, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) would graft off the boss.
<p/>It was simply some boss who proposed to add a little to his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) income. Warming to the subject, Tamoszius went on to explain the situation.
<p/>Here was Durham's, for instance, owned by a man who was trying to make as much money out of it as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could, and did not care in the least how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did it; and underneath him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ranged in ranks and grades like an army, were managers and superintendents and foremen, each one driving the man next below him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and trying to squeeze out of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as much work as possible.
<p/>And all the men of the same rank were pitted against each other; the accounts of each were kept separately, and every man lived in terror of losing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) job, if another made a better record than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>So from top to bottom the place was simply a seething caldron of jealousies and hatreds; there was no loyalty or decency anywhere about it, there was no place in it where a man counted for anything against a dollar.
<p/>It must have been old Durham in the beginning; it was a heritage which the self-made merchant had left to his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) son, along with his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) millions.
<p/>Jurgis would find out these things for himself, if he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) stayed there long enough; it was the men who had to do all the dirty jobs, and so there was no deceiving them; and they caught the spirit of the place, and did like all the rest.
<p/>Jurgis had come there, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) was going to make himself useful, and rise and become a skilled man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would soon find out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) error--for nobody rose in Packingtown by doing good work.
<p/>You could lay that down for a rule--if you met a man who was rising in Packingtown, you met a knave.
<p/>That man who had been sent to Jurgis' father by the boss, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would rise; the man who told tales and spied upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellows would rise; but the man who minded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own business and did his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work--why, they would <div class="bookquote">``speed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>till they had worn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out, and then they would throw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) into the gutter.
<p/>And worse than there being no decency, there was not even any honesty. The reason for that? Who could say? Jurgis went home with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head buzzing.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not bring himself to believe such things--no, it could not be so. Tamoszius was simply another of the grumblers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a man who spent all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) time fiddling; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go to parties at night and not get home till sunrise, and so of course he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not feel like work.
<p/>Then, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a puny little chap; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been left behind in the race, and that was why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sore.
<p/>And yet so many strange things kept coming to Jurgis' notice every day! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried to persuade his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father to have nothing to do with the offer.
<p/>But old Antanas had begged until he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was worn out, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) courage was gone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) wanted a job, any sort of a job.
<p/>So the next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) went and found the man who had spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and promised to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a third of all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earned; and that same day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was put to work in Durham's cellars.
<p/>It was a <div class="bookquote">``pickle room,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>where there was never a dry spot to stand upon, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to take nearly the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first week's earnings to buy him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a pair of heavy-soled boots.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``squeedgie''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>man; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) job was to go about all day with a long-handled mop, swabbing up the floor.
<p/>Now Antanas Rudkus was the meekest man that God ever put on earth; and so Jurgis found it a striking confirmation of what the men all said, that his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father had been at work only two days before he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) came home as bitter as any of them, and cursing Durham's with all the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) soul.
<p/>For they had set him (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) to cleaning out the traps; and the family sat round and listened in wonder while he (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) told them what that meant.
<p/>It seemed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) was working in the room where the men prepared the beef for canning, and the beef had lain in vats full of chemicals, and men with great forks speared it out and dumped it into trucks, to be taken to the cooking room.
<p/>When they had speared out all they could reach, they emptied the vat on the floor, and then with shovels scraped up the balance and dumped it into the truck.
<p/>This floor was filthy, yet they set Antanas with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) mop slopping the <div class="bookquote">``pickle''  (<font color='red'><b>Antanas/Dede Antanas</b></font>)</div>into a hole that connected with a sink, where it was caught and used over again forever; and if that were not enough, there was a trap in the pipe, where all the scraps of meat and odds and ends of refuse were caught, and every few days it was the old man's task to clean these out, and shovel their contents into one of the trucks with the rest of the meat!
<p/>Except that it was damp and dark, it was not an unpleasant job, in summer. This was the experience of Antanas; and then there came also Jonas and Marija with tales to tell.
<p/>Marija was working for one of the independent packers, and was quite beside herself and outrageous with triumph over the sums of money she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was making as a painter of cans.
<p/>But one day she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) walked home with a pale-faced little woman who worked opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), Jadvyga Marcinkus by name, and Jadvyga told her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), Marija, had chanced to get her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) job.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had taken the place of an Irishwoman who had been working in that factory ever since any one could remember.
<p/>For over fifteen years, so she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) declared. Mary Dennis was her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) name, and a long time ago she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had been seduced, and had a little boy
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a cripple, and an epileptic, but still he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was all that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had in the world to love, and they had lived in a little room alone somewhere back of Halsted Street, where the Irish were.
<p/>Mary had had consumption, and all day long you might hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) coughing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) worked; of late she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been going all to pieces, and when Marija came, the <div class="bookquote">``forelady''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>had suddenly decided to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) off.
<p/>The fact that Mary had been there so long had not made any difference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)--it was doubtful if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) even knew that, for both the forelady and the superintendent were new people, having only been there two or three years themselves.
<p/>Jadvyga did not know what had become of the poor creature; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would have gone to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), but had been sick herself.
<p/>The forelady had to come up to a certain standard herself, and could not stop for sick people, Jadvyga explained. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had pains in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) back all the time, Jadvyga explained, and feared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had womb trouble.
<p/>It was not fit work for a woman, handling fourteen-pound cans all day. It was a striking circumstance that Jonas, too, had gotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) job by the misfortune of some other person.
<p/>Jonas pushed a truck loaded with hams from the smoke rooms on to an elevator, and thence to the packing rooms.
<p/>The trucks were all of iron, and heavy, and they put about threescore hams on each of them, a load of more than a quarter of a ton.
<p/>On the uneven floor it was a task for a man to start one of these trucks, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a giant; and when it was once started he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) naturally tried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best to keep it going.
<p/>There was always the boss prowling about, and if there was a second's delay he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) would fall to cursing; Lithuanians and Slovaks and such, who could not understand what was said to them, the bosses were wont to kick about the place like so many dogs.
<p/>Therefore these trucks went for the most part on the run; and the predecessor of Jonas had been jammed against the wall by one and crushed in a horrible and nameless manner.
<p/>All of these were sinister incidents; but they were trifles compared to what Jurgis saw with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) own eyes before long.
<p/>One curious thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) had noticed, the very first day, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) profession of shoveler of guts; which was the sharp trick of the floor bosses whenever there chanced to come a <div class="bookquote">``slunk''  (<font color='red'><b>the floor bosses</b></font>)</div>calf.
<p/>Any man who knows anything about butchering knows that the flesh of a cow that is about to calve, or has just calved, is not fit for food.
<p/>A good many of these came every day to the packing houses--and, of course, if they had chosen, it would have been an easy matter for the packers to keep them till they were fit for food.
<p/>But for the saving of time and fodder, it was the law that cows of that sort came along with the others, and whoever noticed it would tell the boss, and the boss would start up a conversation with the government inspector, and the two would stroll away.
<p/>So in a trice the carcass of the cow would be cleaned out, and entrails would have vanished; it was Jurgis' task to slide them into the trap, calves and all, and on the floor below they took out these <div class="bookquote">``slunk''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>calves, and butchered them for meat, and used even the skins of them.
<p/>One day a man slipped and hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leg; and that afternoon, when the last of the cattle had been disposed of, and the men were leaving, Jurgis was ordered to remain and do some special work which this injured man had usually done.
<p/>It was late, almost dark, and the government inspectors had all gone, and there were only a dozen or two of men on the floor.
<p/>That day they had killed about four thousand cattle, and these cattle had come in freight trains from far states, and some of them had got hurt.
<p/>There were some with broken legs, and some with gored sides; there were some that had died, from what cause no one could say; and they were all to be disposed of, here in darkness and silence.
<p/>Downers,'' the men called them; and the packing house had a special elevator upon which they were raised to the killing beds, where the gang proceeded to handle them, with an air of businesslike nonchalance which said plainer than any words that it was a matter of everyday routine.
<p/>It took a couple of hours to get them out of the way, and in the end Jurgis saw them go into the chilling rooms with the rest of the meat, being carefully scattered here and there so that they could not be identified.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) came home that night he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was in a very somber mood, having begun to see at last how those might be right who had laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) faith in America.
<p/>Chapter 6 Jurgis and Ona were very much in love; they had waited a long time--it was now well into the second year, and Jurgis judged everything by the criterion of its helping or hindering their union.
<p/>'' All his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) thoughts were there; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) accepted the family because it was a part of Ona. And he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was interested in the house because it was to be Ona's home.
<p/>Even the tricks and cruelties he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) saw at Durham's had little meaning for him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) just then, save as they might happen to affect his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) future with Ona.
<p/>The marriage would have been at once, if they had had their way; but this would mean that they would have to do without any wedding feast, and when they suggested this they came into conflict with the old people.
<p/>To Teta Elzbieta especially the very suggestion was an affliction. What! she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) would cry. To be married on the roadside like a parcel of beggars!
<p/>No!--Elzbieta had some traditions behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had been a person of importance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) girlhood--had lived on a big estate and had servants, and might have married well and been a lady, but for the fact that there had been nine daughters and no sons in the family.
<p/>They were not going to lose all caste, even if they had come to be unskilled laborers in Packingtown; and that Ona had even talked of omitting a veselija was enough to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) stepmother lying awake all night.
<p/>It was in vain for them to say that they had so few friends; they were bound to have friends in time, and then the friends would talk about it.
<p/>They must not give up what was right for a little money--if they did, the money would never do them any good, they could depend upon that.
<p/>And Elzbieta would call upon Dede Antanas to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>); there was a fear in the souls of these two, lest this journey to a new country might somehow undermine the old home virtues of their children.
<p/>The very first Sunday they had all been taken to mass; and poor as they were, Elzbieta had felt it advisable to invest a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) resources in a representation of the babe of Bethlehem, made in plaster, and painted in brilliant colors.
<p/>Though it was only a foot high, there was a shrine with four snow-white steeples, and the Virgin standing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) child in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) arms, and the kings and shepherds and wise men bowing down before him (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>).
<p/>It had cost fifty cents; but Elzbieta had a feeling that money spent for such things was not to be counted too closely, it would come back in hidden ways.
<p/>No! Even so, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) knew what was decent, and clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) traditions with desperation. The piece was beautiful on the parlor mantel, and one could not have a home without some sort of ornament.
<p/>The cost of the wedding feast would, of course, be returned to them; but the problem was to raise it even temporarily.
<p/>They had been in the neighborhood so short a time that they could not get much credit, and there was no one except Szedvilas from whom they could borrow even a little.
<p/>They could not possibly manage it decently for less than two hundred dollars, and even though they were welcome to count in the whole of the earnings of Marija and Jonas, as a loan, they could not hope to raise this sum in less than four or five months.
<p/>So Ona began thinking of seeking employment herself, saying that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had even ordinarily good luck, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) might be able to take two months off the time.
<p/>They were just beginning to adjust themselves to this necessity, when out of the clear sky there fell a thunderbolt upon them--a calamity that scattered all their hopes to the four winds.
<p/>About a block away from them there lived another Lithuanian family, consisting of an elderly widow and one grown son; their name was Majauszkis, and our friends struck up an acquaintance with them before long.
<p/>One evening they came over for a visit, and naturally the first subject upon which the conversation turned was the neighborhood and its history; and then Grandmother Majauszkiene, as the old lady was called, proceeded to recite to them a string of horrors that fairly froze their blood.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a wrinkled-up and wizened personage--she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have been eighty--and as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mumbled the grim story through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) toothless gums, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seemed a very old witch to them.
<p/>Grandmother Majauszkiene had lived in the midst of misfortune so long that it had come to be her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) element, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talked about starvation, sickness, and death as other people might about weddings and holidays.
<p/>Evening after evening Jurgis and Ona would sit and figure the expenses, calculating the term of their separation. The thing came gradually.
<p/>In the first place as to the house they had bought, it was not new at all, as they had supposed; it was about fifteen years old, and there was nothing new upon it but the paint, which was so bad that it needed to be put on new every year or two.
<p/>The house was one of a whole row that was built by a company which existed to make money by swindling poor people.
<p/>The family had paid fifteen hundred dollars for it, and it had not cost the builders five hundred, when it was new.
<p/>Grandmother Majauszkiene knew that because her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) son belonged to a political organization with a contractor who put up exactly such houses.
<p/>They used the very flimsiest and cheapest material; they built the houses a dozen at a time, and they cared about nothing at all except the outside shine.
<p/>The family could take her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) word as to the trouble they would have, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) had been through it all--she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) son had bought their house in exactly the same way.
<p/>They had fooled the company, however, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) son was a skilled man, who made as high as a hundred dollars a month, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had sense enough not to marry, they had been able to pay for the house.
<p/>Grandmother Majauszkiene saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) friends were puzzled at this remark; they did not quite see how paying for the house was <div class="bookquote">``fooling the company.
<p/>Cheap as the houses were, they were sold with the idea that the people who bought them would not be able to pay for them.
<p/>When they failed--if it were only by a single month--they would lose the house and all that they had paid on it, and then the company would sell it over again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>Evidently they were very inexperienced. And did they often get a chance to do that? Dieve! -LRB-Grandmother Majauszkiene raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) hands.-RRB-
<p/>They might ask any one who knew anything at all about Packingtown as to that; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) had been living here ever since this house was built, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) could tell them all about it.
<p/>They did it--how often no one could say, but certainly more than half of the time. And had it ever been sold before?
<p/>Why, since it had been built, no less than four families that their informant could name had tried to buy it and failed.
<p/>The families had all been of different nationalities--there had been a representative of several races that had displaced each other in the stockyards.
<p/>Grandmother Majauszkiene had come to America with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) son at a time when so far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) knew there was only one other Lithuanian family in the district; the workers had all been Germans then--skilled cattle butchers that the packers had brought from abroad to start the business.
<p/>Susimilkie! She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) would tell them a little about it. The first family had been Germans. Afterward, as cheaper labor had come, these Germans had moved away.
<p/>There were a few colonies of them still here, enough to run all the unions and the police force and get all the graft; but most of those who were working in the packing houses had gone away at the next drop in wages--after the big strike.
<p/>The next were the Irish--there had been six or eight years when Packingtown had been a regular Irish city. The Bohemians had come then, and after them the Poles.
<p/>People said that old man Durham himself was responsible for these immigrations; he (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) had sworn that he (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) would fix the people of Packingtown so that they would never again call a strike on him (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) had sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Durham</b></font>) agents into every city and village in Europe to spread the tale of the chances of work and high wages at the stockyards.
<p/>The people had come in hordes; and old Durham had squeezed them tighter and tighter, speeding them up and grinding them to pieces and sending for new ones.
<p/>The Poles, who had come by tens of thousands, had been driven to the wall by the Lithuanians, and now the Lithuanians were giving way to the Slovaks.
<p/>Who there was poorer and more miserable than the Slovaks, Grandmother Majauszkiene had no idea, but the packers would find them, never fear.
<p/>It was easy to bring them, for wages were really much higher, and it was only when it was too late that the poor people found out that everything else was higher too.
<p/>By and by they would have their revenge, though, for the thing was getting beyond human endurance, and the people would rise and murder the packers.
<p/>Grandmother Majauszkiene was a socialist, or some such strange thing; another son of hers was working in the mines of Siberia, and the old lady herself had made speeches in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) time--which made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seem all the more terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) present auditors.
<p/>They were like rats in a trap, that was the truth; and more of them were piling in every day. They called her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) back to the story of the house.
<p/>To be sure there had been a great many of them, which was a common failing in Packingtown; but they had worked hard, and the father had been a steady man, and they had a good deal more than half paid for the house.
<p/>Then there had come the Irish, and there had been lots of them, too; the husband drank and beat the children--the neighbors could hear them shrieking any night.
<p/>They were behind with their rent all the time, but the company was good to them; there was some politics back of that,
<p/>Grandmother Majauszkiene could not say just what, but the Laffertys had belonged to the <div class="bookquote">``War Whoop League,''  (<font color='red'><b>Majauszkiene</b></font>)</div>which was a sort of political club of all the thugs and rowdies in the district; and if you belonged to that, you could never be arrested for anything.
<p/>Once upon a time old Lafferty had been caught with a gang that had stolen cows from several of the poor people of the neighborhood and butchered them in an old shanty back of the yards and sold them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lafferty</b></font>) had been in jail only three days for it, and had come out laughing, and had not even lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Lafferty</b></font>) place in the packing house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lafferty</b></font>) had gone all to ruin with the drink, however, and lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Lafferty</b></font>) power; one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lafferty</b></font>) sons, who was a good man, had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Lafferty</b></font>) and the family up for a year or two, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Lafferty</b></font>) had got sick with consumption.
<p/>The German family had been a good sort. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Lafferty</b></font>) had been killed in an elevator accident in Durham's. That was another thing, Grandmother Majauszkiene interrupted herself--this house was unlucky.
<p/>Nobody could tell why that was; there must be something about the house, or the way it was built--some folks said it was because the building had been begun in the dark of the moon.
<p/>Every family that lived in it, some one was sure to get consumption. There were dozens of houses that way in Packingtown.
<p/>Sometimes there would be a particular room that you could point out-- if anybody slept in that room he (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) was just as good as dead.
<p/>With this house it had been the Irish first; and then a Bohemian family had lost a child of it--though, to be sure, that was uncertain, since it was hard to tell what was the matter with children who worked in the yards.
<p/>At this remark the family looked puzzled, and Grandmother Majauszkiene again had to make an explanation--that it was against the law for children to work before they were sixteen.
<p/>In those days there had been no law about the age of children--the packers had worked all but the babies. What was the sense of that?
<p/>Well, there was no need to worry, Grandmother Majauszkiene said--the law made no difference except that it forced people to lie about the ages of their children.
<p/>One would like to know what the lawmakers expected them to do; there were families that had no possible means of support except the children, and the law provided them no other way of getting a living.
<p/>Very often a man could get no work in Packingtown for months, while a child could go and get a place easily; there was always some new machine, by which the packers could get as much work out of a child as they had been able to get out of a man, and for a third of the pay.
<p/>they asked. They had been thinking of letting little Stanislovas go to work. To come back to the house again, it was the woman of the next family that had died.
<p/>That was after they had been there nearly four years, and this woman had had twins regularly every year--and there had been more than you could count when they moved in.
<p/>After she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) died the man would go to work all day and leave them to shift for themselves--the neighbors would help them now and then, for they would almost freeze to death.
<p/>At the end there were three days that they were alone, before it was found out that the father was dead.
<p/>Then the children had been taken away, and the company had sold the house that very same week to a party of emigrants.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``floorsman''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>at Jones's, and a wounded steer had broken loose and mashed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) against a pillar. So this grim old women went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>children</b></font>) tale of horrors.
<p/>How much of it was exaggeration--who could tell? It was only too plausible. There was that about consumption, for instance. They knew nothing about consumption
<p/>It seemed to shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) all over, and it never stopped; you could see a red stain wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) had spit upon the floor.
<p/>whatever, except that it made people cough; and for two weeks they had been worrying about a coughing-spell of Antanas. And yet all these things were as nothing to what came a little later.
<p/>They had begun to question the old lady as to why one family had been unable to pay, trying to show her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) by figures that it ought to have been possible; and Grandmother Majauszkiene had disputed their figures--<div class="bookquote">``You say twelve dollars a month; but that does not include the interest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Majauszkiene</b></font>)</div>Then they stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Interest! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>they cried. '' Interest on the money you still owe,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) answered. ''
<p/>But we don't have to pay any interest! '' they exclaimed, three or four at once. '' We only have to pay twelve dollars each month.
<p/>'' And for this she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) laughed at them. '' You are like all the rest,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``they trick you and eat you alive.
<p/>Then, with a horrible sinking of the heart, Teta Elzbieta unlocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) bureau and brought out the paper that had already caused them so many agonies.
<p/>They never sell the houses without interest. Get your deed, and see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now they sat round, scarcely breathing, while the old lady, who could read English, ran over it.
<p/>Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, finally, <div class="bookquote">``here it is, of course: `With interest thereon monthly, at the rate of seven per cent per annum.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' And there followed a dead silence. '' What does that mean? '' asked Jurgis finally, almost in a whisper.
<p/>That means,'' replied the other, <div class="bookquote">``that you have to pay them seven dollars next month, as well as the twelve dollars.
<p/>It was sickening, like a nightmare, in which suddenly something gives way beneath you, and you feel yourself sinking, sinking, down into bottomless abysses.
<p/>As if in a flash of lightning they saw themselves--victims of a relentless fate, cornered, trapped, in the grip of destruction.
<p/>All the fair structure of their hopes came crashing about their ears.--And all the time the old woman was going on talking.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Then again there was not a sound. They wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would be still; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice sounded like the croaking of some dismal raven.
<p/>Jurgis sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hands clenched and beads of perspiration on his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) forehead, and there was a great lump in Ona's throat, choking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>Then suddenly Teta Elzbieta broke the silence with a wail, and Marija began to wring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) hands and sob, <div class="bookquote">``Ai! Ai!
<p/>Beda man! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>All their outcry did them no good, of course. There sat Grandmother Majauszkiene, unrelenting, typifying fate. No, of course it was not fair, but then fairness had nothing to do with it.
<p/>But it was in the deed, and that was all that was necessary, as they would find when the time came.
<p/>And of course they had not known it. They had not been intended to know it. Somehow or other they got rid of their guest, and then they passed a night of lamentation.
<p/>In the morning, of course, most of them had to go to work, the packing houses would not stop for their sorrows; but by seven o'clock
<p/>The children woke up and found out that something was wrong, and they wailed and would not be comforted. Ona and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) stepmother were standing at the door of the office of the agent.
<p/>And then Teta Elzbieta broke forth into protestations and reproaches, so that the people outside stopped and peered in at the window.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) told them, when he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) came, it was quite true that they would have to pay interest. The agent was as bland as ever.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had not told them, simply because he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had supposed they would understand that they had to pay interest upon their debt, as a matter of course.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) was deeply pained, he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) said. So they came away, and Ona went down to the yards, and at noontime saw Jurgis and told him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>).
<p/>Jurgis took it stolidly--he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) mind to it by this time. It was part of fate; they would manage it somehow--he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) usual answer, <div class="bookquote">``I will work harder.
<p/>It would upset their plans for a time; and it would perhaps be necessary for Ona to get work after all.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then Ona added that Teta Elzbieta had decided that little Stanislovas would have to work too. It was not fair to let Jurgis and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) support the family--the family would have to help as it could.
<p/>Previously Jurgis had scouted this idea, but now knit his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) brows and nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) head slowly--yes, perhaps it would be best; they would all have to make some sacrifices now.
<p/>So Ona set out that day to hunt for work; and at night Marija came home saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had met a girl named Jasaityte who had a friend that worked in one of the wrapping rooms in Brown's, and might get a place for Ona there; only the forelady was the kind that takes presents--it was no use for any one to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) for a place unless at the same time they slipped a ten-dollar bill into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hand.
<p/>So negotiations were opened, and after an interview Ona came home and reported that the forelady seemed to like her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), and had said that, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was not sure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) might be able to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) at work sewing covers on hams, a job at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would earn as much as eight or ten dollars a week.
<p/>Jurgis was not in the least surprised at this now--he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) merely asked what the wages of the place would be. That was a bid, so Marija reported, after consulting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) friend; and then there was an anxious conference at home.
<p/>The work was done in one of the cellars, and Jurgis did not want Ona to work in such a place; but then it was easy work, and one could not have everything.
<p/>So in the end Ona, with a ten-dollar bill burning a hole in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) palm, had another interview with the forelady.
<p/>Meantime Teta Elzbieta had taken Stanislovas to the priest and gotten a certificate to the effect that he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was two years older than he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was; and with it the little boy now sallied forth to make his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fortune in the world.
<p/>It chanced that Durham had just put in a wonderful new lard machine, and when the special policeman in front of the time station saw Stanislovas and his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) document, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) smiled to himself and told him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) to go--``Czia!
<p/>And so Stanislovas went down a long stone corridor, and up a flight of stairs, which took him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) into a room lighted by electricity, with the new machines for filling lard cans at work in it.
<p/>The lard was finished on the floor above, and it came in little jets, like beautiful, wriggling, snow-white snakes of unpleasant odor.
<p/>There were several kinds and sizes of jets, and after a certain precise quantity had come out, each stopped automatically, and the wonderful machine made a turn, and took the can under another jet, and so on, until it was filled neatly to the brim, and pressed tightly, and smoothed off.
<p/>To attend to all this and fill several hundred cans of lard per hour, there were necessary two human creatures, one of whom knew how to place an empty lard can on a certain spot every few seconds, and the other of whom knew how to take a full lard can off a certain spot every few seconds and set it upon a tray.
<p/>And so, after little Stanislovas had stood gazing timidly about him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for a few minutes, a man approached him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and asked what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted, to which Stanislovas said, <div class="bookquote">``Job.
<p/>Once or twice every year a state inspector would come wandering through the packing plants, asking a child here and there how old he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) was; and so the packers were very careful to comply with the law, which cost them as much trouble as was now involved in the boss's taking the document from the little boy, and glancing at it, and then sending it to the office to be filed away.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) set some one else at a different job, and showed the lad how to place a lard can every time the empty arm of the remorseless machine came to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>); and so was decided the place in the universe of little Stanislovas, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) destiny till the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) days.
<p/>Hour after hour, day after day, year after year, it was fated that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) should stand upon a certain square foot of floor from seven in the morning until noon, and again from half-past twelve till half-past five, making never a motion and thinking never a thought, save for the setting of lard cans.
<p/>In summer the stench of the warm lard would be nauseating, and in winter the cans would all but freeze to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) naked little fingers in the unheated cellar.
<p/>Half the year it would be dark as night when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) went in to work, and dark as night again when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) came out, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would never know what the sun looked like on weekdays.
<p/>And for this, at the end of the week, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would carry home three dollars to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) family, being his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pay at the rate of five cents per hour--just about his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) proper share of the total earnings of the million and three-quarters of children who are now engaged in earning their livings in the United States.
<p/>And meantime, because they were young, and hope is not to be stifled before its time, Jurgis and Ona were again calculating; for they had discovered that the wages of Stanislovas would a little more than pay the interest, which left them just about as they had been before!
<p/>It would be but fair to them to say that the little boy was delighted with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) work, and at the idea of earning a lot of money; and also that the two were very much in love with each other.
<p/>All summer long the family toiled, and in the fall they had money enough for Jurgis and Ona to be married according to home traditions of decency.
<p/>In the latter part of November they hired a hall, and invited all their new acquaintances, who came and left them over a hundred dollars in debt.
<p/>Czia! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Stanislovas</b></font>)</div>pointing. '' Then the man said <div class="bookquote">``How old?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and Stanislovas answered, <div class="bookquote">``Sixtin. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Stanislovas</b></font>)</div>Chapter 7 It was a bitter and cruel experience, and it plunged them into an agony of despair.
<p/>Such a pitiful beginning it was for their married life; they loved each other so, and they could not have the briefest respite!
<p/>It was a time when everything cried out to them that they ought to be happy; when wonder burned in their hearts, and leaped into flame at the slightest breath.
<p/>They were shaken to the depths of them, with the awe of love realized--and was it so very weak of them that they cried out for a little peace?
<p/>Such a time, of all times, for them to have it, when their hearts were made tender! They had opened their hearts, like flowers to the springtime, and the merciless winter had fallen upon them.
<p/>Over them, relentless and savage, there cracked the lash of want; the morning after the wedding it sought them as they slept, and drove them out before daybreak to work.
<p/>Ona was scarcely able to stand with exhaustion; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) were to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place they would be ruined, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would surely lose it if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) were not on time that day.
<p/>They wondered if ever any love that had blossomed in the world had been so crushed and trampled! They all had to go, even little Stanislovas, who was ill from overindulgence in sausages and sarsaparilla.
<p/>All that day he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) stood at his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) lard machine, rocking unsteadily, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) eyes closing in spite of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) all but lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place even so, for the foreman booted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) twice to waken him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>It was fully a week before they were all normal again, and meantime, with whining children and cross adults, the house was not a pleasant place to live in.
<p/>Jurgis lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) temper very little, however, all things considered. It was because of Ona; the least glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was always enough to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) control himself.
<p/>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was not fitted for such a life as this; and a hundred times a day, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would clench his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hands and fling himself again at the task before him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was so sensitive She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was too good for him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) told himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was afraid, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>So long he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had hungered to possess her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), but now that the time had come he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had not earned the right;
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was resolved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) should never find this out, and so was always on the watch to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) did not betray any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) ugly self; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would take care even in little matters, such as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) manners, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) habit of swearing when things went wrong.
<p/>that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) trusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) so was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) own simple goodness, and no virtue of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>). The tears came so easily into Ona's eyes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) so appealingly
<p/>It was true that more things were going on at this time in the mind of Jurgis than ever had in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) life before.
<p/>--it kept Jurgis quite busy making resolutions, in addition to all the other things he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had on his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had to protect her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), to do battle for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) against the horror he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) saw about them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had to look to, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) failed she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would be lost; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would wrap his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) arms about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), and try to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) from the world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had learned the ways of things about him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) now. It was a war of each against all, and the devil take the hindmost.
<p/>You went about with your soul full of suspicion and hatred; you understood that you were environed by hostile powers that were trying to get your money, and who used all the virtues to bait their traps with.
<p/>The store-keepers plastered up their windows with all sorts of lies to entice you; the very fences by the wayside, the lampposts and telegraph poles, were pasted over with lies.
<p/>You did not give feasts to other people, you waited for them to give feasts to you. The great corporation which employed you lied to you, and lied to the whole country--from top to bottom
<p/>it was nothing but one gigantic lie. So Jurgis said that he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) understood it; and yet it was really pitiful, for the struggle was so unfair
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) was, for instance, vowing upon his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) knees that he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) would save Ona from harm, and only a week later she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was suffering atrociously, and from the blow of an enemy that he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) could not possibly have thwarted.
<p/>There came a day when the rain fell in torrents; and it being December, to be wet with it and have to sit all day long in one of the cold cellars of Brown's was no laughing matter.
<p/>Ona was a working girl, and did not own waterproofs and such things, and so Jurgis took her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) on the streetcar.
<p/>--some had so much the advantage! Now it chanced that this car line was owned by gentlemen who were trying to make money.
<p/>And the city having passed an ordinance requiring them to give transfers, they had fallen into a rage; and first they had made a rule that transfers could be had only when the fare was paid; and later, growing still uglier, they had made another--that the passenger must ask for the transfer, the conductor was not allowed to offer it.
<p/>Now Ona had been told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was to get a transfer; but it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) way to speak up, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) merely waited, following the conductor about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) eyes, wondering when he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) would think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>Not knowing what to make of this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) began to argue with the conductor, in a language of which he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) did not understand a word.
<p/>When at last the time came for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) to get out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) asked for the transfer, and was refused. After warning her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) several times, he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) pulled the bell and the car went on--at which Ona burst into tears.
<p/>At the next corner she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) got out, of course; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had no more money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had to walk the rest of the way to the yards in the pouring rain.
<p/>And so all day long she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) sat shivering, and came home at night with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) teeth chattering and pains in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) head and back.
<p/>The forewoman was especially severe with Ona, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was obstinate on account of having been refused a holiday the day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) wedding.
<p/>Ona had an idea that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``forelady''  (<font color='red'><b>Ona/Little Ona</b></font>)</div>did not like to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) girls marry--perhaps because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was old and ugly and unmarried herself.
<p/>For two weeks afterward she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) suffered cruelly--and yet every day she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had to drag herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) work. There were many such dangers, in which the odds were all against them.
<p/>Their children were not as well as they had been at home; but how could they know that there was no sewer to their house, and that the drainage of fifteen years was in a cesspool under it?
<p/>How could they know that the pale-blue milk that they bought around the corner was watered, and doctored with formaldehyde besides?
<p/>When the children were not well at home, Teta Elzbieta would gather herbs and cure them; now she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was obliged to go to the drugstore and buy extracts--and
<p/>How could they find out that their tea and coffee, their sugar and flour, had been doctored; that their canned peas had been colored with copper salts, and their fruit jams with aniline dyes?
<p/>And even if they had known it, what good would it have done them, since there was no place within miles of them where any other sort was to be had?
<p/>The bitter winter was coming, and they had to save money to get more clothing and bedding; but it would not matter in the least how much they saved, they could not get anything to keep them warm.
<p/>All the clothing that was to be had in the stores was made of cotton and shoddy, which is made by tearing old clothes to pieces and weaving the fiber again.
<p/>If they paid higher prices, they might get frills and fanciness, or be cheated; but genuine quality they could not obtain for love nor money.
<p/>A young friend of Szedvilas', recently come from abroad, had become a clerk in a store on Ashland Avenue, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) narrated with glee a trick that had been played upon an unsuspecting countryman by his (<font color='blue'><b>countryman</b></font>) boss.
<p/>The customer had desired to purchase an alarm clock, and the boss had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) two exactly similar, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) that the price of one was a dollar and of the other a dollar seventy-five.
<p/>Upon being asked what the difference was, the man had wound up the first halfway and the second all the way, and showed the customer how the latter made twice as much noise; upon which the customer remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a sound sleeper, and had better take the more expensive clock!
<p/>There is a poet who sings that <div class="bookquote">``Deeper their heart grows and nobler their bearing, Whose youth in the fires of anguish hath died.
<p/>But it was not likely that he (<font color='blue'><b>poet</b></font>) had reference to the kind of anguish that comes with destitution, that is so endlessly bitter and cruel, and yet so sordid and petty, so ugly, so humiliating--unredeemed by the slightest touch of dignity or even of pathos.
<p/>It is a kind of anguish that poets have not commonly dealt with; its very words are not admitted into the vocabulary of poets--the details of it cannot be told in polite society at all.
<p/>How, for instance, could any one expect to excite sympathy among lovers of good literature by telling how a family found their home alive with vermin, and of all the suffering and inconvenience and humiliation they were put to, and the hard-earned money they spent, in efforts to get rid of them?
<p/>After long hesitation and uncertainty they paid twenty-five cents for a big package of insect powder--a patent preparation which chanced to be ninety-five per cent gypsum, a harmless earth which had cost about two cents to prepare.
<p/>Of course it had not the least effect, except upon a few roaches which had the misfortune to drink water after eating it, and so got their inwards set in a coating of plaster of Paris.
<p/>The family, having no idea of this, and no more money to throw away, had nothing to do but give up and submit to one more misery for the rest of their days.
<p/>The winter came, and the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) worked was a dark, unheated cellar, where you could see your breath all day, and where your fingers sometimes tried to freeze.
<p/>So the old man's cough grew every day worse, until there came a time when it hardly ever stopped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become a nuisance about the place.
<p/>Then, too, a still more dreadful thing happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked in a place where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet were soaked in chemicals, and it was not long before they had eaten through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) new boots.
<p/>how was she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to know that they were all adulterated? ''  (<font color='red'><b>a poet</b></font>)</div>Then there was old Antanas. Then sores began to break out on his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) feet, and grow worse and worse.
<p/>Whether it was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) blood was bad, or there had been a cut, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) could not say; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) asked the men about it, and learned that it was a regular thing--it was the saltpeter.
<p/>Every one felt it, sooner or later, and then it was all up with him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), at least for that sort of work.
<p/>Yet old Antanas would not quit; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) saw the suffering of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) family, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) remembered what it had cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) to get a job.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) tied up his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) feet, and went on limping about and coughing, until at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) fell to pieces, all at once and in a heap, like the One-Horse Shay.
<p/>They carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Shay</b></font>) to a dry place and laid him (<font color='blue'><b>Shay</b></font>) on the floor, and that night two of the men helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Shay</b></font>) home.
<p/>The poor old man was put to bed, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tried it every morning until the end, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never could get up again.
<p/>The sores would never heal--in the end his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) toes would drop off, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not quit. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would lie there and cough and cough, day and night, wasting away to a mere skeleton.
<p/>There came a time when there was so little flesh on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that the bones began to poke through--which was a horrible thing to see or even to think of.
<p/>The family, wild with terror, sent for a doctor, and paid half a dollar to be told that there was nothing to be done.
<p/>Mercifully the doctor did not say this so that the old man could hear, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still clinging to the faith that tomorrow or next day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be better, and could go back to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) job.
<p/>The company had sent word to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that they would keep it for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--or rather Jurgis had bribed one of the men to come one Sunday afternoon and say they had.
<p/>Dede Antanas continued to believe it, while three more hemorrhages came; and then at last one morning they found him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) stiff and cold.
<p/>Things were not going well with them then, and though it nearly broke Teta Elzbieta's heart, they were forced to dispense with nearly all the decencies of a funeral; they had only a hearse, and one hack for the women and children; and Jurgis, who was learning things fast, spent all Sunday making a bargain for these, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) made it in the presence of witnesses, so that when the man tried to charge him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for all sorts of incidentals, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not have to pay.
<p/>For twenty-five years old Antanas Rudkus and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) son had dwelt in the forest together, and it was hard to part in this way
<p/>; perhaps it was just as well that Jurgis had to give all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attention to the task of having a funeral without being bankrupted, and so had no time to indulge in memories and grief.
<p/>And one night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a choking fit, and a little river of blood came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth. Now the dreadful winter was come upon them.
<p/>In the forests, all summer long, the branches of the trees do battle for light, and some of them lose and die; and then come the raging blasts, and the storms of snow and hail, and strew the ground with these weaker branches.
<p/>Just so it was in Packingtown; the whole district braced itself for the struggle that was an agony, and those whose time was come died off in hordes.
<p/>All the year round they had been serving as cogs in the great packing machine; and now was the time for the renovating of it, and the replacing of damaged parts.
<p/>There came pneumonia and grippe, stalking among them, seeking for weakened constitutions; there was the annual harvest of those whom tuberculosis had been dragging down.
<p/>Sooner or later came the day when the unfit one did not report for work; and then, with no time lost in waiting, and no inquiries or regrets, there was a chance for a new hand.
<p/>There came cruel, cold, and biting winds, and blizzards of snow, all testing relentlessly for failing muscles and impoverished blood. The new hands were here by the thousands.
<p/>All day long the gates of the packing houses were besieged by starving and penniless men; they came, literally, by the thousands every single morning, fighting with each other for a chance for life.
<p/>Blizzards and cold made no difference to them, they were always on hand; they were on hand two hours before the sun rose, an hour before the work began.
<p/>Sometimes their faces froze, sometimes their feet and their hands; sometimes they froze all together--but still they came, for they had no other place to go.
<p/>One day Durham advertised in the paper for two hundred men to cut ice; and all that day the homeless and starving of the city came trudging through the snow from all over its two hundred square miles.
<p/>That night forty score of them crowded into the station house of the stockyards district--they filled the rooms, sleeping in each other's laps, toboggan fashion, and they piled on top of each other in the corridors, till the police shut the doors and left some to freeze outside.
<p/>On the morrow, before daybreak, there were three thousand at Durham's, and the police reserves had to be sent for to quell the riot.
<p/>Then Durham's bosses picked out twenty of the biggest; the <div class="bookquote">``two hundred''  (<font color='red'><b>Durham bosses</b></font>)</div>proved to have been a printer's error. Four or five miles to the eastward lay the lake, and over this the bitter winds came raging.
<p/>Sometimes the thermometer would fall to ten or twenty degrees below zero at night, and in the morning the streets would be piled with snowdrifts up to the first-floor windows.
<p/>The streets through which our friends had to go to their work were all unpaved and full of deep holes and gullies; in summer, when it rained hard, a man might have to wade to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waist to get to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house; and now in winter it was no joke getting through these places, before light in the morning and after dark at night.
<p/>They would wrap up in all they owned, but they could not wrap up against exhaustion; and many a man gave out in these battles with the snowdrifts, and lay down and fell asleep.
<p/>Some would ride in the cars, if the cars were running; but when you are making only five cents an hour, as was little Stanislovas, you do not like to spend that much to ride two miles.
<p/>The children would come to the yards with great shawls about their ears, and so tied up that you could hardly find them--and still there would be accidents.
<p/>One bitter morning in February the little boy who worked at the lard machine with Stanislovas came about an hour late, and screaming with pain.
<p/>They unwrapped him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and a man began vigorously rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears; and as they were frozen stiff, it took only two or three rubs to break them short off.
<p/>And if it was bad for the men, one may imagine how the women and children fared. As a result of this, little Stanislovas conceived a terror of the cold that was almost a mania.
<p/>Nobody knew quite how to manage him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for threats did no good--it seemed to be something that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not control, and they feared sometimes that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go into convulsions.
<p/>In the end it had to be arranged that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always went with Jurgis, and came home with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again; and often, when the snow was deep, the man would carry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the whole way on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>Sometimes Jurgis would be working until late at night, and then it was pitiful, for there was no place for the little fellow to wait, save in the doorways or in a corner of the killing beds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would all but fall asleep there, and freeze to death.
<p/>There was no heat upon the killing beds; the men might exactly as well have worked out of doors all winter.
<p/>For that matter, there was very little heat anywhere in the building, except in the cooking rooms and such places--and it was the men who worked in these who ran the most risk of all, because whenever they had to pass to another room they had to go through ice-cold corridors, and sometimes with nothing on above the waist except a sleeveless undershirt.
<p/>On the killing beds you were apt to be covered with blood, and it would freeze solid; if you leaned against a pillar, you would freeze to that, and if you put your hand upon the blade of your knife, you would run a chance of leaving your skin on it.
<p/>The men would tie up their feet in newspapers and old sacks, and these would be soaked in blood and frozen, and then soaked again, and so on, until by nighttime a man would be walking on great lumps the size of the feet of an elephant.
<p/>Now and then, when the bosses were not looking, you would see them plunging their feet and ankles into the steaming hot carcass of the steer, or darting across the room to the hot-water jets.
<p/>The cruelest thing of all was that nearly all of them--all of those who used knives--were unable to wear gloves, and their arms would be white with frost and their hands would grow numb, and then of course there would be accidents.
<p/>Also the air would be full of steam, from the hot water and the hot blood, so that you could not see five feet before you; and then, with men rushing about at the speed they kept up on the killing beds, and all with butcher knives, like razors, in their hands--well, it was to be counted as a wonder that there were not more men slaughtered than cattle.
<p/>And yet all this inconvenience they might have put up with, if only it had not been for one thing--if only there had been some place where they might eat.
<p/>Jurgis had either to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) dinner amid the stench in which he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) had worked, or else to rush, as did all his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) companions, to any one of the hundreds of liquor stores which stretched out their arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>).
<p/>To the west of the yards ran Ashland Avenue, and here was an unbroken line of saloons--<div class="bookquote">``Whiskey Row,''  (<font color='red'><b>Street a dozen</b></font>)</div>they called it; to the north was Forty-seventh Street, where there were half a dozen to the block, and at the angle of the two was <div class="bookquote">``Whiskey Point,''  (<font color='red'><b>Street a dozen</b></font>)</div>a space of fifteen or twenty acres, and containing one glue factory and about two hundred saloons.
<p/>Every morning, when it came time to start for the yards, he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) would begin to cry and protest. One might walk among these and take his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) choice: ``Hot pea-soup and boiled cabbage today.
<p/>All of these things were printed in many languages, as were also the names of the resorts, which were infinite in their variety and appeal.
<p/>There was the <div class="bookquote">``Home Circle''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and the <div class="bookquote">``Cosey Corner'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>; there were <div class="bookquote">``Firesides''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Hearthstones''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Pleasure Palaces''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Wonderlands''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Dream Castles''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and ``Love's Delights.
<p/>Whatever else they were called, they were sure to be called <div class="bookquote">``Union Headquarters,''  (<font color='red'><b>workingmen</b></font>)</div>and to hold out a welcome to workingmen; and there was always a warm stove, and a chair near it, and some friends to laugh and talk with.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Sauerkraut and hot frankfurters. Walk in.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Bean soup and stewed lamb. Welcome. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' There was only one condition attached,--you must drink.
<p/>If you went in not intending to drink, you would be put out in no time, and if you were slow about going, like as not you would get your head split open with a beer bottle in the bargain.
<p/>But all of the men understood the convention and drank; they believed that by it they were getting something for nothing--for they did not need to take more than one drink, and upon the strength of it they might fill themselves up with a good hot dinner.
<p/>This did not always work out in practice, however, for there was pretty sure to be a friend who would treat you, and then you would have to treat him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went back he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not shiver so, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had more courage for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) task; the deadly brutalizing monotony of it did not afflict him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so,--he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had ideas while he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) worked, and took a more cheerful view of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) circumstances.
<p/>On the way home, however, the shivering was apt to come on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) again; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would have to stop once or twice to warm up against the cruel cold.
<p/>As there were hot things to eat in this saloon too, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might get home late to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) supper, or he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might not get home at all.
<p/>And then his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife might set out to look for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) too would feel the cold; and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have some of the children with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--and so a whole family would drift into drinking, as the current of a river drifts downstream.
<p/>As if to complete the chain, the packers all paid their men in checks, refusing all requests to pay in coin; and where in Packingtown could a man go to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) check cashed but to a saloon, where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could pay for the favor by spending a part of the money?
<p/>Then some one else would come in--and, anyhow, a few drinks were good for a man who worked hard. From all of these things Jurgis was saved because of Ona.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never would take but the one drink at noontime; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got the reputation of being a surly fellow, and was not quite welcome at the saloons, and had to drift about from one to another.
<p/>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got home perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have to trudge several blocks, and come staggering back through the snowdrifts with a bag of coal upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>Then at night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go straight home, helping Ona and Stanislovas, or often putting the former on a car. Home was not a very attractive place--at least not this winter.
<p/>They had only been able to buy one stove, and this was a small one, and proved not big enough to warm even the kitchen in the bitterest weather.
<p/>At night they would sit huddled round this stove, while they ate their supper off their laps; and then Jurgis and Jonas would smoke a pipe, after which they would all crawl into their beds to get warm, after putting out the fire to save the coal.
<p/>This made it hard for Teta Elzbieta all day, and for the children when they could not get to school. Then they would have some frightful experiences with the cold.
<p/>They would sleep with all their clothes on, including their overcoats, and put over them all the bedding and spare clothing they owned; the children would sleep all crowded into one bed, and yet even so they could not keep warm.
<p/>The outside ones would be shivering and sobbing, crawling over the others and trying to get down into the center, and causing a fight.
<p/>This old house with the leaky weatherboards was a very different thing from their cabins at home, with great thick walls plastered inside and outside with mud; and the cold which came upon them was a living thing, a demon-presence in the room.
<p/>They would waken in the midnight hours, when everything was black; perhaps they would hear it yelling outside, or perhaps there would be deathlike stillness--and that would be worse yet.
<p/>They could feel the cold as it crept in through the cracks, reaching out for them with its icy, death-dealing fingers; and they would crouch and cower, and try to hide from it, all in vain.
<p/>a grisly thing, a specter born in the black caverns of terror; a power primeval, cosmic, shadowing the tortures of the lost souls flung out to chaos and destruction.
<p/>It would come, and it would come; It was cruel iron-hard; and hour after hour they would cringe in its grasp, alone, alone.
<p/>And so on until morning--when they would go out to another day of toil, a little weaker, a little nearer to the time when it would be their turn to be shaken from the tree.
<p/>There would be no one to hear them if they cried out; there would be no help, no mercy. Chapter 8
<p/>Yet even by this deadly winter the germ of hope was not to be kept from sprouting in their hearts. It was just at this time that the great adventure befell Marija.
<p/>Everybody laughed at them, for Tamoszius was petite and frail, and Marija could have picked him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) up and carried him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) off under one arm.
<p/>The victim was Tamoszius Kuszleika, who played the violin. But perhaps that was why she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>); the sheer volume of Marija's energy was overwhelming.
<p/>That first night at the wedding Tamoszius had hardly taken his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) eyes off her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); and later on, when he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) came to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had really the heart of a baby, her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) voice and her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) violence ceased to terrify him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) got the habit of coming to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) visits on Sunday afternoons.
<p/>There was no place to entertain company except in the kitchen, in the midst of the family, and Tamoszius would sit there with his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) hat between his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) knees, never saying more than half a dozen words at a time, and turning red in the face before he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) managed to say those; until finally Jurgis would clap him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) upon the back, in his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) hearty way, crying, <div class="bookquote">``Come now, brother, give us a tune.
<p/>And then Tamoszius' face would light up and he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) would get out his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) fiddle, tuck it under his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) chin, and play.
<p/>And forthwith the soul of him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) would flame up and become eloquent--it was almost an impropriety, for all the while his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) gaze would be fixed upon Marija's face, until she (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would begin to turn red and lower her (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>There was no resisting the music of Tamoszius, however; even the children would sit awed and wondering, and the tears would run down Teta Elzbieta's cheeks.
<p/>A wonderful privilege it was to be thus admitted into the soul of a man of genius, to be allowed to share the ecstasies and the agonies of his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) inmost life.
<p/>People paid Tamoszius big money to come and make music on state occasions; and also they would invite him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) to parties and festivals, knowing well that he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) was too good-natured to come without his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) fiddle, and that having brought it, he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) could be made to play while others danced.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) made bold to ask Marija to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) to such a party, and Marija accepted, to his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) great delight--after which he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) never went anywhere without her (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>), while if the celebration were given by friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) would invite the rest of the family also.
<p/>In any case Marija would bring back a huge pocketful of cakes and sandwiches for the children, and stories of all the good things she (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) herself had managed to consume.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) was compelled, at these parties, to spend most of her (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) time at the refreshment table, for she (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) could not dance with anybody except other women and very old men; Tamoszius was of an excitable temperament, and afflicted with a frantic jealousy, and any unmarried man who ventured to put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm about the ample waist of Marija would be certain to throw the orchestra out of tune.
<p/>It was a great help to a person who had to toil all the week to be able to look forward to some such relaxation as this on Saturday nights.
<p/>The family was too poor and too hardworked to make many acquaintances; in Packingtown, as a rule, people know only their near neighbors and shopmates, and so the place is like a myriad of little country villages.
<p/>But now there was a member of the family who was permitted to travel and widen her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) horizon; and so each week there would be new personalities to talk about,--how
<p/>so-and-so was dressed, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) worked, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) got, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) was in love with; and how this man had jilted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) girl, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) had quarreled with the other girl, and what had passed between them; and how another man beat his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, and spent all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) earnings upon drink, and pawned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) very clothes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then there were other benefits accruing to Marija from this friendship--benefits of a more substantial nature. Some people would have scorned this talk as gossip; but then one has to talk about what one knows.
<p/>It was one Saturday night, as they were coming home from a wedding, that Tamoszius found courage, and set down his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) violin case in the street and spoke his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart; and then Marija clasped him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) told them all about it the next day, and fairly cried with happiness, for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said that Tamoszius was a lovely man.
<p/>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no longer made love to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fiddle, but they would sit for hours in the kitchen, blissfully happy in each other's arms; it was the tacit convention of the family to know nothing of what was going on in that corner.
<p/>They were planning to be married in the spring, and have the garret of the house fixed up, and live there.
<p/>Tamoszius made good wages; and little by little the family were paying back their debt to Marija, so she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ought soon to have enough to start life upon--only, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) preposterous softheartedness, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would insist upon spending a good part of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money every week for things which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) saw they needed.
<p/>Marija was really the capitalist of the party, for she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had become an expert can painter by this time--she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was getting fourteen cents for every hundred and ten cans, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could paint more than two cans every minute.
<p/>Marija felt, so to speak, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hand on the throttle, and the neighborhood was vocal with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rejoicings.
<p/>Yet her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) friends would shake their heads and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to go slow; one could not count upon such good fortune forever--there were accidents that always happened.
<p/>But Marija was not to be prevailed upon, and went on planning and dreaming of all the treasures she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was going to have for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) home; and so, when the crash did come, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) grief was painful to see.
<p/>Marija would about as soon have expected to see the sun shut down--the huge establishment had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a thing akin to the planets and the seasons.
<p/>And they had not given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) any explanation, they had not even given her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a day's warning; they had simply posted a notice one Saturday that all hands would be paid off that afternoon, and would not resume work for at least a month!
<p/>For her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) canning factory shut down! But now it was shut! And that was all that there was to it--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) job was gone!
<p/>It was the holiday rush that was over, the girls said in answer to Marija's inquiries; after that there was always a slack.
<p/>Sometimes the factory would start up on half time after a while, but there was no telling--it had been known to stay closed until way into the summer.
<p/>The prospects were bad at present, for truckmen who worked in the storerooms said that these were piled up to the ceilings, so that the firm could not have found room for another week's output of cans.
<p/>And they had turned off three-quarters of these men, which was a still worse sign, since it meant that there were no orders to be filled.
<p/>It was all a swindle, can-painting, said the girls--you were crazy with delight because you were making twelve or fourteen dollars a week, and saving half of it; but you had to spend it all keeping alive while you were out, and so your pay was really only half what you thought.
<p/>Marija came home, and because she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was a person who could not rest without danger of explosion, they first had a great house cleaning, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) set out to search Packingtown for a job to fill up the gap.
<p/>As nearly all the canning establishments were shut down, and all the girls hunting work, it will be readily understood that Marija did not find any.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) took to trying the stores and saloons, and when this failed she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) even traveled over into the far-distant regions near the lake front, where lived the rich people in great palaces, and begged there for some sort of work that could be done by a person who did not know English.
<p/>The men upon the killing beds felt also the effects of the slump which had turned Marija out; but they felt it in a different way, and a way which made Jurgis understand at last all their bitterness.
<p/>The big packers did not turn their hands off and close down, like the canning factories; but they began to run for shorter and shorter hours.
<p/>They had always required the men to be on the killing beds and ready for work at seven o'clock, although there was almost never any work to be done till the buyers out in the yards had gotten to work, and some cattle had come over the chutes.
<p/>That would often be ten or eleven o'clock, which was bad enough, in all conscience; but now, in the slack season, they would perhaps not have a thing for their men to do till late in the afternoon.
<p/>At first one would see them running about, or skylarking with each other, trying to keep warm; but before the day was over they would become quite chilled through and exhausted, and, when the cattle finally came, so near frozen that to move was an agony.
<p/>And so they would have to loaf around, in a place where the thermometer might be twenty degrees below zero! And then suddenly the place would spring into activity, and the merciless <div class="bookquote">``speeding-up''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>would begin!
<p/>There were weeks at a time when Jurgis went home after such a day as this with not more than two hours' work to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) credit--which meant about thirty-five cents.
<p/>There were many days when the total was less than half an hour, and others when there was none at all.
<p/>The general average was six hours a day, which meant for Jurgis about six dollars a week; and this six hours of work would be done after standing on the killing bed till one o'clock, or perhaps even three or four o'clock, in the afternoon.
<p/>Like as not there would come a rush of cattle at the very end of the day, which the men would have to dispose of before they went home, often working by electric light till nine or ten, or even twelve or one o'clock, and without a single instant for a bite of supper.
<p/>Perhaps the buyers would be holding off for better prices--if they could scare the shippers into thinking that they meant to buy nothing that day, they could get their own terms.
<p/>For some reason the cost of fodder for cattle in the yards was much above the market price--and you were not allowed to bring your own fodder!
<p/>Then, too, a number of cars were apt to arrive late in the day, now that the roads were blocked with snow, and the packers would buy their cattle that night, to get them cheaper, and then would come into play their ironclad rule, that all cattle must be killed the same day they were bought.
<p/>There was no use kicking about this--there had been one delegation after another to see the packers about it, only to be told that it was the rule, and that there was not the slightest chance of its ever being altered.
<p/>And so on Christmas Eve Jurgis worked till nearly one o'clock in the morning, and on Christmas Day he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was on the killing bed at seven o'clock.
<p/>The men were at the mercy of the cattle. All this was bad; and yet it was not the worst. For after all the hard work a man did, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was paid for only part of it.
<p/>Jurgis had once been among those who scoffed at the idea of these huge concerns cheating; and so now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could appreciate the bitter irony of the fact that it was precisely their size which enabled them to do it with impunity.
<p/>One of the rules on the killing beds was that a man who was one minute late was docked an hour; and this was economical, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was made to work the balance of the hour--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not allowed to stand round and wait.
<p/>And on the other hand if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came ahead of time he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got no pay for that--though often the bosses would start up the gang ten or fifteen minutes before the whistle.
<p/>And this same custom they carried over to the end of the day; they did not pay for any fraction of an hour--for ``broken time.
<p/>A man might work full fifty minutes, but if there was no work to fill out the hour, there was no pay for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Thus the end of every day was a sort of lottery--a struggle, all but breaking into open war between the bosses and the men, the former trying to rush a job through and the latter trying to stretch it out.
<p/>Jurgis blamed the bosses for this, though the truth to be told it was not always their fault; for the packers kept them frightened for their lives--and when one was in danger of falling behind the standard, what was easier than to catch up by making the gang work awhile <div class="bookquote">``for the church'' (<font color='red'><b>gang</b></font>)</div>?
<p/>Old man Jones was great on missions and such things, and so whenever they were doing some particularly disreputable job, the men would wink at each other and say, <div class="bookquote">``Now we're working for the church!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the consequences of all these things was that Jurgis was no longer perplexed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) heard men talk of fighting for their rights.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) felt like fighting now himself; and when the Irish delegate of the butcher-helpers' union came to him (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) a second time, he (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) received him (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) in a far different spirit.
<p/>A wonderful idea it now seemed to Jurgis, this of the men--that by combining they might be able to make a stand and conquer the packers!
<p/>Jurgis wondered who had first thought of it; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) was told that it was a common thing for men to do in America, he (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) got the first inkling of a meaning in the phrase <div class="bookquote">``a free country.
<p/>The delegate explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) how it depended upon their being able to get every man to join and stand by the organization, and so Jurgis signified that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was willing to do his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) share.
<p/>Before another month was by, all the working members of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family had union cards, and wore their union buttons conspicuously and with pride.
<p/>For fully a week they were quite blissfully happy, thinking that belonging to a union meant an end to all their troubles.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This was a savage witticism the men had, which Jurgis had to have explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' But only ten days after she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had joined, Marija's canning factory closed down, and that blow quite staggered them.
<p/>They could not understand why the union had not prevented it, and the very first time she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attended a meeting Marija got up and made a speech about it.
<p/>It was a business meeting, and was transacted in English, but that made no difference to Marija; she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said what was in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and all the pounding of the chairman's gavel and all the uproar and confusion in the room could not prevail.
<p/>Quite apart from her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own troubles she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was boiling over with a general sense of the injustice of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told what she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of the packers, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of a world where such things were allowed to happen; and then, while the echoes of the hall rang with the shock of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) terrible voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down again and fanned herself, and the meeting gathered itself together and proceeded to discuss the election of a recording secretary.
<p/>Jurgis too had an adventure the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) attended a union meeting, but it was not of his (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) own seeking.
<p/>Jurgis had gone with the desire to get into an inconspicuous corner and see what was done; but this attitude of silent and open-eyed attention had marked him (<font color='blue'><b>secretary</b></font>) out for a victim.
<p/>Tommy Finnegan was a little Irishman, with big staring eyes and a wild aspect, a <div class="bookquote">``hoister''  (<font color='red'><b>Finnegan a Irishman hoister</b></font>)</div>by trade, and badly cracked.
<p/>Somewhere back in the far-distant past Tommy Finnegan had had a strange experience, and the burden of it rested upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) talked he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) victim by the buttonhole, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) face kept coming closer and closer--which was trying, because his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) teeth were so bad.
<p/>All the balance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) life he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) had done nothing but try to make it understood. Jurgis did not mind that, only he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) was frightened.
<p/>The method of operation of the higher intelligences was Tom Finnegan's theme, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) desired to find out if Jurgis had ever considered that the representation of things in their present similarity might be altogether unintelligible upon a more elevated plane.
<p/>There were assuredly wonderful mysteries about the developing of these things; and then, becoming confidential, Mr. Finnegan proceeded to tell of some discoveries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) own.
<p/>If ye have iver had onything to do wid shperrits,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>), and looked inquiringly at Jurgis, who kept shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' '' Niver mind, niver mind,'' continued the other, <div class="bookquote">``but their influences may be operatin' upon ye; it's shure as I'm tellin'
<p/>It was vouchsafed to me in me youthful days to be acquainted with shperrits''  (<font color='red'><b>Tommy Finnegan</b></font>)</div>and so Tommy Finnegan went on, expounding a system of philosophy,
<p/>ye, it's them that has the reference to the immejit surroundin 's that has the most of power. while the perspiration came out on Jurgis' forehead, so great was his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) agitation and embarrassment.
<p/>In the end one of the men, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) plight, came over and rescued him (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>); but it was some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) was able to find any one to explain things to him (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>), and meanwhile his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) fear lest the strange little Irishman should get him (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) cornered again
<p/>was enough to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) dodging about the room the whole evening. He (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) never missed a meeting, however. He (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) had picked up a few words of English by this time, and friends would help him (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) to understand.
<p/>They were often very turbulent meetings, with half a dozen men declaiming at once, in as many dialects of English; but the speakers were all desperately in earnest, and Jurgis was in earnest too, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) understood that a fight was on, and that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) fight.
<p/>Since the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Finnegan</b></font>) disillusionment, Jurgis had sworn to trust no man, except in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own family; but here he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discovered that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had brothers in affliction, and allies.
<p/>Jurgis had always been a member of the church, because it was the right thing to be, but the church had never touched him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) left all that for the women.
<p/>Here, however, was a new religion--one that did touch him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>), that took hold of every fiber of him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>); and with all the zeal and fury of a convert he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) went out as a missionary.
<p/>There were many nonunion men among the Lithuanians, and with these he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) would labor and wrestle in prayer, trying to show them the right.
<p/>Their one chance for life was in union, and so the struggle became a kind of crusade. Sometimes they would be obstinate and refuse to see it, and Jurgis, alas, was not always patient!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) forgot how he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) himself had been blind, a short time ago--after the fashion of all crusaders since the original ones, who set out to spread the gospel of Brotherhood by force of arms.
<p/>Chapter 9 One of the first consequences of the discovery of the union was that Jurgis became desirous of learning English.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) wanted to know what was going on at the meetings, and to be able to take part in them, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) began to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>), and to try to pick up words.
<p/>The children, who were at school, and learning fast, would teach him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) a few; and a friend loaned him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a little book that had some in it, and Ona would read them to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>Then Jurgis became sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not read himself; and later on in the winter, when some one told him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that there was a night school that was free, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went and enrolled.
<p/>After that, every evening that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got home from the yards in time, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would go to the school; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would go even if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) were in time for only half an hour.
<p/>They were teaching him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) both to read and to speak English--and they would have taught him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) other things, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had had a little time.
<p/>Also the union made another great difference with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--it made him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) begin to pay attention to the country. It was the beginning of democracy with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).
<p/>It was a little state, the union, a miniature republic; its affairs were every man's affairs, and every man had a real say about them.
<p/>In the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come from there had not been any politics--in Russia one thought of the government as an affliction like the lightning and the hail.
<p/>In other words, in the union Jurgis learned to talk politics. '' Duck, little brother, duck,'' the wise old peasants would whisper; <div class="bookquote">``everything passes away.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the peasants</b></font>)</div>And when Jurgis had first come to America he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had supposed that it was the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had heard people say that it was a free country--but what did that mean?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) found that here, precisely as in Russia, there were rich men who owned everything; and if one could not find any work, was not the hunger he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) began to feel the same sort of hunger?
<p/>When Jurgis had been working about three weeks at Brown's, there had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) one noontime a man who was employed as a night watchman, and who asked him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) would not like to take out naturalization papers and become a citizen.
<p/>In the first place, it would not cost him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) anything, and it would get him (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) half a day off, with his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) pay just the same; and then when election time came he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) would be able to vote--and there was something in that.
<p/>Jurgis was naturally glad to accept, and so the night watchman said a few words to the boss, and he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) was excused for the rest of the day.
<p/>When, later on, he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) wanted a holiday to get married he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) could not get it; and as for a holiday with pay just the same--what power had wrought that miracle heaven only knew!
<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) went with the man, who picked up several other newly landed immigrants, Poles, Lithuanians, and Slovaks, and took them all outside, where stood a great four-horse tallyho coach, with fifteen or twenty men already in it.
<p/>It was a fine chance to see the sights of the city, and the party had a merry time, with plenty of beer handed up from inside.
<p/>So they drove downtown and stopped before an imposing granite building, in which they interviewed an official, who had the papers all ready, with only the names to be filled in.
<p/>So each man in turn took an oath of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not understand a word, and then was presented with a handsome ornamented document with a big red seal and the shield of the United States upon it, and was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become a citizen of the Republic and the equal of the President himself.
<p/>A month or two later Jurgis had another interview with this same man, who told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) where to go to <div class="bookquote">``register.
<p/>And then finally, when election day came, the packing houses posted a notice that men who desired to vote might remain away until nine that morning, and the same night watchman took Jurgis and the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>watchman</b></font>) flock into the back room of a saloon, and showed each of them where and how to mark a ballot, and then gave each two dollars, and took them to the polling place, where there was a policeman on duty especially to see that they got through all right.
<p/>Jurgis felt quite proud of this good luck till he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) got home and met Jonas, who had taken the leader aside and whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>), offering to vote three times for four dollars, which offer had been accepted.
<p/>And now in the union Jurgis met men who explained all this mystery to him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) learned that America differed from Russia in that its government existed under the form of a democracy.
<p/>The officials who ruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there were two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the one got the office which bought the most votes.
<p/>Jurgis did not know what that meant, but the man explained the advantages. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Now and then, the election was very close, and that was the time the poor man came in.
<p/>In the stockyards this was only in national and state elections, for in local elections the Democratic Party always carried everything.
<p/>Scully held an important party office in the state, and bossed even the mayor of the city, it was said; it was his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) boast that he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) carried the stockyards in his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>The ruler of the district was therefore the Democratic boss, a little Irishman named Mike Scully. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) was an enormously rich man--he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) had a hand in all the big graft in the neighborhood.
<p/>It was Scully, for instance, who owned that dump which Jurgis and Ona had seen the first day of their arrival.
<p/>Not only did he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) own the dump, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) owned the brick factory as well, and first he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) took out the clay and made it into bricks, and
<p/>then he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had the city bring garbage to fill up the hole, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) could build houses to sell to the people.
<p/>Then, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) sold the bricks to the city, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) own price, and the city came and got them in its own wagons.
<p/>And also he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) owned the other hole near by, where the stagnant water was; and it was he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) who cut the ice and sold it; and what was more, if the men told truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had not had to pay any taxes for the water, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had built the ice-house out of city lumber, and had not had to pay anything for that.
<p/>The newspapers had got hold of that story, and there had been a scandal; but Scully had hired somebody to confess and take all the blame, and then skip the country.
<p/>It was said, too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had built his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) brick-kiln in the same way, and that the workmen were on the city payroll while they did it; however, one had to press closely to get these things out of the men, for it was not their business, and Mike Scully was a good man to stand in with.
<p/>A note signed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was equal to a job any time at the packing houses; and also he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) employed a good many men himself, and worked them only eight hours a day, and paid them the highest wages.
<p/>This gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) many friends--all of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had gotten together into the <div class="bookquote">``War Whoop League,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>whose clubhouse you might see just outside of the yards.
<p/>It was the biggest clubhouse, and the biggest club, in all Chicago; and they had prizefights every now and then, and cockfights and even dogfights.
<p/>The policemen in the district all belonged to the league, and instead of suppressing the fights, they sold tickets for them.
<p/>The man that had taken Jurgis to be naturalized was one of these <div class="bookquote">``Indians,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>as they were called; and on election day there would be hundreds of them out, and all with big wads of money in their pockets and free drinks at every saloon in the district.
<p/>That was another thing, the men said--all the saloon-keepers had to be <div class="bookquote">``Indians,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>and to put up on demand, otherwise they could not do business on Sundays, nor have any gambling at all.
<p/>In the same way Scully had all the jobs in the fire department at his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) disposal, and all the rest of the city graft in the stockyards district; he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was building a block of flats somewhere up on Ashland Avenue, and the man who was overseeing it for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was drawing pay as a city inspector of sewers.
<p/>The city inspector of water pipes had been dead and buried for over a year, but somebody was still drawing his (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) pay.
<p/>The city inspector of sidewalks was a barkeeper at the War Whoop Cafe--and maybe he (<font color='blue'><b>inspector</b></font>) could make it uncomfortable for any tradesman who did not stand in with Scully!
<p/>It gave them pleasure to believe this, for Scully stood as the people's man, and boasted of it boldly when election day came.
<p/>The packers had wanted a bridge at Ashland Avenue, but they had not been able to get it till they had seen Scully; and it was the same with <div class="bookquote">``Bubbly Creek,''  (<font color='red'><b>Scully/Mike Scully</b></font>)</div>which the city had threatened to make the packers cover over, till Scully had come to their aid.
<p/>Bubbly Creek'' is an arm of the Chicago River, and forms the southern boundary of the yards: all the drainage of the square mile of packing houses empties into it, so that it is really a great open sewer a hundred or two feet wide.
<p/>Even the packers were in awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>), so the men said. '' One long arm of it is blind, and the filth stays there forever and a day.
<p/>The grease and chemicals that are poured into it undergo all sorts of strange transformations, which are the cause of its name; it is constantly in motion, as if huge fish were feeding in it, or great leviathans disporting themselves in its depths.
<p/>Here and there the grease and filth have caked solid, and the creek looks like a bed of lava; chickens walk about on it, feeding, and many times an unwary stranger has started to stroll across, and vanished temporarily.
<p/>Bubbles of carbonic acid gas will rise to the surface and burst, and make rings two or three feet wide. The packers used to leave the creek that way, till every now
<p/>and then the surface would catch on fire and burn furiously, and the fire department would have to come and put it out.
<p/>Once, however, an ingenious stranger came and started to gather this filth in scows, to make lard out of; then the packers took the cue, and got out an injunction to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), and afterward gathered it themselves.
<p/>The banks of <div class="bookquote">``Bubbly Creek''  (<font color='red'><b>the packers</b></font>)</div>are plastered thick with hairs, and this also the packers gather and clean. And there were things even stranger than this, according to the gossip of the men.
<p/>The newspapers had been full of this scandal--once there had even been an investigation, and an actual uncovering of the pipes; but nobody had been punished, and the thing went right on.
<p/>The packers had secret mains, through which they stole billions of gallons of the city's water. And then there was the condemned meat industry, with its endless horrors.
<p/>The people of Chicago saw the government inspectors in Packingtown, and they all took that to mean that they were protected from diseased meat; they did not understand that these hundred and sixty-three inspectors had been appointed at the request of the packers, and that they were paid by the United States government to certify that all the diseased meat was kept in the state.
<p/>They had no authority beyond that; for the inspection of meat to be sold in the city and state the whole force in Packingtown consisted of three henchmen of the local political machine!
<p/>* -LRB-*Rules and Regulations for the Inspection of Livestock and Their Products. United States Department of Agriculture, Bureau of Animal Industries,
<p/>Proprietors of slaughterhouses, canning, salting, packing, or rendering establishments engaged in the slaughtering of cattle, sheep, or swine, or the packing of any of their products, the carcasses or products of which are to become subjects of interstate or foreign commerce, shall make application to the Secretary of Agriculture for inspection of said animals and their products....
<p/>Such rejected or condemned animals shall at once be removed by the owners from the pens containing animals which have been inspected and found to be free from disease and fit for human food, and shall be disposed of in accordance with the laws, ordinances, and regulations of the state and municipality in which said rejected or condemned animals are located....

<p/>No microscopic examination will be made of hogs slaughtered for interstate trade, but this examination shall be confined to those intended for the export trade.-RRB-
<p/>And shortly afterward one of these, a physician, made the discovery that the carcasses of steers which had been condemned as tubercular by the government inspectors, and which therefore contained ptomaines, which are deadly poisons, were left upon an open platform and carted away to be sold in the city; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) insisted that these carcasses be treated with an injection of kerosene--and was ordered to resign the same week!
<p/>So indignant were the packers that they went farther, and compelled the mayor to abolish the whole bureau of inspection; so that since then there has not been even a pretense of any interference with the graft.
<p/>There was said to be two thousand dollars a week hush money from the tubercular steers alone; and as much again from the hogs which had died of cholera on the trains, and which you might see any day being loaded into boxcars and hauled away to a place called Globe, in Indiana, where they made a fancy grade of lard.
<p/>It seemed as if every time you met a person from a new department, you heard of new swindles and new crimes.
<p/>There was, for instance, a Lithuanian who was a cattle butcher for the plant where Marija had worked, which killed meat for canning only; and to hear this man describe the animals which came to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place would have been worthwhile for a Dante or a Zola.
<p/>It seemed that they must have agencies all over the country, to hunt out old and crippled and diseased cattle to be canned.
<p/>There were cattle which had been fed on <div class="bookquote">``whisky-malt,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>the refuse of the breweries, and had become what the men called <div class="bookquote">``steerly'' (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>--which means covered with boils.
<p/>It was a nasty job killing these, for when you plunged your knife into them they would burst and splash foul-smelling stuff into your face; and when a man's sleeves were smeared with blood, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands steeped in it, how was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever to wipe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, or to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see?
<p/>It was stuff such as this that made the <div class="bookquote">``embalmed beef''  (<font color='red'><b>United</b></font>)</div>that had killed several times as many United States soldiers as all the bullets of the Spaniards; only the army beef, besides, was not fresh canned, it was old stuff that had been lying for years in the cellars.
<p/>Then one Sunday evening, Jurgis sat puffing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pipe by the kitchen stove, and talking with an old fellow whom Jonas had introduced, and who worked in the canning rooms at Durham's; and so Jurgis learned a few things about the great and only Durham canned goods, which had become a national institution.
<p/>They were regular alchemists at Durham's; they advertised a mushroom-catsup, and the men who made it did not know what a mushroom looked like.
<p/>Jurgis heard of these things little by little, in the gossip of those who were obliged to perpetrate them. They advertised <div class="bookquote">``potted chicken,'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--and
<p/>Perhaps they had a secret process for making chickens chemically--who knows? said Jurgis' friend; the things that went into the mixture were tripe, and the fat of pork, and beef suet, and hearts of beef, and finally the waste ends of veal, when they had any.
<p/>They put these up in several grades, and sold them at several prices; but the contents of the cans all came out of the same hopper.
<p/>it was like the boardinghouse soup of the comic papers, through which a chicken had walked with rubbers on. And then there was <div class="bookquote">``potted game''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``potted grouse,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``potted ham,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``deviled ham'' (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>--de-vyled, as the men called it. ''
<p/>De-vyled'' ham was made out of the waste ends of smoked beef that were too small to be sliced by the machines; and also tripe, dyed with chemicals so that it would not show white; and trimmings of hams and corned beef; and potatoes, skins and all; and finally the hard cartilaginous gullets of beef, after the tongues had been cut out.
<p/>Anybody who could invent a new imitation had been sure of a fortune from old Durham, said Jurgis' informant; but it was hard to think of anything new in a place where so many sharp wits had been at work for so long; where men welcomed tuberculosis in the cattle they were feeding, because it made them fatten more quickly; and where they bought up all the old rancid butter left over in the grocery stores of a continent, and <div class="bookquote">``oxidized''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>it by a forced-air process, to take away the odor, rechurned it with skim milk, and sold it in bricks in the cities!
<p/>a year or two ago it had been the custom to kill horses in the yards--ostensibly for fertilizer; but after long agitation the newspapers had been able to make the public realize that the horses were being canned.
<p/>Now it was against the law to kill horses in Packingtown, and the law was really complied with--for the present, at any rate.
<p/>Any day, however, one might see sharp-horned and shaggy-haired creatures running with the sheep and yet what a job you would have to get the public to believe that a good part of what it buys for lamb and mutton is really goat's flesh!
<p/>There was another interesting set of statistics that a person might have gathered in Packingtown--those of the various afflictions of the workers.
<p/>When Jurgis had first inspected the packing plants with Szedvilas, he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) had marveled while he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) listened to the tale of all the things that were made out of the carcasses of animals, and of all the lesser industries that were maintained there; now he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) found that each one of these lesser industries was a separate little inferno, in its way as horrible as the killing beds, the source and fountain of them all.
<p/>All this ingenious mixture was ground up and flavored with spices to make it taste like something. Up to The workers in each of them had their own peculiar diseases.
<p/>And the wandering visitor might be skeptical about all the swindles, but he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) could not be skeptical about these, for the worker bore the evidence of them about on his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) own person--generally he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) had only to hold out his (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) hand.
<p/>There were the men in the pickle rooms, for instance, where old Antanas had gotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) death; scarce a one of these that had not some spot of horror on his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) person.
<p/>Let a man so much as scrape his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) finger pushing a truck in the pickle rooms, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) might have a sore that would put him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) out of the world; all the joints in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) fingers might be eaten by the acid, one by one.
<p/>Of the butchers and floorsmen, the beef-boners and trimmers, and all those who used knives, you could scarcely find a person who had the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) thumb; time and time again the base of it had been slashed, till it was a mere lump of flesh against which the man pressed the knife to hold it.
<p/>The hands of these men would be criss-crossed with cuts, until you could no longer pretend to count them or to trace them.
<p/>They would have no nails,--they had worn them off pulling hides; their knuckles were swollen so that their fingers spread out like a fan.
<p/>There were men who worked in the cooking rooms, in the midst of steam and sickening odors, by artificial light; in these rooms the germs of tuberculosis might live for two years, but the supply was renewed every hour.
<p/>There were the beef-luggers, who carried two-hundred-pound quarters into the refrigerator-cars; a fearful kind of work, that began at four o'clock in the morning, and that wore out the most powerful men in a few years.
<p/>There were those who worked in the chilling rooms, and whose special disease was rheumatism; the time limit that a man could work in the chilling rooms was said to be five years.
<p/>There were the wool-pluckers, whose hands went to pieces even sooner than the hands of the pickle men; for the pelts of the sheep had to be painted with acid to loosen the wool, and then the pluckers had to pull out this wool with their bare hands, till the acid had eaten their fingers off.
<p/>There were those who made the tins for the canned meat; and their hands, too, were a maze of cuts, and each cut represented a chance for blood poisoning.
<p/>Some worked at the stamping machines, and it was very seldom that one could work long there at the pace that was set, and not give out and forget himself and have a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hand chopped off.
<p/>There were the <div class="bookquote">``hoisters,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as they were called, whose task it was to press the lever which lifted the dead cattle off the floor.
<p/>They ran along upon a rafter, peering down through the damp and the steam; and as old Durham's architects had not built the killing room for the convenience of the hoisters, at every few feet they would have to stoop under a beam, say four feet above the one they ran on; which got them into the habit of stooping, so that in a few years they would be walking like chimpanzees.
<p/>Worst of any, however, were the fertilizer men, and those who served in the cooking rooms. These people could not be shown to the visitor,--for
<p/>the odor of a fertilizer man would scare any ordinary visitor at a hundred yards, and as for the other men, who worked in tank rooms full of steam, and in some of which there were open vats near the level of the floor, their peculiar trouble was that they fell into the vats; and when they were fished out, there was never enough of them left to be worth exhibiting,--sometimes they would be overlooked for days, till all but the bones of them had gone out to the world as Durham's Pure Leaf Lard!
<p/>During the early part of the winter the family had had money enough to live and a little over to pay their debts with; but when the earnings of Jurgis fell from nine or ten dollars a week to five or six, there was no longer anything to spare.
<p/>The winter went, and the spring came, and found them still living thus from hand to mouth, hanging on day by day, with literally not a month's wages between them and starvation.
<p/>Marija was in despair, for there was still no word about the reopening of the canning factory, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) savings were almost entirely gone.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) had had to give up all idea of marrying then; the family could not get along without her (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>)--though for that matter she (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) was likely soon to become a burden even upon them, for when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) money was all gone, they would have to pay back what they owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) in board.
<p/>So Jurgis and Ona and Teta Elzbieta would hold anxious conferences until late at night, trying to figure how they could manage this too without starving.
<p/>Such were the cruel terms upon which their life was possible, that they might never have nor expect a single instant's respite from worry, a single instant in which they were not haunted by the thought of money.
<p/>Chapter 10 They would no sooner escape, as by a miracle, from one difficulty, than a new one would come into view.
<p/>In addition to all their physical hardships, there was thus a constant strain upon their minds; they were harried all day and nearly all night by worry and fear.
<p/>This was in truth not living; it was scarcely even existing, and they felt that it was too little for the price they paid.
<p/>They were willing to work all the time; and when people did their best, ought they not to be able to keep alive?
<p/>Once their water pipes froze and burst; and when, in their ignorance, they thawed them out, they had a terrifying flood in their house.
<p/>It happened while the men were away, and poor Elzbieta rushed out into the street screaming for help, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) did not even know whether the flood could be stopped, or whether they were ruined for life.
<p/>It was nearly as bad as the latter, they found in the end, for the plumber charged them seventy-five cents an hour, and seventy-five cents for another man who had stood and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and included all the time the two had been going and coming, and also a charge for all sorts of material and extras.
<p/>And then again, when they went to pay their January's installment on the house, the agent terrified them by asking them if they had had the insurance attended to yet.
<p/>In answer to their inquiry he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) showed them a clause in the deed which provided that they were to keep the house insured for one thousand dollars, as soon as the present policy ran out, which would happen in a few days.
<p/>There seemed never to be an end to the things they had to buy and to the unforeseen contingencies. Poor Elzbieta, upon whom again fell the blow, demanded how much it would cost them.
<p/>Seven dollars, the man said; and that night came Jurgis, grim and determined, requesting that the agent would be good enough to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>), once for all, as to all the expenses they were liable for.
<p/>The deed was signed now, he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) said, with sarcasm proper to the new way of life he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had learned--the deed was signed, and so the agent had no longer anything to gain by keeping quiet.
<p/>And Jurgis looked the fellow squarely in the eye, and so the fellow wasted no time in conventional protests, but read him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) the deed.
<p/>They would have to renew the insurance every year; they would have to pay the taxes, about ten dollars a year; they would have to pay the water tax, about six dollars a year---LRB-Jurgis silently resolved to shut off the hydrant-RRB-.
<p/>This, besides the interest and the monthly installments, would be all--unless by chance the city should happen to decide to put in a sewer or to lay a sidewalk.
<p/>Yes, said the agent, they would have to have these, whether they wanted them or not, if the city said so.
<p/>The sewer would cost them about twenty-two dollars, and the sidewalk fifteen if it were wood, twenty-five if it were cement.
<p/>So Jurgis went home again; it was a relief to know the worst, at any rate, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) could no more be surprised by fresh demands.
<p/>They could only go on and make the fight and win--for defeat was a thing that could not even be thought of.
<p/>When the springtime came, they were delivered from the dreadful cold, and that was a great deal; but in addition they had counted on the money they would not have to pay for coal--and it was just at this time that Marija's board began to fail.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) saw now how they had been plundered; but they were in for it, there was no turning back. Then, too, the warm weather brought trials of its own; each season had its trials, as they found.
<p/>In the spring there were cold rains, that turned the streets into canals and bogs; the mud would be so deep that wagons would sink up to the hubs, so that half a dozen horses could not move them.
<p/>Then, of course, it was impossible for any one to get to work with dry feet; and this was bad for men that were poorly clad and shod, and still worse for women and children.
<p/>Later came midsummer, with the stifling heat, when the dingy killing beds of Durham's became a very purgatory; one time, in a single day, three men fell dead from sunstroke.
<p/>All day long the rivers of hot blood poured forth, until, with the sun beating down, and the air motionless, the stench was enough to knock a man over; all the old smells of a generation would be drawn out by this heat--for there was never any washing of the walls and rafters and pillars, and they were caked with the filth of a lifetime.
<p/>The men who worked on the killing beds would come to reek with foulness, so that you could smell one of them fifty feet away; there was simply no such thing as keeping decent, the most careful man gave it up in the end, and wallowed in uncleanness.
<p/>There was not even a place where a man could wash his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and the men ate as much raw blood as food at dinnertime.
<p/>When they were at work they could not even wipe off their faces--they were as helpless as newly born babes in that respect; and it may seem like a small matter, but when the sweat began to run down their necks and tickle them, or a fly to bother them, it was a torture like being burned alive.
<p/>Whether it was the slaughterhouses or the dumps that were responsible, one could not say, but with the hot weather there descended upon Packingtown a veritable Egyptian plague of flies; there could be no describing this--the houses would be black with them.
<p/>There was no escaping; you might provide all your doors and windows with screens, but their buzzing outside would be like the swarming of bees, and whenever you opened the door they would rush in as if a storm of wind were driving them.
<p/>Perhaps the summertime suggests to you thoughts of the country, visions of green fields and mountains and sparkling lakes. It had no such suggestion for the people in the yards.
<p/>The great packing machine ground on remorselessly, without thinking of green fields; and the men and women and children who were part of it never saw any green thing, not even a flower.
<p/>Four or five miles to the east of them lay the blue waters of Lake Michigan; but for all the good
<p/>it did them it might have been as far away as the Pacific Ocean. They had only Sundays, and then they were too tired to walk.
<p/>The managers and superintendents and clerks of Packingtown were all recruited from another class, and never from the workers; they scorned the workers, the very meanest of them.
<p/>A poor devil of a bookkeeper who had been working in Durham's for twenty years at a salary of six dollars a week, and might work there for twenty more and do no better, would yet consider himself a gentleman, as far removed as the poles from the most skilled worker on the killing beds; he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) would dress differently, and live in another part of the town, and come to work at a different hour of the day, and in every way make sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>worker</b></font>) never rubbed elbows with a laboring man.
<p/>Perhaps this was due to the repulsiveness of the work; at any rate, the people who worked with their hands were a class apart, and were made to feel it.
<p/>In the late spring the canning factory started up again, and so once more Marija was heard to sing, and the love-music of Tamoszius took on a less melancholy tone.
<p/>They were tied to the great packing machine, and tied to it for life. It was not for long, however; for a month or two later a dreadful calamity fell upon Marija.
<p/>Just one year and three days after she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) had begun work as a can-painter, she (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) job. It was a long story.
<p/>The packers, of course, had spies in all the unions, and in addition they made a practice of buying up a certain number of the union officials, as many as they thought they needed.
<p/>So every week they received reports as to what was going on, and often they knew things before the members of the union knew them.
<p/>Any one who was considered to be dangerous by them would find that he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) was not a favorite with his (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) boss; and Marija had been a great hand for going after the foreign people and preaching to them.
<p/>However that might be, the known facts were that a few weeks before the factory closed, Marija had been cheated out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) pay for three hundred cans.
<p/>Marija insisted that it was because of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marija</b></font>) activity in the union. The girls worked at a long table, of the number they finished.
<p/>This woman was, of course, only human, and sometimes made mistakes; when this happened, there was no redress-- if on Saturday you got less money than you had earned, you had to make the best of it.
<p/>Marija's disturbances did not mean anything, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had known only Lithuanian and Polish, they had done no harm, for people only laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cry.
<p/>But now Marija was able to call names in English, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got the woman who made the mistake to disliking her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Probably, as Marija claimed, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made mistakes on purpose after that; at any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made them, and the third time it happened Marija went on the warpath and took the matter first to the forelady, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got no satisfaction there, to the superintendent.
<p/>This was unheard-of presumption, but the superintendent said he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) would see about it, which Marija took to mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was going to get her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) money; after waiting three days, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went to see the superintendent again.
<p/>This time the man frowned, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not had time to attend to it; and when Marija, against the advice and warning of every one, tried it once more, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work in a passion.
<p/>Just how things happened after that Marija was not sure, but that afternoon the forelady told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) services would not be any longer required.
<p/>Poor Marija could not have been more dumfounded had the woman knocked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) over the head; at first she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not believe what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grew furious and swore that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would come anyway, that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) place belonged to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>But Marija did not understand this, and made a disturbance. In the end she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat down in the middle of the floor and wept and wailed.
<p/>The next time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) place, as the forelady expressed it; and so Marija went out, and the family faced the problem of an existence again.
<p/>It was especially hard this time, for Ona was to be confined before long, and Jurgis was trying hard to save up money for this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had heard dreadful stories of the midwives, who grow as thick as fleas in Packingtown; and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind that Ona must have a man-doctor.
<p/>Jurgis could be very obstinate when he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wanted to, and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was in this case, much to the dismay of the women, who felt that a man-doctor was an impropriety, and that the matter really belonged to them.
<p/>The cheapest doctor they could find would charge them fifteen dollars, and perhaps more when the bill came in; and here was Jurgis, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would pay it, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had to stop eating in the meantime!
<p/>It was a cruel lesson; but then Marija was headstrong --she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should have listened to those who had had experience. Marija had only about twenty-five dollars left.
<p/>Marija could do the work of an able-bodied man, when she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was cheerful, but discouragement wore her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) out easily, and she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would come home at night a pitiable object.
<p/>Day after day she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wandered about the yards begging a job, but this time without hope of finding it. She (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) learned her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lesson this time, poor creature; she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) learned it ten times over.
<p/>All the family learned it along with her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)--that when you have once got a job in Packingtown, you hang on to it, come what will.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lost all interest in the union, and cursed herself for a fool that she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had ever been dragged into one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had about made up her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a lost soul, when somebody told her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) of an opening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went and got a place as a <div class="bookquote">``beef-trimmer.
<p/>Four weeks Marija hunted, and half of a fifth week. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stopped paying her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) dues to the union. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) got this because the boss saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had the muscles of a man, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) discharged a man and put Marija to do his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, paying her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a little more than half what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been paying before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was in another canning factory, and her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) work was to trim the meat of those diseased cattle that Jurgis had been told about not long before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was shut up in one of the rooms where the people seldom saw the daylight; beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) were the chilling rooms, where the meat was frozen, and above her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
<p/>were the cooking rooms; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stood on an ice-cold floor, while her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head was often so hot that she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could scarcely breathe.
<p/>Trimming beef off the bones by the hundred-weight, while standing up from early morning till late at night, with heavy boots on and the floor always damp and full of puddles, liable to be thrown out of work indefinitely because of a slackening in the trade, liable again to be kept overtime in rush seasons, and be worked till she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) trembled in every nerve and lost her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) grip on her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) slimy knife, and gave herself a poisoned wound--that was the new life that unfolded itself before Marija.
<p/>But because Marija was a human horse she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) merely laughed and went at it; it would enable her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) board again, and keep the family going.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) first came to Packingtown, Marija would have scorned such work as this. And as for Tamoszius--well, they had waited a long time, and they could wait a little longer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) could come and visit her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), and sit in the kitchen and hold her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) must manage to be content with that.
<p/>But day by day the music of Tamoszius' violin became more passionate and heartbreaking; and Marija would sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands clasped and her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) cheeks wet and all her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) body a-tremble, hearing in the wailing melodies the voices of the unborn generations which cried out in her (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) for life.
<p/>They could not possibly get along upon his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wages alone, and the family could not live without hers. Marija's lesson came just in time to save Ona from a similar fate.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) did not tell half of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) story at home, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) saw it was a torment to Jurgis, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was afraid of what he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) might do.
<p/>Ona, too, was dissatisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place, and had far more reason than Marija. For a long time Ona had seen that Miss Henderson, the forelady in her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) department, did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>).
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) thought it was the old-time mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) had made in asking for a holiday to get married. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) concluded it must be because she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) did not give the forelady a present occasionally
<p/>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was the kind that took presents from the girls, Ona learned, and made all sorts of discriminations in favor of those who gave them.
<p/>Miss Henderson was a newcomer, and it was some time before rumor made her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) out; but finally it transpired that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was a kept woman, the former mistress of the superintendent of a department in the same building.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) had put her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) there to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) quiet, it seemed--and that not altogether with success, for once or twice they had been heard quarreling.
<p/>In the end, however, Ona discovered that it was even worse than that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had the temper of a hyena, and soon the place she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) ran was a witch's caldron.
<p/>There were some of the girls who were of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) own sort, who were willing to toady to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and flatter her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>); and these would carry tales about the rest, and so the furies were unchained in the place.
<p/>Worse than this, the woman lived in a bawdy-house downtown, with a coarse, red-faced Irishman named Connor, who was the boss of the loading-gang outside, and would make free with the girls as they went to and from their work.
<p/>In the slack seasons some of them would go with Miss Henderson to this house downtown--in fact, it would not be too much to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) managed her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) department at Brown's in conjunction with it.
<p/>Sometimes women from the house would be given places alongside of decent girls, and after other decent girls had been turned off to make room for them.
<p/>When you worked in this woman's department the house downtown was never out of your thoughts all day--there were always whiffs of it to be caught, like the odor of the Packingtown rendering plants at night, when the wind shifted suddenly.
<p/>There would be stories about it going the rounds; the girls opposite you would be telling them and winking at you.
<p/>In such a place Ona would not have stayed a day, but for starvation; and, as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was never sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) could stay the next day.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) understood now that the real reason that Miss Henderson hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was a decent married girl; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) knew that the talebearers and the toadies hated her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) for the same reason, and were doing their best to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) life miserable.
<p/>if she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) was particular about things of this sort; there was no place in it where a prostitute could not get along better than a decent girl.
<p/>Here was a population, low-class and mostly foreign, hanging always on the verge of starvation, and dependent for its opportunities of life upon the whim of men every bit as brutal and unscrupulous as the old-time slave drivers; under such circumstances immorality was exactly as inevitable, and as prevalent, as it was under the system of chattel slavery.
<p/>Things that were quite unspeakable went on there in the packing houses all the time, and were taken for granted by everybody; only they did not show, as in the old slavery times, because there was no difference in color between master and slave.
<p/>One morning Ona stayed home, and Jurgis had the man-doctor, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) whim, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) was safely delivered of a fine baby.
<p/>But there was no place a girl could go in Packingtown, It was an enormous big boy, and Ona was such a tiny creature herself, that it seemed quite incredible.
<p/>Jurgis would stand and gaze at the stranger by the hour, unable to believe that it had really happened. The coming of this boy was a decisive event with Jurgis.
<p/>It made him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) irrevocably a family man; it killed the last lingering impulse that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might have had to go out in the evenings and sit and talk with the men in the saloons.
<p/>There was nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cared for now so much as to sit and look at the baby. This was very curious, for Jurgis had never been interested in babies before.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had the brightest little black eyes, and little black ringlets all over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head; he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was the living image of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father, everybody said--and Jurgis found this a fascinating circumstance.
<p/>It was sufficiently perplexing that this tiny mite of life should have come into the world at all in the manner that it had; that it should have come with a comical imitation of its father's nose was simply uncanny.
<p/>But then, this was a very unusual sort of a baby. Perhaps, Jurgis thought, this was intended to signify that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) baby; that it was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
<p/>Jurgis had never possessed anything nearly so interesting--a baby was, when you came to think about it, assuredly a marvelous possession.
<p/>It would grow up to be a man, a human soul, with a personality all its own, a will of its own!
<p/>and Ona's, to care for all its life. Such thoughts would keep haunting Jurgis, filling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with all sorts of strange and almost painful excitements.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wonderfully proud of little Antanas; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was curious about all the details of him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>)--the washing and the dressing and the eating and the sleeping of him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), and asked all sorts of absurd questions.
<p/>Jurgis had, alas, very little time to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) baby; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) never felt the chains about him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) more than just then.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) came home at night, the baby would be asleep, and it would be the merest chance if he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) awoke before Jurgis had to go to sleep himself.
<p/>It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) quite a while to get over his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) alarm at the incredible shortness of the little creature's legs. Then in the morning there was no time to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), so really
<p/>This was more cruel yet for Ona, who ought to have stayed home and nursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), the doctor said, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) own health as well as the baby's; but Ona had to go to work, and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) for Teta Elzbieta to feed upon the pale blue poison that was called milk at the corner grocery.
<p/>Ona's confinement lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) only a week's wages--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would go to the factory the second Monday, and the best that Jurgis could persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was to ride in the car, and let him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) run along behind and help her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) to Brown's when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) alighted.
<p/>After that it would be all right, said Ona, it was no strain sitting still sewing hams all day; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) waited longer she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) might find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) dreadful forelady had put some one else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place.
<p/>the only chance the father had was on Sundays. That would be a greater calamity than ever now, Ona continued, on account of the baby.
<p/>They would all have to work harder now on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) account. It was such a responsibility--they must not have the baby grow up to suffer as they had.
<p/>And this indeed had been the first thing that Jurgis had thought of himself--he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands and braced himself anew for the struggle, for the sake of that tiny mite of human possibility.
<p/>And so Ona went back to Brown's and saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place and a week's wages; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) gave herself some one of the thousand ailments that women group under the title of <div class="bookquote">``womb trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>and was never again a well person as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) lived.
<p/>It is difficult to convey in words all that this meant to Ona; it seemed such a slight offense, and the punishment was so out of all proportion, that neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) nor any one else ever connected the two.
<p/>Womb trouble'' to Ona did not mean a specialist's diagnosis, and a course of treatment, and perhaps an operation or two; it meant simply headaches and pains in the back, and depression and heartsickness, and neuralgia when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had to go to work in the rain.
<p/>The great majority of the women who worked in Packingtown suffered in the same way, and from the same cause, so it was not deemed a thing to see the doctor about; instead Ona would try patent medicines, one after another, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) friends told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) about them.
<p/>As these all contained alcohol, or some other stimulant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) found that they all did her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) good while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) took them; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was always chasing the phantom of good health, and losing it because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was too poor to continue.
<p/>'' Chapter 11 During the summer the packing houses were in full activity again, and Jurgis made more money. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not make so much, however, as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had the previous summer, for the packers took on more hands.
<p/>it was a regular system; and this number they would keep over to the next slack season, so that every one would have less than ever.
<p/>There were new men every week, it seemed-- Sooner or later, by this plan, they would have all the floating labor of Chicago trained to do their work.
<p/>The men were to teach new hands, who would some day come and break their strike; and meantime they were kept so poor that they could not prepare for the trial!
<p/>And how very cunning a trick was that! But let no one suppose that this superfluity of employees meant easier work for any one!
<p/>On the contrary, the speeding-up seemed to be growing more savage all the time; they were continually inventing new devices to crowd the work on--it was for all the world like the thumbscrew of the medieval torture chamber.
<p/>They would get new pacemakers and pay them more; they would drive the men on with new machinery--it was said that in the hog-killing rooms the speed at which the hogs moved was determined by clockwork, and that it was increased a little every day.
<p/>In piecework they would reduce the time, requiring the same work in a shorter time, and paying the same wages; and then, after the workers had accustomed themselves to this new speed, they would reduce the rate of payment to correspond with the reduction in time!
<p/>They had done this so often in the canning establishments that the girls were fairly desperate; their wages had gone down by a full third in the past two years, and a storm of discontent was brewing that was likely to break any day.
<p/>Only a month after Marija had become a beef-trimmer the canning factory that she (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) had left posted a cut that would divide the girls' earnings almost squarely in half; and so great was the indignation at this that they marched out without even a parley, and organized in the street outside.
<p/>One of the girls had read somewhere that a red flag was the proper symbol for oppressed workers, and so they mounted one, and paraded all about the yards, yelling with rage.
<p/>A new union was the result of this outburst, but the impromptu strike went to pieces in three days, owing to the rush of new labor.
<p/>At the end of it the girl who had carried the red flag went downtown and got a position in a great department store, at a salary of two dollars and a half a week.
<p/>Once or twice there had been rumors that one of the big houses was going to cut its unskilled men to fifteen cents an hour, and Jurgis knew that if this was done, his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) turn would come soon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had learned by this time that Packingtown was really not a number of firms at all, but one great firm, the Beef Trust.
<p/>And every week the managers of it got together and compared notes, and there was one scale for all the workers in the yards and one standard of efficiency.
<p/>Jurgis was told that they also fixed the price they would pay for beef on the hoof and the price of all dressed meat in the country; but that was something he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not understand or care about.
<p/>The only one who was not afraid of a cut was Marija, who congratulated herself, somewhat naively, that there had been one in her (<font color='blue'><b>workers</b></font>) place only a short time before she (<font color='blue'><b>workers</b></font>) came.
<p/>Jurgis and Ona heard these stories with dismay, for there was no telling when their own time might come. Marija was getting to be a skilled beef-trimmer, and was mounting to the heights again.
<p/>During the summer and fall Jurgis and Ona managed to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) back the last penny they owed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) began to have a bank account.
<p/>Tamoszius had a bank account also, and they ran a race, and began to figure upon household expenses once more. The possession of vast wealth entails cares and responsibilities, however, as poor Marija found out.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had taken the advice of a friend and invested her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) savings in a bank on Ashland Avenue. Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) knew nothing about it, except that it was big and imposing
<p/>--what possible chance has a poor foreign working girl to understand the banking business, as it is conducted in this land of frenzied finance?
<p/>So Marija lived in a continual dread lest something should happen to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bank, and would go out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way mornings to make sure that it was still there.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) principal thought was of fire, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had deposited her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money in bills, and was afraid that if they were burned up the bank would not give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) any others.
<p/>Jurgis made fun of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for this, for he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a man and was proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) superior knowledge, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that the bank had fireproof vaults, and all its millions of dollars hidden safely away in them.
<p/>However, one morning Marija took her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) usual detour, and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) horror and dismay, saw a crowd of people in front of the bank, filling the avenue solid for half a block.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) broke into a run, shouting to the people to ask what was the matter, but not stopping to hear what they answered, till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had come to where the throng was so dense that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could no longer advance.
<p/>There was a <div class="bookquote">``run on the bank,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>they told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) then, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know what that was, and turned from one person to another, trying in an agony of fear to make out what they meant.
<p/>All the blood went out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face for terror. Had something gone wrong with the bank? Nobody was sure, but they thought so.
<p/>Couldn't she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money? There was no telling; the people were afraid not, and they were all trying to get it.
<p/>So in a frenzy of despair Marija began to claw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way toward the doors of this building, through a throng of men, women, and children, all as excited as herself.
<p/>It was a scene of wild confusion, women shrieking and wringing their hands and fainting, and men fighting and trampling down everything in their way.
<p/>In the midst of the melee Marija recollected that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bankbook, and could not get her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) money anyway, so she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fought her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way out and started on a run for home.
<p/>It was too early yet to tell anything--the bank would not open for nearly three hours. This was fortunate for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), for a few minutes later the police reserves arrived.
<p/>In half an hour Marija was back, Teta Elzbieta with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), both of them breathless with running and sick with fear.
<p/>The crowd was now formed in a line, extending for several blocks, with half a hundred policemen keeping guard, and so there was nothing for them to do but to take their places at the end of it.
<p/>At nine o'clock the bank opened and began to pay the waiting throng; but then, what good did that do Marija, who saw three thousand people before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>)--enough to take out the last penny of a dozen banks?
<p/>To make matters worse a drizzling rain came up, and soaked them to the skin; yet all the morning they stood there, creeping slowly toward the goal--all the afternoon they stood there, heartsick, seeing that the hour of closing was coming, and that they were going to be left out.
<p/>Marija made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) mind that, come what might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) would stay there and keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) place; but as nearly all did the same, all through the long, cold night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) got very little closer to the bank for that.
<p/>Toward evening Jurgis came; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had heard the story from the children, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) brought some food and dry wraps, which made it a little easier.
<p/>Marija held on like grim death, and toward afternoon she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) got into the bank and got her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) money--all in big silver dollars, a handkerchief full.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had once got her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) hands on them her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) fear vanished, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) wanted to put them back again; but the man at the window was savage, and said that the bank would receive no more deposits from those who had taken part in the run.
<p/>So Marija was forced to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) dollars home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), watching to right and left, expecting every instant that some one would try to rob her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>); and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) got home
<p/>The next morning, before daybreak, came a bigger crowd than ever, and more policemen from downtown. she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was not much better off.
<p/>Until she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) could find another bank there was nothing to do but sew them up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) clothes, and so Marija went about for a week or more, loaded down with bullion, and afraid to cross the street in front of the house, because Jurgis told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) would sink out of sight in the mud.
<p/>Weighted this way she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) way to the yards, again in fear, this time to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) place; but fortunately about ten per cent of the working people of Packingtown had been depositors in that bank, and it was not convenient to discharge that many at once.
<p/>The cause of the panic had been the attempt of a policeman to arrest a drunken man in a saloon next door, which had drawn a crowd at the hour the people were on their way to work, and so started the <div class="bookquote">``run.
<p/>Besides having paid Jonas and Marija, they had almost paid for their furniture, and could have that little sum to count on.
<p/>So long as each of them could bring home nine or ten dollars a week, they were able to get along finely.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>About this time Jurgis and Ona also began a bank account. Also election day came round again, and Jurgis made half a week's wages out of that, all net profit.
<p/>The two rival sets of grafters hired halls and set off fireworks and made speeches, to try to get the people interested in the matter.
<p/>Although Jurgis did not understand it all, he (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) knew enough by this time to realize that it was not supposed to be right to sell your vote.
<p/>However, as every one did it, and his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) refusal to join would not have made the slightest difference in the results, the idea of refusing would have seemed absurd, had it ever come into his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) head.
<p/>It was a very close election that year, and the echoes of the battle reached even to Packingtown. Now chill winds and shortening days began to warn them that the winter was coming again.
<p/>It seemed as if the respite had been too short--they had not had time enough to get ready for it; but still it came, inexorably, and the hunted look began to come back into the eyes of little Stanislovas.
<p/>The prospect struck fear to the heart of Jurgis also, for he (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) knew that Ona was not fit to face the cold and the snowdrifts this year.
<p/>And suppose that some day when a blizzard struck them and the cars were not running, Ona should have to give up, and should come the next day to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place had been given to some one who lived nearer and could be depended on?
<p/>It was the week before Christmas that the first storm came, and then the soul of Jurgis rose up within him (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) like a sleeping lion.
<p/>There were four days that the Ashland Avenue cars were stalled, and in those days, for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) life, Jurgis knew what it was to be really opposed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) had faced difficulties before, but they had been child's play; now there was a death struggle, and all the furies were unchained within him (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>).
<p/>, Ona wrapped all in blankets and tossed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) shoulder like a sack of meal, and the little boy, bundled nearly out of sight, hanging by his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) coat-tails.
<p/>There was a raging blast beating in his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) face, and the thermometer stood below zero; the snow was never short of his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) knees, and in some of the drifts it was nearly up to his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) armpits.
<p/>It would catch his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) feet and try to trip him (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>); it would build itself into a wall before him (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) back; and he (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) would fling himself into it, plunging like a wounded buffalo, puffing and snorting in rage.
<p/>So foot by foot he (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) drove his (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) way, and when at last he (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) came to Durham's he (<font color='blue'><b>grafters</b></font>) was staggering and almost blind, and leaned against a pillar, gasping, and thanking God that the cattle came late to the killing beds that day.
<p/>In the evening the same thing had to be done again; and because Jurgis could not tell what hour of the night he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would get off, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) got a saloon-keeper to let Ona sit and wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in a corner.
<p/>The first morning they set out two hours before dawn Once it was eleven o'clock at night, and black as the pit, but still they got home.
<p/>That blizzard knocked many a man out, for the crowd outside begging for work was never greater, and the packers would not wait long for any one.
<p/>When it was over, the soul of Jurgis was a song, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had met the enemy and conquered, and felt himself the master of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fate.--So it might be with some monarch of the forest that has vanquished his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foes in fair fight, and then falls into some cowardly trap in the night-time.
<p/>Sometimes, in the haste of speeding-up, they would dump one of the animals out on the floor before it was fully stunned, and it would get upon its feet and run amuck.
<p/>Then there would be a yell of warning--the men would drop everything and dash for the nearest pillar, slipping here and there on the floor, and tumbling over each other.
<p/>This was bad enough in the summer, when a man could see; in wintertime it was enough to make your hair stand up, for the room would be so full of steam that you could not make anything out five feet in front of you.
<p/>To be sure, the steer was generally blind and frantic, and not especially bent on hurting any one; but think of the chances of running upon a knife, while nearly every man had one in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand!
<p/>A time of peril on the killing beds was when a steer broke loose. And then, to cap the climax, the floor boss would come rushing up with a rifle and begin blazing away!
<p/>It was in one of these melees that Jurgis fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) trap. That is the only word to describe it; it was so cruel, and so utterly not to be foreseen.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) hardly noticed it, it was such a slight accident--simply that in leaping out of the way he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) ankle.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) came to walk home, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) realized that it was hurting him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) a great deal; and in the morning his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) ankle was swollen out nearly double its size, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) could not get his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) foot into his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) shoe.
<p/>Still, even then, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) did nothing more than swear a little, and wrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) foot in old rags, and hobbled out to take the car.
<p/>It chanced to be a rush day at Durham's, and all the long morning he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) limped about with his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) aching foot; by noontime the pain was so great that it made him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) faint, and after a couple of hours in the afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was fairly beaten, and had to tell the boss.
<p/>They sent for the company doctor, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) examined the foot and told Jurgis to go home to bed, adding that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had probably laid himself up for months by his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) folly.
<p/>The injury was not one that Durham and Company could be held responsible for, and so that was all there was to it, so far as the doctor was concerned.
<p/>Jurgis got home somehow, scarcely able to see for the pain, and with an awful terror in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) soul, Elzbieta helped him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) into bed and bandaged his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) injured foot with cold water and tried hard not to let him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) dismay; when the rest came home at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) met them outside and told them, and they, too, put on a cheerful face, saying it would only be for a week or two, and that they would pull him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) through.
<p/>When they had gotten him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) to sleep, however, they sat by the kitchen fire and talked it over in frightened whispers.
<p/>There was a twinge of pain, but Jurgis was used to pain, and did not coddle himself. They were in for a siege, that was plainly to be seen.
<p/>Both Jonas and Marija might soon be earning no more than enough to pay their board, and besides that there were only the wages of Ona and the pittance of the little boy.
<p/>There was the rent to pay, and still some on the furniture; there was the insurance just due, and every month there was sack after sack of coal.
<p/>Jurgis had only about sixty dollars in the bank, and the slack season was upon them. It was January, midwinter, an awful time to have to face privation.
<p/>Deep snows would come again, and who would carry Ona to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) work now? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) might lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was almost certain to lose it.
<p/>And then little Stanislovas began to whimper--who would take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>)? It was dreadful that an accident of this sort, that no man can help, should have meant such suffering.
<p/>It was of no use for them to try to deceive him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew as much about the situation as they did, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that the family might literally starve to death.
<p/>The bitterness of it was the daily food and drink of Jurgis. The worry of it fairly ate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to look haggard the first two or three days of it.
<p/>In truth, it was almost maddening for a strong man like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), a fighter, to have to lie there helpless on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back.
<p/>It was for all the world the old story of Prometheus bound. As Jurgis lay on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bed, hour after hour there came to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) emotions that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never known before.
<p/>But now, in the nighttime, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay tossing about, there would come stalking into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chamber a grisly phantom, the sight of which made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flesh curl and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hair to bristle up.
<p/>It was like seeing the world fall away from underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet; like plunging down into a bottomless abyss into yawning caverns of despair.
<p/>It might be true, then, after all, what others had told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) about life, that the best powers of a man might not be equal to it!
<p/>It might be true that, strive as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would, toil as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might fail, and go down and be destroyed!
<p/>The thought of this was like an icy hand at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart; the thought that here, in this ghastly home of all horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and all those who were dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might lie and perish of starvation and cold, and there would be no ear to hear their cry, no hand to help them!
<p/>It was true, it was true,--that here in this huge city, with its stores of heaped-up wealth, human creatures might be hunted down and destroyed by the wild-beast powers of nature, just as truly as ever they were in the days of the cave men!
<p/>Before this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had met life with a welcome--it had its trials, but none that a man could not face. Ona was now making about thirty dollars a month, and Stanislovas about thirteen.
<p/>Deducting from this the rent, interest, and installments on the furniture, they had left sixty dollars, and deducting the coal, they had fifty.
<p/>They did without everything that human beings could do without; they went in old and ragged clothing, that left them at the mercy of the cold, and when the children's shoes wore out, they tied them up with string.
<p/>Half invalid as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was, Ona would do herself harm by walking in the rain and cold when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) ought to have ridden; they bought literally nothing but food--and still they could not keep alive on fifty dollars a month.
<p/>They might have done it, if only they could have gotten pure food, and at fair prices; or if only they had known what to get--if they had not been so pitifully ignorant!
<p/>To add to this there was the board of Jonas and Marija, about forty-five dollars. But they had come to a new country, where everything was different, including the food.
<p/>They had always been accustomed to eat a great deal of smoked sausage, and how could they know that what they bought in America was not the same--that its color was made by chemicals, and its smoky flavor by more chemicals, and that it was full of <div class="bookquote">``potato flour''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>besides?
<p/>Potato flour is the waste of potato after the starch and alcohol have been extracted; it has no more food value than so much wood, and as its use as a food adulterant is a penal offense in Europe, thousands of tons of it are shipped to America every year.
<p/>A dollar sixty-five a day was simply not enough to feed them, and there was no use trying; and so each week they made an inroad upon the pitiful little bank account that Ona had begun.
<p/>Because the account was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) name, it was possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) to keep this a secret from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) husband, and to keep the heartsickness of it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) own.
<p/>It was amazing what quantities of food such as this were needed every day, by eleven hungry persons. It would have been better if Jurgis had been really ill; if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not been able to think.
<p/>For he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had no resources such as most invalids have; all he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could do was to lie there and toss about from side to side.
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would break into cursing, regardless of everything; and now and then his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) impatience would get the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would try to get up, and poor Teta Elzbieta would have to plead with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in a frenzy.
<p/>Elzbieta was all alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the greater part of the time. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) would sit and smooth his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) forehead by the hour, and talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and try to make him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) forget.
<p/>Sometimes it would be too cold for the children to go to school, and they would have to play in the kitchen, where Jurgis was, because it was the only room that was half warm.
<p/>These were dreadful times, for Jurgis would get as cross as any bear; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was scarcely to be blamed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had enough to worry him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and it was hard when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was trying to take a nap to be kept awake by noisy and peevish children.
<p/>Elzbieta's only resource in those times was little Antanas; indeed, it would be hard to say how they could have gotten along at all if it had not been for little Antanas.
<p/>Teta Elzbieta would put the clothes-basket in which the baby slept alongside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) mattress, and Jurgis would lie upon one elbow and watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) by the hour, imagining things.
<p/>Then little Antanas would open his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) eyes--he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was beginning to take notice of things now; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would smile--how he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would smile!
<p/>So Jurgis would begin to forget and be happy because he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was in a world where there was a thing so beautiful as the smile of little Antanas, and because such a world could not but be good at the heart of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) looked more like his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) father every hour, Elzbieta would say, and said it many times a day, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) saw that it pleased Jurgis; the poor little terror-stricken woman was planning all day and all night to soothe the prisoned giant who was intrusted to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) care.
<p/>Jurgis, who knew nothing about the age-long and everlasting hypocrisy of woman, would take the bait and grin with delight; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) finger in front of little Antanas' eyes, and move it this way and that, and laugh with glee to see the baby follow it.
<p/>There is no pet quite so fascinating as a baby; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would look into Jurgis' face with such uncanny seriousness, and Jurgis would start and cry: <div class="bookquote">``Palauk!
<p/>It was the one consolation of Jurgis' long imprisonment that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had time to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) baby. Look, Muma, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) papa!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) does, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) does! Tu mano szirdele, the little rascal!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Chapter 12 For three weeks after his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) injury Jurgis never got up from bed.
<p/>At the end of that time, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) could contain himself no longer, and began trying to walk a little every day, laboring to persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was better.
<p/>It was a very obstinate sprain; the swelling would not go down, and the pain still continued. No arguments could stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), and three or four days later he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was going back to work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) limped to the cars and got to Brown's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) found that the boss had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) place--that is, was willing to turn out into the snow the poor devil he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had hired in the meantime.
<p/>Every now and then the pain would force Jurgis to stop work, but he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) stuck it out till nearly an hour before closing.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was forced to acknowledge that he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) could not go on without fainting; it almost broke his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) heart to do it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) stood leaning against a pillar and weeping like a child.
<p/>Two of the men had to help him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to the car, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) got out he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) had to sit down and wait in the snow till some one came along.
<p/>So they put him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) to bed again, and sent for the doctor, as they ought to have done in the beginning.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) gripped the sides of the bed, and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) teeth together, and turned white with agony, while the doctor pulled and wrenched away at his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) swollen ankle.
<p/>When finally the doctor left, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would have to lie quiet for two months, and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went to work before that time he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) might lame himself for life.
<p/>Three days later there came another heavy snowstorm, and Jonas and Marija and Ona and little Stanislovas all set out together, an hour before daybreak, to try to get to the yards.
<p/>It transpired that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) had twisted a tendon out of place, and could never have gotten well without attention. About noon the last two came back, the boy screaming with pain.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fingers were all frosted, it seemed. They had had to give up trying to get to the yards, and had nearly perished in a drift.
<p/>All that they knew how to do was to hold the frozen fingers near the fire, and so little Stanislovas spent most of the day dancing about in horrible agony, till Jurgis flew into a passion of nervous rage and swore like a madman, declaring that he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>madman</b></font>) did not stop.
<p/>All that day and night the family was half-crazed with fear that Ona and the boy had lost their places; and in the morning they set out earlier than ever, after the little fellow had been beaten with a stick by Jurgis.
<p/>There could be no trifling in a case like this, it was a matter of life and death; little Stanislovas could not be expected to realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might a great deal better freeze in the snowdrift than lose his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) job at the lard machine.
<p/>Ona was quite certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would find her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place gone, and was all unnerved when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) finally got to Brown's, and found that the forelady herself had failed to come, and was therefore compelled to be lenient.
<p/>One of the consequences of this episode was that the first joints of three of the little boy's fingers were permanently disabled, and another that thereafter he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) always had to be beaten before he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) set out to work, whenever there was fresh snow on the ground.
<p/>Jurgis was called upon to do the beating, and as it hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) foot he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) did it with a vengeance; but it did not tend to add to the sweetness of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) temper.
<p/>They say that the best dog will turn cross if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) be kept chained all the time, and it was the same with the man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not a thing to do all day but lie and curse his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fate, and the time came when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted to curse everything.
<p/>The poor fellow looked like a homeless ghost, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cheeks sunken in and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) long black hair straggling into his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was too discouraged to cut it, or to think about his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) appearance.
<p/>This was never for very long, however, for when Ona began to cry, Jurgis could not stay angry. His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) muscles were wasting away, and what were left were soft and flabby.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had no appetite, and they could not afford to tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) with delicacies. It was better, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) should not eat, it was a saving.
<p/>About the end of March he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had got hold of Ona's bankbook, and learned that there was only three dollars left to them in the world.
<p/>But perhaps the worst of the consequences of this long siege was that they lost another member of their family; Brother Jonas disappeared.
<p/>One Saturday night he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) did not come home, and thereafter all their efforts to get trace of him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) were futile. It was said by the boss at Durham's that he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) had gotten his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) week's money and left there.
<p/>That might not be true, of course, for sometimes they would say that when a man had been killed; it was the easiest way out of it for all concerned.
<p/>When, for instance, a man had fallen into one of the rendering tanks and had been made into pure leaf lard and peerless fertilizer, there was no use letting the fact out and making his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family unhappy.
<p/>More probable, however, was the theory that Jonas had deserted them, and gone on the road, seeking happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) had been discontented for a long time, and not without some cause.
<p/>And Marija would keep giving them all her (<font color='blue'><b>family</b></font>) money, and of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) could not but feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) was called upon to do the same.
<p/>Then there were crying brats, and all sorts of misery; a man would have had to be a good deal of a hero to stand it all without grumbling, and Jonas was not in the least a hero--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) was simply a weatherbeaten old fellow who liked to have a good supper and sit in the corner by the fire and smoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) pipe in peace before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) went to bed.
<p/>Here there was not room by the fire, and through the winter the kitchen had seldom been warm enough for comfort.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) paid good board, and was yet obliged to live in a family where nobody had enough to eat. So, with the springtime, what was more likely than that the wild idea of escaping had come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>)?
<p/>Two years he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) had been yoked like a horse to a half-ton truck in Durham's dark cellars, with never a rest, save on Sundays and four holidays in the year, and with never a word of thanks--only kicks and blows and curses, such as no decent dog would have stood.
<p/>And now the winter was over, and the spring winds were blowing--and with a day's walk a man might put the smoke of Packingtown behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forever, and be where the grass was green and the flowers all the colors of the rainbow!
<p/>But now the income of the family was cut down more than one-third, and the food demand was cut only one-eleventh, so that they were worse off than ever.
<p/>Also they were borrowing money from Marija, and eating up her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) bank account, and spoiling once again her (<font color='blue'><b>dog</b></font>) hopes of marriage and happiness.
<p/>Poor Tamoszius was a man without any relatives, and with a wonderful talent besides, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have made money and prospered; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fallen in love, and so given hostages to fortune, and was doomed to be dragged down too.
<p/>And they were even going into debt to Tamoszius Kuszleika and letting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) impoverish himself. So it was finally decided that two more of the children would have to leave school.
<p/>Next to Stanislovas, who was now fifteen, there was a girl, little Kotrina, who was two years younger, and then two boys, Vilimas, who was eleven, and Nikalojus, who was ten.
<p/>Both of these last were bright boys, and there was no reason why their family should starve when tens of thousands of children no older were earning their own livings.
<p/>So one morning they were given a quarter apiece and a roll with a sausage in it, and, with their minds top-heavy with good advice, were sent out to make their way to the city and learn to sell newspapers.
<p/>They came back late at night in tears, having walked for the five or six miles to report that a man had offered to take them to a place where they sold newspapers, and had taken their money and gone into a store to get them, and nevermore been seen.
<p/>This time they found the newspaper place, and procured their stock; and after wandering about till nearly noontime, saying <div class="bookquote">``Paper?''  (<font color='red'><b>a newsman</b></font>)</div>to every one they saw, they had all their stock taken away and received a thrashing besides from a big newsman upon whose territory they had trespassed.
<p/>So they both received a whipping, and the next morning set out again. Fortunately, however, they had already sold some papers, and came back with nearly as much as they started with.
<p/>After a week of mishaps such as these, the two little fellows began to learn the ways of the trade--the names of the different papers, and how many of each to get, and what sort of people to offer them to, and where to go and where to stay away from.
<p/>After this, leaving home at four o'clock in the morning, and running about the streets, first with morning papers and then with evening, they might come home late at night with twenty or thirty cents apiece--possibly as much as forty cents.
<p/>From this they had to deduct their carfare, since the distance was so great; but after a while they made friends, and learned still more, and then they would save their carfare.
<p/>They would get on a car when the conductor was not looking, and hide in the crowd; and three times out of four he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) would not ask for their fares, either not seeing them, or thinking they had already paid; or if he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) did ask, they would hunt through their pockets, and then begin to cry, and either have their fares paid by some kind old lady, or else try the trick again on a new car.
<p/>Whose fault was it that at the hours when workingmen were going to their work and back, the cars were so crowded that the conductors could not collect all the fares?
<p/>All this was fair play, they felt. And besides, the companies were thieves, people said--had stolen all their franchises with the help of scoundrelly politicians!
<p/>Now that the winter was by, and there was no more danger of snow, and no more coal to buy, and another room warm enough to put the children into when they cried, and enough money to get along from week to week with, Jurgis was less terrible than he (<font color='blue'><b>companies</b></font>) had been.
<p/>A man can get used to anything in the course of time, and Jurgis had gotten used to lying about the house.
<p/>Ona saw this, and was very careful not to destroy his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) peace of mind, by letting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know how very much pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was suffering.
<p/>It was now the time of the spring rains, and Ona had often to ride to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) work, in spite of the expense; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was getting paler every day, and sometimes, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) good resolutions, it pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) that Jurgis did not notice it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cared for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) as much as ever, if all this misery was not wearing out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had to be away from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all the time, and bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) own troubles while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was bearing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and then, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) came home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was so worn out; and whenever they talked they had only their worries to talk of--truly it was hard, in such a life, to keep any sentiment alive.
<p/>The woe of this would flame up in Ona sometimes--at night she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would suddenly clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) big husband in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) arms and break into passionate weeping, demanding to know if he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>Poor Jurgis, who had in truth grown more matter-of-fact, under the endless pressure of penury, would not know what to make of these things, and could only try to recollect when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had last been cross; and so Ona would have to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and sob herself to sleep.
<p/>The latter part of April Jurgis went to see the doctor, and was given a bandage to lace about his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) ankle, and told that he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) might go back to work.
<p/>It needed more than the permission of the doctor, however, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) showed up on the killing floor of Brown's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) was told by the foreman that it had not been possible to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) job for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>).
<p/>Jurgis knew that this meant simply that the foreman had found some one else to do the work as well and did not want to bother to make a change.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) stood in the doorway, looking mournfully on, seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) friends and companions at work, and feeling like an outcast. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) went out and took his (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) place with the mob of the unemployed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) was no longer the finest-looking man in the throng, and the bosses no longer made for him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) was thin and haggard, and his (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) clothes were seedy, and he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) looked miserable.
<p/>And there were hundreds who looked and felt just like him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>), and who had been wandering about Packingtown for months begging for work.
<p/>This was a critical time in Jurgis' life, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) had been a weaker man he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) would have gone the way the rest did.
<p/>Those out-of-work wretches would stand about the packing houses every morning till the police drove them away, and then they would scatter among the saloons.
<p/>Very few of them had the nerve to face the rebuffs that they would encounter by trying to get into the buildings to interview the bosses; if they did not get a chance in the morning, there would be nothing to do but hang about the saloons the rest of the day and night.
<p/>Jurgis was saved from all this--partly, to be sure, because it was pleasant weather, and there was no need to be indoors; but mainly because he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) carried with him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) always the pitiful little face of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wife.
<p/>This time, however, Jurgis did not have the same fine confidence, nor the same reason for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) must get work, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) told himself, fighting the battle with despair every hour of the day.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) must get work! He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) must have a place again and some money saved up, before the next winter came. But there was no work for him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sought out all the members of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) union--Jurgis had stuck to the union through all this--and begged them to speak a word for him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) wandered all day through the buildings; and in a week or two, when he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had been all over the yards, and into every room to which he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had access, and learned that there was not a job anywhere, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) persuaded himself that there might have been a change in the places he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had first visited, and began the round all over; till finally the watchmen and the <div class="bookquote">``spotters''  (<font color='red'><b>the watchmen spotters</b></font>)</div>of the companies came to know him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) by sight and to order him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) out with threats.
<p/>Then there was nothing more for him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to do but go with the crowd in the morning, and keep in the front row and look eager, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) failed, go back home, and play with little Kotrina and the baby.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) went to every one he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) knew, asking for a chance, there or anywhere. The peculiar bitterness of all this was that Jurgis saw so plainly the meaning of it.
<p/>In the beginning he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had been fresh and strong, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had gotten a job the first day; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was second-hand, a damaged article, so to speak, and they did not want him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).
<p/>They had got the best of him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)--they had worn him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) out, with their speeding-up and their carelessness, and now they had thrown him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) away!
<p/>And Jurgis would make the acquaintance of others of these unemployed men and find that they had all had the same experience.
<p/>There were some, of course, who had wandered in from other places, who had been ground up in other mills; there were others who were out from their own fault--some, for instance, who had not been able to stand the awful grind without drink.
<p/>The vast majority, however, were simply the worn-out parts of the great merciless packing machine; they had toiled there, and kept up with the pace, some of them for ten or twenty years, until finally the time had come when they could not keep up with it any more.
<p/>Some had been frankly told that they were too old, that a sprier man was needed; others had given occasion, by some act of carelessness or incompetence; with most, however, the occasion had been the same as with Jurgis.
<p/>They had been overworked and underfed so long, and finally some disease had laid them on their backs; or they had cut themselves, and had blood poisoning, or met with some other accident.
<p/>To this there was no exception, save when the accident was one for which the firm was liable; in that case they would send a slippery lawyer to see him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>), first to try to get him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to sign away his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) claims, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was too smart for that, to promise him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) should always be provided with work.
<p/>When a man came back after that, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place back only by the courtesy of the boss. This promise they would keep, strictly and to the letter--for two years.
<p/>Two years was the <div class="bookquote">``statute of limitations,''  (<font color='red'><b>the victim</b></font>)</div>and after that the victim could not sue. What happened to a man after any of these things, all depended upon the circumstances.
<p/>The best paid men, the <div class="bookquote">``splitters,''  (<font color='red'><b>The men splitters</b></font>)</div>made fifty cents an hour, which would be five or six dollars a day in the rush seasons, and one or two in the dullest.
<p/>A man could live and save on that; but then there were only half a dozen splitters in each place, and one of them that Jurgis knew had a family of twenty-two children, all hoping to grow up to be splitters like their father.
<p/>For an unskilled man, who made ten dollars a week in the rush seasons and five in the dull, it all depended upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age and the number he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had dependent upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>An unmarried man could save, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not drink, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was absolutely selfish--that is, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paid no heed to the demands of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old parents, or of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) little brothers and sisters, or of any other relatives he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have, as well as of the members of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) union, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chums, and the people who might be starving to death next door.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were of the highly skilled workers, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would probably have enough saved up to tide him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over. Chapter 13
<p/>During this time that Jurgis was looking for work occurred the death of little Kristoforas, one of the children of Teta Elzbieta.
<p/>Both Kristoforas and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother, Juozapas, were cripples, the latter having lost one leg by having it run over, and Kristoforas having congenital dislocation of the hip, which made it impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever to walk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the last of Teta Elzbieta's children, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been intended by nature to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had had enough.
<p/>At any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wretchedly sick and undersized; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the rickets, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was over three years old, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was no bigger than an ordinary child of one.
<p/>All day long he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would crawl around the floor in a filthy little dress, whining and fretting; because the floor was full of drafts he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always catching cold, and snuffling because his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nose ran.
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, with unnatural perversity, loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best of all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) children, and made a perpetual fuss over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--would let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do anything undisturbed, and would burst into tears when his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fretting drove Jurgis wild.
<p/>Perhaps it was the smoked sausage he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had eaten that morning--which may have been made out of some of the tubercular pork that was condemned as unfit for export.
<p/>At any rate, an hour after eating it, the child had begun to cry with pain, and in another hour he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was rolling about on the floor in convulsions.
<p/>Little Kotrina, who was all alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), ran out screaming for help, and after a while a doctor came, but not until Kristoforas had howled his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) last howl.
<p/>This made him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) a nuisance, and a source of endless trouble in the family. And now he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) died. No one was really sorry about this except poor Elzbieta, who was inconsolable.
<p/>Jurgis announced that so far as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was concerned the child would have to be buried by the city, since they had no money for a funeral; and at this the poor woman almost went out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) senses, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands and screaming with grief and despair.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) child to be buried in a pauper's grave! And her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stepdaughter to stand by and hear it said without protesting!
<p/>If it had come to this, they might as well give up at once, and be buried all of them together! ...
<p/>In the end Marija said that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would help with ten dollars; and Jurgis being still obdurate, Elzbieta went in tears and begged the money from the neighbors, and so little Kristoforas had a mass and a hearse with white plumes on it, and a tiny plot in a graveyard with a wooden cross to mark the place.
<p/>The poor mother was not the same for months after that; the mere sight of the floor where little Kristoforas had crawled about would make her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) weep.
<p/>It was enough to make Ona's father rise up out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) grave to rebuke her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never had a fair chance, poor little fellow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would say.
<p/>If only she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had heard about it in time, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) might have had that great doctor to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) lameness! ...
<p/>Some time ago, Elzbieta was told, a Chicago billionaire had paid a fortune to bring a great European surgeon over to cure his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) little daughter of the same disease from which Kristoforas had suffered.
<p/>And because this surgeon had to have bodies to demonstrate upon, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) would treat the children of the poor, a piece of magnanimity over which the papers became quite eloquent.
<p/>Elzbieta, alas, did not read the papers, and no one had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>); but perhaps it was as well, for just then they would not have had the carfare to spare to go every day to wait upon the surgeon, nor for that matter anybody with the time to take the child.
<p/>All this while that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was seeking for work, there was a dark shadow hanging over Jurgis; as if a savage beast were lurking somewhere in the pathway of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) knew it, and yet could not help approaching the place.
<p/>There are all stages of being out of work in Packingtown, and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) faced in dread the prospect of reaching the lowest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had been handicapped from his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) birth. There is a place that waits for the lowest man--the fertilizer plant! The men would talk about it in awe-stricken whispers.
<p/>Not more than one in ten had ever really tried it; the other nine had contented themselves with hearsay evidence and a peep through the door.
<p/>They would ask Jurgis if he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had worked there yet, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) meant to; and Jurgis would debate the matter with himself.
<p/>As poor as they were, and making all the sacrifices that they were, would he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) dare to refuse any sort of work that was offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), be it as horrible as ever it could?
<p/>Would he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) dare to go home and eat bread that had been earned by Ona, weak and complaining as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was, knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had been given a chance, and had not had the nerve to take it?--And
<p/>yet he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) might argue that way with himself all day, and one glimpse into the fertilizer works would send him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) away again shuddering.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was a man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) duty; he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) went and made application--but surely he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was not also required to hope for success!
<p/>There were some things worse than even starving to death. The fertilizer works of Durham's lay away from the rest of the plant.
<p/>Few visitors ever saw them, and the few who did would come out looking like Dante, of whom the peasants declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) had been into hell.
<p/>To this part of the yards came all the <div class="bookquote">``tankage''  (<font color='red'><b>men women children</b></font>)</div>and the waste products of all sorts; here they dried out the bones,--and in suffocating cellars where the daylight never came you might see men and women and children bending over whirling machines and sawing bits of bone into all sorts of shapes, breathing their lungs full of the fine dust, and doomed to die, every one of them, within a certain definite time.
<p/>Here they made the blood into albumen, and made other foul-smelling things into things still more foul-smelling. In the corridors and caverns where it was done you might lose yourself as in the great caves of Kentucky.
<p/>In the dust and the steam the electric lights would shine like far-off twinkling stars--red and blue-green and purple stars, according to the color of the mist and the brew from which it came.
<p/>For the odors of these ghastly charnel houses there may be words in Lithuanian, but there are none in English. The person entering would have to summon his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) courage as for a cold-water plunge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) would go in like a man swimming under water; he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) would put his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) handkerchief over his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) face, and begin to cough and choke; and then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) were still obstinate, he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) would find his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) head beginning to ring, and the veins in his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) forehead to throb, until finally he (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) would be assailed by an overpowering blast of ammonia fumes, and would turn and run for his (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) life, and come out half-dazed.
<p/>On top of this were the rooms where they dried the <div class="bookquote">``tankage,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the mass of brown stringy stuff that was left after the waste portions of the carcasses had had the lard and tallow dried out of them.
<p/>This dried material they would then grind to a fine powder, and after they had mixed it up well with a mysterious but inoffensive brown rock which they brought in and ground up by the hundreds of carloads for that purpose, the substance was ready to be put into bags and sent out to the world as any one of a hundred different brands of standard bone phosphate.
<p/>And then the farmer in Maine or California or Texas would buy this, at say twenty-five dollars a ton, and plant it with his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) corn; and for several days after the operation the fields would have a strong odor, and the farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wagon and the very horses that had hauled it would all have it too.
<p/>In Packingtown the fertilizer is pure, instead of being a flavoring, and instead of a ton or so spread out on several acres under the open sky, there are hundreds and thousands of tons of it in one building, heaped here and there in haystack piles, covering the floor several inches deep, and filling the air with a choking dust that becomes a blinding sandstorm when the wind stirs.
<p/>The month of May was an exceptionally cool one, and his (<font color='blue'><b>thousands</b></font>) secret prayers were granted; but early in June there came a record-breaking hot spell, and after that there were men wanted in the fertilizer mill.
<p/>The boss of the grinding room had come to know Jurgis by this time, and had marked him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) for a likely man; and so when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to the door about two o'clock this breathless hot day, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt a sudden spasm of pain shoot through him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--the boss beckoned to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!
<p/>In ten minutes more Jurgis had pulled off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat and overshirt, and set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth together and gone to work.
<p/>It was to this building that Jurgis came daily, as if dragged by an unseen hand. Here was one more difficulty for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to meet and conquer!
<p/>Before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was one of the vents of the mill in which the fertilizer was being ground--rushing forth in a great brown river, with a spray of the finest dust flung forth in clouds.
<p/>Jurgis was given a shovel, and along with half a dozen others it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) task to shovel this fertilizer into carts.
<p/>That others were at work he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew by the sound, and by the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sometimes collided with them; otherwise they might as well not have been there, for in the blinding dust storm a man could not see six feet in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had filled one cart he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to grope around him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) until another came, and if there was none on hand he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued to grope till one arrived.
<p/>In five minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, of course, a mass of fertilizer from head to feet; they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a sponge to tie over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could breathe, but the sponge did not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips and eyelids from caking up with it and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears from filling solid.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like a brown ghost at twilight--from hair to shoes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became the color of the building and of everything in it, and for that matter a hundred yards outside it.
<p/>The building had to be left open, and when the wind blew Durham and Company lost a great deal of fertilizer.
<p/>Working in his (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) shirt sleeves, and with the thermometer at over a hundred, the phosphates soaked in through every pore of Jurgis' skin, and in five minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) had a headache, and in fifteen was almost dazed.
<p/>The blood was pounding in his (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) brain like an engine's throbbing; there was a frightful pain in the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) skull, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) could hardly control his (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Still, with the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) four months' siege behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) fought on, in a frenzy of determination; and half an hour later he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) began to vomit--he (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) vomited until it seemed as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Company</b></font>) inwards must be torn into shreds.
<p/>A man could get used to the fertilizer mill, the boss had said, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) would make up his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) mind to it; but Jurgis now began to see that it was a question of making up his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) stomach.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) labor took him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) about one minute to learn. At the end of that day of horror, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) could scarcely stand.
<p/>Most of the men, when they came out, made straight for a saloon--they seemed to place fertilizer and rattlesnake poison in one class.
<p/>But Jurgis was too ill to think of drinking--he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) could only make his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) way to the street and stagger on to a car.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) had a sense of humor, and later on, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) became an old hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) used to think it fun to board a streetcar and see what happened.
<p/>Now, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was too ill to notice it--how the people in the car began to gasp and sputter, to put their handkerchiefs to their noses, and transfix him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) with furious glances.
<p/>Jurgis only knew that a man in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately got up and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a seat; and that half a minute later the two people on each side of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up; and that in a full minute the crowded car was nearly empty--those passengers who could not get room on the platform having gotten out to walk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to catch himself now and then, and lean against a building and get his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bearings. Of course Jurgis had made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home a miniature fertilizer mill a minute after entering.
<p/>The stuff was half an inch deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skin--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole system was full of it, and it would have taken a week not merely of scrubbing, but of vigorous exercise, to get it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be compared with nothing known to men, save that newest discovery of the savants, a substance which emits energy for an unlimited time, without being itself in the least diminished in power.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smelled so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made all the food at the table taste, and set the whole family to vomiting; for himself it was three days before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could keep anything upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stomach--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might wash his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and use a knife and fork, but were not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth and throat filled with the poison?
<p/>In spite of splitting headaches he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would stagger down to the plant and take up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stand once more, and begin to shovel in the blinding clouds of dust.
<p/>And so at the end of the week he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a fertilizer man for life--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was able to eat again, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head never stopped aching, it ceased to be so bad that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not work.
<p/>It was a summer of prosperity, all over the country, and the country ate generously of packing house products, and there was plenty of work for all the family, in spite of the packers' efforts to keep a superfluity of labor.
<p/>They were again able to pay their debts and to begin to save a little sum; but there were one or two sacrifices they considered too heavy to be made for long
<p/>And still Jurgis stuck it out! So there passed another summer. --it was too bad that the boys should have to sell papers at their age.
<p/>It was utterly useless to caution them and plead with them; quite without knowing it, they were taking on the tone of their new environment.
<p/>They were learning to swear in voluble English; they were learning to pick up cigar stumps and smoke them, to pass hours of their time gambling with pennies and dice and cigarette cards; they were learning the location of all the houses of prostitution on the <div class="bookquote">``Levee,''  (<font color='red'><b>police</b></font>)</div>and the names of the <div class="bookquote">``madames''  (<font color='red'><b>police</b></font>)</div>who kept them, and the days when they gave their state banquets, which the police captains and the big politicians all attended.
<p/>If a visiting <div class="bookquote">``country customer''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>were to ask them, they could show him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) which was <div class="bookquote">``Hinkydink's''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>famous saloon, and could even point out to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) by name the different gamblers and thugs and <div class="bookquote">``hold-up men''  (<font color='red'><b>thugs</b></font>)</div>who made the place their headquarters.
<p/>What was the use, they would ask, of wasting time and energy and a possible carfare riding out to the stockyards every night when the weather was pleasant and they could crawl under a truck or into an empty doorway and sleep exactly as well?
<p/>And worse yet, the boys were getting out of the habit of coming home at night. So long as they brought home a half dollar for each day, what mattered it when they brought it?
<p/>But Jurgis declared that from this to ceasing to come at all would not be a very long step, and so it was decided that Vilimas and Nikalojus should return to school in the fall, and that instead Elzbieta should go out and get some work, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) place at home being taken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) younger daughter.
<p/>Little Kotrina was like most children of the poor, prematurely made old; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) little brother, who was a cripple, and also of the baby; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had to cook the meals and wash the dishes and clean house, and have supper ready when the workers came home in the evening.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was only thirteen, and small for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) age, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) did all this without a murmur; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) mother went out, and after trudging a couple of days about the yards, settled down as a servant of a <div class="bookquote">``sausage machine.
<p/>Elzbieta was used to working, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) found this change a hard one, for the reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had to stand motionless upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) feet from seven o'clock in the morning till half-past twelve, and again from one till half-past five.
<p/>For the first few days it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) could not stand it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) suffered almost as much as Jurgis had from the fertilizer, and would come out at sundown with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) head fairly reeling.
<p/>Besides this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was working in one of the dark holes, by electric light, and the dampness, too, was deadly--there were always puddles of water on the floor, and a sickening odor of moist flesh in the room.
<p/>The people who worked here followed the ancient custom of nature, whereby the ptarmigan is the color of dead leaves in the fall and of snow in the winter, and the chameleon, who is black when he (<font color='blue'><b>chameleon</b></font>) lies upon a stump and turns green when he (<font color='blue'><b>chameleon</b></font>) moves to a leaf.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div>The men and women who worked in this department were precisely the color of the <div class="bookquote">``fresh country sausage''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>they made.
<p/>The sausage-room was an interesting place to visit, for two or three minutes, and provided that you did not look at the people; the machines were perhaps the most wonderful things in the entire plant.
<p/>Presumably sausages were once chopped and stuffed by hand, and if so it would be interesting to know how many workers had been displaced by these inventions.
<p/>On one side of the room were the hoppers, into which men shoveled loads of meat and wheelbarrows full of spices; in these great bowls were whirling knives that made two thousand revolutions a minute, and when the meat was ground fine and adulterated with potato flour, and well mixed with water, it was forced to the stuffing machines on the other side of the room.
<p/>The latter were tended by women; there was a sort of spout, like the nozzle of a hose, and one of the women would take a long string of <div class="bookquote">``casing''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>and put the end over the nozzle and then work the whole thing on, as one works on the finger of a tight glove.
<p/>This string would be twenty or thirty feet long, but the woman would have it all on in a jiffy; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had several on, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would press a lever, and a stream of sausage meat would be shot out, taking the casing with it as it came.
<p/>In front was a big pan which caught these creatures, and two more women who seized them as fast as they appeared and twisted them into links.
<p/>This was for the uninitiated the most perplexing work of all; for all that the woman had to give was a single turn of the wrist; and in some way she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) contrived to give it so that instead of an endless chain of sausages, one after another, there grew under her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands a bunch of strings,
<p/>Thus one might stand and see appear, miraculously born from the machine, a wriggling snake of sausage of incredible length. all dangling from a single center.
<p/>It was quite like the feat of a prestidigitator--for the woman worked so fast that the eye could literally not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and there was only a mist of motion, and tangle after tangle of sausages appearing.
<p/>In the midst of the mist, however, the visitor would suddenly notice the tense set face, with the two wrinkles graven in the forehead, and the ghastly pallor of the cheeks; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would suddenly recollect that it was time he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was going on.
<p/>The woman did not go on; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stayed right there--hour after hour, day after day, year after year, twisting sausage links and racing with death.
<p/>It was piecework, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was apt to have a family to keep alive; and stern and ruthless economic laws had arranged it that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could only do this by working just as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soul upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work, and with never an instant for a glance at the well-dressed ladies and gentlemen who came to stare at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), as at some wild beast in a menagerie.
<p/>With one member trimming beef in a cannery, and another working in a sausage factory, the family had a first-hand knowledge of the great majority of Packingtown swindles.
<p/>For it was the custom, as they found, whenever meat was so spoiled that it could not be used for anything else, either to can it or else to chop it up into sausage.
<p/>With what had been told them by Jonas, who had worked in the pickle rooms, they could now study the whole of the spoiled-meat industry on the inside, and read a new and grim meaning into that old Packingtown jest--that they use everything of the pig except the squeal.
<p/>Jonas had told them how the meat that was taken out of pickle would often be found sour, and how they would rub it up with soda to take away the smell, and sell it to be eaten on free-lunch counters; also of all the miracles of chemistry which they performed, giving to any sort of meat, fresh or salted, whole or chopped, any color and any flavor and any odor they chose.
<p/>In the pickling of hams they had an ingenious apparatus, by which they saved time and increased the capacity of the plant--a machine consisting of a hollow needle attached to a pump; by plunging this needle into the meat and working with his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) foot, a man could fill a ham with pickle in a few seconds.
<p/>And yet, in spite of this, there would be hams found spoiled, some of them with an odor so bad that a man could hardly bear to be in the room with them.
<p/>To pump into these the packers had a second and much stronger pickle which destroyed the odor--a process known to the workers as <div class="bookquote">``giving them thirty per cent.
<p/>Chapter 14 ''  (<font color='red'><b>the workers</b></font>)</div>Also, after the hams had been smoked, there would be found some that had gone to the bad.
<p/>Formerly these had been sold as <div class="bookquote">``Number Three Grade,''  (<font color='red'><b>some person</b></font>)</div>but later on some ingenious person had hit upon a new device, and now they would extract the bone, about which the bad part generally lay, and insert in the hole a white-hot iron.
<p/>The packers were always originating such schemes--they had what they called <div class="bookquote">``boneless hams,''  (<font color='red'><b>The packers</b></font>)</div>which were all the odds and ends of pork stuffed into casings; and <div class="bookquote">``California hams,''  (<font color='red'><b>The packers</b></font>)</div>which were the shoulders, with big knuckle joints, and nearly all the meat cut out; and fancy <div class="bookquote">``skinned hams,''  (<font color='red'><b>The packers</b></font>)</div>which were made of the oldest hogs, whose skins were so heavy and coarse that no one would buy them--that is, until they had been cooked and chopped fine and labeled <div class="bookquote">``head cheese!
<p/>After this invention there was no longer Number One, Two, and Three Grade--there was only Number One Grade. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The packers</b></font>)</div>It was only when the whole ham was spoiled that it came into the department of Elzbieta.
<p/>Cut up by the two-thousand-revolutions-a-minute flyers, and mixed with half a ton of other meat, no odor that ever was in a ham could make any difference.
<p/>There was never the least attention paid to what was cut up for sausage; there would come all the way back from Europe old sausage that had been rejected, and that was moldy and white--it would be dosed with borax and glycerine, and dumped into the hoppers, and made over again for home consumption.
<p/>There would be meat that had tumbled out on the floor, in the dirt and sawdust, where the workers had tramped and spit uncounted billions of consumption germs.
<p/>There would be meat stored in great piles in rooms; and the water from leaky roofs would drip over it, and thousands of rats would race about on it.
<p/>It was too dark in these storage places to see well, but a man could run his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand over these piles of meat and sweep off handfuls of the dried dung of rats.
<p/>These rats were nuisances, and the packers would put poisoned bread out for them; they would die, and then rats, bread, and meat would go into the hoppers together.
<p/>This is no fairy story and no joke; the meat would be shoveled into carts, and the man who did the shoveling would not trouble to lift out a rat even when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw one--there were things that went into the sausage in comparison with which a poisoned rat was a tidbit.
<p/>There was no place for the men to wash their hands before they ate their dinner, and so they made a practice of washing them in the water that was to be ladled into the sausage.
<p/>There were the butt-ends of smoked meat, and the scraps of corned beef, and all the odds and ends of the waste of the plants, that would be dumped into old barrels in the cellar and left there.
<p/>Under the system of rigid economy which the packers enforced, there were some jobs that it only paid to do once in a long time, and among these was the cleaning out of the waste barrels.
<p/>Every spring they did it; and in the barrels would be dirt and rust and old nails and stale water--and cartload after cartload of it would be taken up and dumped into the hoppers with fresh meat, and sent out to the public's breakfast.
<p/>Some of it they would make into <div class="bookquote">``smoked''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sausage--but as the smoking took time, and was therefore expensive, they would call upon their chemistry department, and preserve it with borax and color it with gelatine to make it brown.
<p/>All of their sausage came out of the same bowl, but when they came to wrap it they would stamp some of it <div class="bookquote">``special,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and for this they would charge two cents more a pound.
<p/>Such were the new surroundings in which Elzbieta was placed, and such was the work she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was compelled to do. It was stupefying, brutalizing work; it left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) no time to think, no strength for anything.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was part of the machine she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) tended, and every faculty that was not needed for the machine was doomed to be crushed out of existence.
<p/>There was only one mercy about the cruel grind--that it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) the gift of insensibility. Little by little she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) sank into a torpor--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) fell silent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) would meet Jurgis and Ona in the evening, and the three would walk home together, often without saying a word.
<p/>Ona, too, was falling into a habit of silence-- Ona, who had once gone about singing like a bird. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was sick and miserable, and often she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would barely have strength enough to drag herself home.
<p/>And there they would eat what they had to eat, and afterward, because there was only their misery to talk of, they would crawl into bed and fall into a stupor and never stir until it was time to get up again, and dress by candlelight, and go back to the machines.
<p/>They were so numbed that they did not even suffer much from hunger, now; only the children continued to fret when the food ran short.
<p/>Yet the soul of Ona was not dead--the souls of none of them were dead, but only sleeping; and now and then they would waken, and these were cruel times.
<p/>The gates of memory would roll open--old joys would stretch out their arms to them, old hopes and dreams would call to them, and they would stir beneath the burden that lay upon them, and feel its forever immeasurable weight.
<p/>It was a thing scarcely to be spoken--a thing never spoken by all the world, that will not know its own defeat.
<p/>They could not even cry out beneath it; but anguish would seize them, more dreadful than the agony of death. They were beaten; they had lost the game, they were swept aside.
<p/>It was not less tragic because it was so sordid, because it had to do with wages and grocery bills and rents.
<p/>They had dreamed of freedom; of a chance to look about them and learn something; to be decent and clean, to see their child grow up to be strong.
<p/>Six years more of toil they had to face before they could expect the least respite, the cessation of the payments upon the house; and
<p/>And now it was all gone--it would never be! They had played the game and they had lost. how cruelly certain it was that they could never stand six years of such a life as they were living!
<p/>They were lost, they were going down--and there was no deliverance for them, no hope; for all the help it gave them the vast city in which they lived might have been an ocean waste, a wilderness, a desert, a tomb.
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would lie, afraid of the beating of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own heart, fronting the blood-red eyes of the old primeval terror of life.
<p/>So often this mood would come to Ona, in the nighttime, when something wakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) cried aloud, and woke Jurgis, who was tired and cross.
<p/>After that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) learned to weep silently--their moods so seldom came together now! It was as if their hopes were buried in separate graves.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had never spoken of it, nor would he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) allow any one else to speak of it--he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had never acknowledged its existence to himself.
<p/>Jurgis, being a man, had troubles of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own. There was another specter following him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Yet the battle with it took all the manhood that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had--and once or twice, alas, a little more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was working in the steaming pit of hell; day after day, week after week--until now, there was not an organ of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body that did its work without pain, until the sound of ocean breakers echoed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head day and night, and the buildings swayed and danced before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went down the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could forget the pain, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could slip off the burden; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would see clearly again, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be master of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dead self would stir in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would find himself laughing and cracking jokes with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companions--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be a man again, and master of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>Jurgis had discovered drink. And from all the unending horror of this there was a respite, a deliverance--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could drink! It was not an easy thing for Jurgis to take more than two or three drinks.
<p/>With the first drink he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could eat a meal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could persuade himself that that was economy; with the second he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could eat another meal--but there would come a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could eat no more, and then to pay for a drink was an unthinkable extravagance, a defiance of the age-long instincts of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hunger-haunted class.
<p/>One day, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the plunge, and drank up all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets, and went home half <div class="bookquote">``piped,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the men phrase it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was happier than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been in a year; and yet, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that the happiness would not last, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was savage, too with those who would wreck it, and with the world, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life; and then again, beneath this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was sick with the shame of himself.
<p/>Afterward, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw the despair of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, and reckoned up the money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spent, the tears came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began the long battle with the specter.
<p/>It was a battle that had no end, that never could have one. But Jurgis did not realize that very clearly; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not given much time for reflection.
<p/>Steeped in misery and despair as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, merely to walk down the street was to be put upon the rack.
<p/>There was surely a saloon on the corner--perhaps on all four corners, and some in the middle of the block as well; and each one stretched out a hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
<p/>Going and coming--before sunrise and after dark--there was warmth and a glow of light, and the steam of hot food, and perhaps music, or a friendly face, and a word of good cheer.
<p/>Jurgis developed a fondness for having Ona on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went out on the street, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) tightly, and walk fast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) simply knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always fighting. each one had a personality of its own, allurements unlike any other. It was pitiful to have Ona know of this
<p/>--it drove him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wild to think of it; the thing was not fair, for Ona had never tasted drink, and so could not understand.
<p/>Sometimes, in desperate hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would find himself wishing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) might learn what it was, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) need not be ashamed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) presence.
<p/>So there came a time when nearly all the conscious life of Jurgis consisted of a struggle with the craving for liquor.
<p/>They might drink together, and escape from the horror--escape for a while, come what would. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have ugly moods, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated Ona and the whole family, because they stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way.
<p/>It was all because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a married man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was compelled to stay in the yards; if it had not been for that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have gone off like Jonas, and to hell with the packers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) was a fool to have married; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) had tied himself down, had made himself a slave. There were few single men in the fertilizer mill--and those few were working only for a chance to escape.
<p/>Meantime, too, they had something to think about while they worked,--they had the memory of the last time they had been drunk, and the hope of the time when they would be drunk again.
<p/>As for Jurgis, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) was expected to bring home every penny; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) could not even go with the men at noontime--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) was supposed to sit down and eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) dinner on a pile of fertilizer dust.
<p/>This was not always his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) mood, of course; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) still loved his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) family. But just now was a time of trial.
<p/>Poor little Antanas, for instance--who had never failed to win him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) with a smile--little Antanas was not smiling just now, being a mass of fiery red pimples.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had had all the diseases that babies are heir to, in quick succession, scarlet fever, mumps, and whooping cough in the first year, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was down with the measles.
<p/>but Kotrina; there was no doctor to help him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), because they were too poor, and children did not die of the measles--at least not often.
<p/>Now and then Kotrina would find time to sob over his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) woes, but for the greater part of the time he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had to be left alone, barricaded upon the bed.
<p/>There was no one to attend him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) The floor was full of drafts, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) caught cold he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would die.
<p/>At night he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was tied down, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) should kick the covers off him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), while the family lay in their stupor of exhaustion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would lie and scream for hours, almost in convulsions; and then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was worn out, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would lie whimpering and wailing in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) torment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was burning up with fever, and his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) eyes were running sores; in the daytime he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was a thing uncanny and impish to behold, a plaster of pimples and sweat, a great purple lump of misery.
<p/>Yet all this was not really as cruel as it sounds, for, sick as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was, little Antanas was the least unfortunate member of that family.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was quite able to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) sufferings--it was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had all these complaints to show what a prodigy of health he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was the child of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) parents' youth and joy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) grew up like the conjurer's rosebush, and all the world was his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) oyster.
<p/>In general, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) toddled around the kitchen all day with a lean and hungry look--the portion of the family's allowance that fell to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was not enough, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was unrestrainable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) demand for more.
<p/>It seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had taken all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) mother's strength--had left nothing for those that might come after him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>).
<p/>Ona was with child again now, and it was a dreadful thing to contemplate; even Jurgis, dumb and despairing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was, could not but understand that yet other agonies were on the way, and shudder at the thought of them.
<p/>Antanas was but little over a year old, and already no one but his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) father could manage him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>). For Ona was visibly going to pieces.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had had a trace of it ever since that fatal morning when the greedy streetcar corporation had turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) out into the rain; but now it was beginning to grow serious, and to wake her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) up at night.
<p/>Even worse than that was the fearful nervousness from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) suffered; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would have frightful headaches and fits of aimless weeping; and sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would come home at night shuddering and moaning, and would fling herself down upon the bed and burst into tears.
<p/>In the first place she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was developing a cough, like the one that had killed old Dede Antanas. Several times she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was quite beside herself and hysterical; and then Jurgis would go half-mad with fright.
<p/>Elzbieta would explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) that it could not be helped, that a woman was subject to such things when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was pregnant; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was hardly to be persuaded, and would beg and plead to know what had happened.
<p/>It was the life she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had to live, the accursed work she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had to do, that was killing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by inches.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not fitted for it--no woman was fitted for it, no woman ought to be allowed to do such work; if the world could not keep them alive any other way it ought to kill them at once and be done with it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had never been like this before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would argue--it was monstrous and unthinkable. They ought not to marry, to have children; no workingman ought to marry--
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would carry on, becoming half hysterical himself, which was an unbearable thing to see in a big man; Ona would pull herself together and fling herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, begging him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to stop, to be still, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would be better, it would be all right.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would lie and sob out her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) grief upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), as helpless as a wounded animal, the target of unseen enemies.
<p/>if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Jurgis, had known what a woman was like, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes torn out first. Chapter 15
<p/>The beginning of these perplexing things was in the summer; and each time Ona would promise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with terror in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) voice that it would not happen again--but in vain.
<p/>Each crisis would leave Jurgis more and more frightened, more disposed to distrust Elzbieta's consolations, and to believe that there was some terrible thing about all this that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not allowed to know.
<p/>Once or twice in these outbreaks he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught Ona's eye, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like the eye of a hunted animal; there were broken phrases of anguish and despair now and then, amid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) frantic weeping.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never thought of it, except when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was dragged to it--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived like a dumb beast of burden, knowing only the moment in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was.
<p/>It was only because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so numb and beaten himself that Jurgis did not worry more about this. The winter was coming on again, more menacing and cruel than ever.
<p/>It was necessary for the packing machines to grind till late at night to provide food that would be eaten at Christmas breakfasts; and Marija and Elzbieta and Ona, as part of the machine, began working fifteen or sixteen hours a day.
<p/>It was October, and the holiday rush had begun. There was no choice about this-- whatever work there was to be done
<p/>they had to do, if they wished to keep their places; besides that, it added another pittance to their incomes. So they staggered on with the awful load.
<p/>They would start work every morning at seven, and eat their dinners at noon, and then work until ten or eleven at night without another mouthful of food.
<p/>Jurgis wanted to wait for them, to help them home at night, but they would not think of this; the fertilizer mill was not running overtime, and there was no place for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) to wait save in a saloon.
<p/>Each would stagger out into the darkness, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) way to the corner, where they met; or if the others had already gone, would get into a car, and begin a painful struggle to keep awake.
<p/>When they got home they were always too tired either to eat or to undress; they would crawl into bed with their shoes on, and lie like logs.
<p/>If they should fail, they would certainly be lost; if they held out, they might have enough coal for the winter.
<p/>A day or two before Thanksgiving Day there came a snowstorm. It began in the afternoon, and by evening two inches had fallen.
<p/>Jurgis tried to wait for the women, but went into a saloon to get warm, and took two drinks, and came out and ran home to escape from the demon; there he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) lay down to wait for them, and instantly fell asleep.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) eyes again he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) was in the midst of a nightmare, and found Elzbieta shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) and crying out.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) could not realize what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was saying--Ona had not come home. What time was it, he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) asked. It was morning--time to be up.
<p/>Ona had not been home that night! And it was bitter cold, and a foot of snow on the ground. Jurgis sat up with a start.
<p/>Marija was crying with fright and the children were wailing in sympathy--little Stanislovas in addition, because the terror of the snow was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>).
<p/>Jurgis had nothing to put on but his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) shoes and his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) coat, and in half a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) was out of the door.
<p/>Then, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) realized that there was no need of haste, that he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) had no idea where to go. It was still dark as midnight, and the thick snowflakes were sifting down
<p/>--everything was so silent that he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) could hear the rustle of them as they fell. In the few seconds that he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) stood there hesitating he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) was covered white.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) set off at a run for the yards, stopping by the way to inquire in the saloons that were open.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) got to the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) worked he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) inquired of one of the watchmen--there had not been any accident, so far as the man had heard.
<p/>At the time office, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found already open, the clerk told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that Ona's check had been turned in the night before, showing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) work.
<p/>After that there was nothing for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do but wait, pacing back and forth in the snow, meantime, to keep from freezing.
<p/>Already the yards were full of activity; cattle were being unloaded from the cars in the distance, and across the way the <div class="bookquote">``beef-luggers''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were toiling in the darkness, carrying two-hundred-pound quarters of bullocks into the refrigerator cars.
<p/>Before the first streaks of daylight there came the crowding throngs of workingmen, shivering, and swinging their dinner pails as they hurried by.
<p/>Jurgis took up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stand by the time-office window, where alone there was light enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to see; the snow fell so quick that it was only by peering closely that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could make sure that Ona did not pass him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Ona might have been overcome on the way; or else she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) might have met with an accident in the machines. Seven o'clock came, the hour when the great packing machine began to move.
<p/>Jurgis ought to have been at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place in the fertilizer mill; but instead he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was waiting, in an agony of fear, for Ona.
<p/>It was fifteen minutes after the hour when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw a form emerge from the snow mist, and sprang toward it with a cry.
<p/>It was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), running swiftly; as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) staggered forward, and half fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outstretched arms. '' What has been the matter?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, anxiously. '' Where have you been? '' It was several seconds before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) could get breath to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' I couldn't get home,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) exclaimed. '' The snow--the cars had stopped.'' '' But where were you then?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) demanded.
<p/>Jurgis drew a deep breath; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was sobbing and trembling--as if in one of those nervous crises that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreaded so.
<p/>'' I had to go home with a friend,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) panted--<div class="bookquote">``with Jadvyga. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' But what's the matter? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' What has happened?'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jurgis, I was so frightened! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) said, clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wildly. '' I have been so worried!
<p/>'' They were near the time station window, and people were staring at them. Jurgis led her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) away. '' How do you mean?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked, in perplexity. '' I was afraid-- I was just afraid! '' sobbed Ona. '' I knew you wouldn't know where I was, and I didn't know what you might do.
<p/>I tried to get home, but I was so tired. Oh, Jurgis, Jurgis! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so glad to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) back that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not think clearly about anything else.
<p/>It did not seem strange to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) should be so very much upset; all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) fright and incoherent protestations did not matter since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) back.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) cry away her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) tears; and then, because it was nearly eight o'clock, and they would lose another hour if they delayed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) at the packing house door, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) ghastly white face and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) haunted eyes of terror.
<p/>Christmas was almost come; and because the snow still held, and the searching cold, morning after morning Jurgis half carried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) post, staggering with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) through the darkness; until at last, one night, came the end.
<p/>There was another brief interval. It lacked but three days of the holidays. About midnight Marija and Elzbieta came home, exclaiming in alarm when they found that Ona had not come.
<p/>The two had agreed to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>); and, after waiting, had gone to the room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) worked; only to find that the ham-wrapping girls had quit work an hour before, and left.
<p/>There was no snow that night, nor was it especially cold; and still Ona had not come! Something more serious must be wrong this time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) must have gone home again with Jadvyga, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) said; Jadvyga lived only two blocks from the yards, and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had been tired.
<p/>They aroused Jurgis, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) sat up and listened crossly to the story. Nothing could have happened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)--and even if there had, there was nothing could be done about it until morning.
<p/>Jurgis turned over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) bed, and was snoring again before the two had closed the door. In the morning, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was up and out nearly an hour before the usual time.
<p/>Jadvyga Marcinkus lived on the other side of the yards, beyond Halsted Street, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) mother and sisters, in a single basement room--for Mikolas had recently lost one hand from blood poisoning, and their marriage had been put off forever.
<p/>The door of the room was in the rear, reached by a narrow court, and Jurgis saw a light in the window and heard something frying as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) passed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) knocked, half expecting that Ona would answer.
<p/>Instead there was one of Jadvyga's little sisters, who gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) through a crack in the door. '' Where's Ona?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) demanded; and the child looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) in perplexity. '' Ona?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) said. '' Yes,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``isn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No,'' said the child, and Jurgis gave a start. A moment later came Jadvyga, peering over the child's head. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) saw who it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) slid around out of sight, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was not quite dressed.
<p/>Jurgis must excuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) began, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) mother was very ill-- '' Ona isn't here?'' Jurgis demanded, too alarmed to wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) to finish.
<p/>'' Why, no,'' said Jadvyga. '' What made you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would be here? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was coming?'' ''
<p/>No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) answered. '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hasn't come home--and I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would be here the same as before. '' ''
<p/>As before?'' echoed Jadvyga, in perplexity. '' The time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) spent the night here,'' said Jurgis. '' There must be some mistake,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) answered, quickly.
<p/>'' Ona has never spent the night here. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was only half able to realize the words. '' Why--why--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) exclaimed.
<p/>'' Two weeks ago. Jadvyga! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) told me so the night it snowed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) could not get home.'' <div class="bookquote">``There must be some mistake,''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>declared the girl, again; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't come here.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) steadied himself by the door-sill; and Jadvyga in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) anxiety--for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was fond of Ona--opened the door wide, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) jacket across her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) throat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>'' Are you sure you didn't misunderstand her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) cried. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) must have meant somewhere else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)--'' ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) said here,'' insisted Jurgis. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) told me all about you, and how you were, and what you said. Are you sure?
<p/>You haven't forgotten? You weren't away?'' <div class="bookquote">``No, no! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) exclaimed--and then came a peevish voice--<div class="bookquote">``Jadvyga, you are giving the baby a cold.
<p/>Jurgis stood for half a minute more, stammering his (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) perplexity through an eighth of an inch of crack; and then, as there was really nothing more to be said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) excused himself and went away.
<p/>Shut the door!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) walked on half dazed, without knowing where he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) went. Ona had deceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had lied to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) could hardly grasp the thing--much less try to solve it; but a hundred wild surmises came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), a sense of impending calamity overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>And what could it mean--where had she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) been? Where was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) now? Because there was nothing else to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) went back to the time office to watch again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) waited until nearly an hour after seven, and then went to the room where Ona worked to make inquiries of Ona's ``forelady.
<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``forelady,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) found, had not yet come; all the lines of cars that came from downtown were stalled--there had been an accident in the powerhouse, and no cars had been running since last night.
<p/>'' Meantime, however, the ham-wrappers were working away, with some one else in charge of them. The girl who answered Jurgis was busy, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) talked she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were being watched.
<p/>Then a man came up, wheeling a truck; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew Jurgis for Ona's husband, and was curious about the mystery. ''
<p/>Maybe the cars had something to do with it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suggested--<div class="bookquote">``maybe she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had gone down-town.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) never went down-town.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps not,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. Jurgis thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) exchange a swift glance with the girl as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) demanded quickly.
<p/>'' What do you know about it? '' But the man had seen that the boss was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) started on again, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) truck.
<p/>'' I don't know anything about it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) said, over his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) shoulder. '' How should I know where your wife goes?
<p/>'' Then Jurgis went out again and paced up and down before the building. All the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) stayed there, with no thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) work.
<p/>About noon he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) went to the police station to make inquiries, and then came back again for another anxious vigil. Finally, toward the middle of the afternoon, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) set out for home once more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was walking out Ashland Avenue. The streetcars had begun running again, and several passed him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>), packed to the steps with people.
<p/>The sight of them set Jurgis to thinking again of the man's sarcastic remark; and half involuntarily he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found himself watching the cars--with the result that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave a sudden startled exclamation, and stopped short in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tracks.
<p/>That rusty black hat with the drooping red flower, it might not be Ona's, but there was very little likelihood of it.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broke into a run. For a whole block he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tore after the car, only a little ways behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would know for certain very soon, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would get out two blocks ahead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slowed down, and let the car go on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) got out: and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was out of sight on the side street
<p/>: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) turn the corner near their home, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran again, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) went up the porch steps of the house.
<p/>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned back, and for five minutes paced up and down, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands clenched tightly and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips set, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind in a turmoil.
<p/>Jurgis broke into a run. Suspicion was rife in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not ashamed to shadow her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went home and entered.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw Elzbieta, who had also been looking for Ona, and had come home again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was now on tiptoe, and had a finger on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) lips.
<p/>Jurgis waited until she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was close to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' Don't make any noise,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) whispered, hurriedly. '' What's the matter'? ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked. '' Ona is asleep,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) panted. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)'s been very ill. I'm afraid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) mind's been wandering, Jurgis. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was lost on the street all night, and I've only just succeeded in getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) quiet.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``When did she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) come in? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked. '' Soon after you left this morning,'' said Elzbieta. '' And has she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) been out since?''
<p/>'' No, of course not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>)'s so weak, Jurgis, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>)-- '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teeth hard together. '' You are lying to me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/>Elzbieta started, and turned pale. <div class="bookquote">``Why!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) gasped. '' What do you mean? '' But Jurgis did not answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) aside, and strode to the bedroom door and opened it.
<p/>Ona was sitting on the bed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) turned a startled look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) closed the door in Elzbieta's face, and went toward his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) hands clasped tightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) lap, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) face was as white as paper, and drawn with pain.
<p/>'' Where have you been? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) demanded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) gasped once or twice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) tried to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and then began, speaking low, and swiftly.
<p/>'' Jurgis, I--I think I have been out of my mind. I started to come last night, and I could not find the way.
<p/>I walked --I walked all night, I think, and--and I only got home--this morning.'' <div class="bookquote">``You needed a rest,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, in a hard tone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) fairly in the face, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could read the sudden fear and wild uncertainty that leaped into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Why did you go out again? '' '' I--I had to go to--to the store,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) gasped, almost in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">``I had to go--''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are lying to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Jurgis. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and took a step toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>). '' Why do you lie to me?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, fiercely. '' What are you doing that you have to lie to me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Jurgis!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) exclaimed, starting up in fright.
<p/>'' Oh, Jurgis, how can you?'' <div class="bookquote">``You have lied to me, I say! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried. '' You told me you had been to Jadvyga's house that other night, and you hadn't.
<p/>You had been where you were last night--somewheres downtown, for I saw you get off the car. Where were you? ''
<p/>For half a second she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) stood, reeling and swaying, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with horror in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) eyes; then, with a cry of anguish, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) tottered forward, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>It was as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had struck a knife into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) seemed to go all to pieces. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped aside, deliberately, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) fall.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) caught herself at the side of the bed, and then sank down, burying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) hands and bursting into frantic weeping.
<p/>There came one of those hysterical crises that had so often dismayed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Ona sobbed and wept, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) fear and anguish building themselves up into long climaxes.
<p/>Furious gusts of emotion would come sweeping over her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) as the tempest shakes the trees upon the hills; all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) frame would quiver and throb with them--it was as if some dreadful thing rose up within her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and took possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), torturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), tearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>This thing had been wont to set Jurgis quite beside himself; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips set tightly and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands clenched--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) might weep till she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) killed herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) should not move him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) this time--not an inch, not an inch.
<p/>Because the sounds she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) made set his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blood to running cold and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips to quivering in spite of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was glad of the diversion when Teta Elzbieta, pale with fright, opened the door and rushed in; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) with an oath.
<p/>And then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) stood hesitating, about to speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) by the arm, and half flung her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) from the room, slamming the door and barring it with a table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go out! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``go out! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned again and faced Ona, crying--<div class="bookquote">``Now, answer me!''  (<font color='red'><b>Ona/Little Ona</b></font>)</div>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) did not hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was still in the grip of the fiend.
<p/>Jurgis could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) outstretched hands, shaking and twitching, roaming here and there over the bed at will, like living things; he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) could see convulsive shudderings start in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) body and run through her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) limbs.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was sobbing and choking--it was as if there were too many sounds for one throat, they came chasing each other, like waves upon the sea.
<p/>Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) voice would begin to rise into screams, louder and louder until it broke in wild, horrible peals of laughter.
<p/>Jurgis bore it until he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) could bear it no longer, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) sprang at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) by the shoulders and shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), shouting into her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) ear:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop it, I say! Stop it!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>), out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) agony; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) fell forward at his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) feet.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) caught them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hands, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) efforts to step aside, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) face upon the floor lay writhing.
<p/>It made a choking in Jurgis' throat to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) cried again, more savagely than before: <div class="bookquote">``Stop it, I say!
<p/>This time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) heeded him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>), and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) breath and lay silent, save for the gasping sobs that wrenched all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) frame.
<p/>For a long minute she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) lay there, perfectly motionless, until a cold fear seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) husband, thinking that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was dying.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Suddenly, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) voice, faintly: <div class="bookquote">``Jurgis! Jurgis! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What is it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had to bend down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was so weak.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was pleading with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), in broken phrases, painfully uttered: <div class="bookquote">``Have faith in me! Believe me!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Believe what?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cried. ''
<p/>Believe that I--that I know best--that I love you! And do not ask me--what you did. Oh, Jurgis, please, please! It is for the best--
<p/>it is-- '' He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) started to speak again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) rushed on frantically, heading him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) off. '' If you will only do it!
<p/>If you will only--only believe me! It wasn't my fault-- I couldn't help it--it will be all right --it is nothing--it is no harm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had hold of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and was trying to raise herself to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could feel the palsied shaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hands and the heaving of the bosom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) pressed against him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) managed to catch one of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hands and gripped it convulsively, drawing it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) face, and bathing it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) tears.
<p/>Oh, Jurgis--please, please!'' '' Oh, believe me, believe me! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) wailed again; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) shouted in fury, <div class="bookquote">``I will not!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But still she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), wailing aloud in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) despair: <div class="bookquote">``Oh, Jurgis, think what you are doing! It will ruin us--it will ruin us!
<p/>Oh, no, you must not do it! No, don't, don't do it. You must not do it! It will drive me mad--it will kill me--no, no, Jurgis, I am crazy--it is nothing.
<p/>You do not really need to know. We can be happy--we can love each other just the same. Oh, please, please, believe me!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) words fairly drove him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wild. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) tore his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hands loose, and flung her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) off. '' Answer me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' God damn it, I say--answer me!'' She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sank down upon the floor, beginning to cry again. It was like listening to the moan of a damned soul, and Jurgis could not stand it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) smote his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fist upon the table by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) side, and shouted again at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Answer me!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) began to scream aloud, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) voice like the voice of some wild beast: <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>Ah! I can't! I can't do it!''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why can't you do it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shouted. '' I don't know how!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sprang and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) by the arm, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) up, and glaring into her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) face.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me where you were last night! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) panted. '' Quick, out with it!'' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) began to whisper, one word at a time: <div class="bookquote">``I--was in--a house--downtown--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What house?
<p/>What do you mean? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) tried to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). '' Miss Henderson's house,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) gasped.
<p/>And then suddenly, as in an explosion, the horrible truth burst over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) reeled and staggered back with a scream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not understand at first. '' Miss Henderson's house,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) echoed. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) caught himself against the wall, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forehead, staring about him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and whispering, <div class="bookquote">``Jesus!
<p/>Jesus! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>An instant later he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) leaped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) lay groveling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) by the throat.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) tried to get away, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) furious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) thought it was fear, of the pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) clutch--he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) did not understand that it was the agony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) shame.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) gasped, hoarsely. '' Quick! Who took you to that place?'' Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Connor.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Connor,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) gasped.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) tightened his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) grip, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) frenzy, and only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) eyes closing did he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) was choking her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>).
<p/>'' Who is Connor?'' <div class="bookquote">``The boss,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) answered. '' The man-- Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) fingers, and crouched, waiting, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) lids again.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) breath beat hot into her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) whispered, at last, <div class="bookquote">``tell me about it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) lay perfectly motionless, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) had to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) breath to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) words.
<p/>'' I did not want--to do it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``I tried--I tried not to do it. I only did it--to save us.
<p/>It was our only chance. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Again, for a space, there was no sound but his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) panting. Ona's eyes closed and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) spoke again she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) did not open them.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) told me--he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) would have me turned off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) would--we would all of us lose our places.
<p/>Jurgis' arms were shaking so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) could scarcely hold himself up, and lurched forward now and then as he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) listened.
<p/>We could never get anything to do--here--again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) meant it--he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) would have ruined us. '' '' When--when did this begin? ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) gasped. '' At the very first,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) spoke as if in a trance. '' It was all--it was their plot--Miss Henderson's plot.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) hated me. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) wanted me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) used to speak to me--out on the platform. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) began to--to make love to me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) offered me money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) begged me--he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) loved me. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) threatened me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) knew all about us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) knew we would starve.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) knew your boss--he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) knew Marija's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) would hound us to death, he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) said--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) said if I would--if I-- we would all of us be sure of work--always.
<p/>Then one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) caught hold of me--he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) would not let go--he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>)-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Where was this?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``In the hallway--at night--after every one had gone.
<p/>I could not help it. I thought of you--of the baby--of mother and the children. I was afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>)--afraid to cry out.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A moment ago her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face had been ashen gray, now it was scarlet. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was beginning to breathe hard again.
<p/>Jurgis made not a sound. '' That was two months ago. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) wanted me to come--to that house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) wanted me to stay there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) said all of us--that we would not have to work. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) made me come there--in the evenings. I told you--
<p/>you thought I was at the factory. Then--one night it snowed, and I couldn't get back. And last night--the cars were stopped.
<p/>It was such a little thing--to ruin us all. I tried to walk, but I couldn't. I didn't want you to know.
<p/>It would have--it would have been all right. We could have gone on--just the same--you need never have known about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was getting tired of me--he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) would have let me alone soon. I am going to have a baby--I am getting ugly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) told me that--twice, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) told me, last night. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) kicked me--last night--too. And now you will kill him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)-- you--you will kill him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>)--and we shall die.
<p/>'' All this she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had said without a quiver; she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) lay still as death, not an eyelid moving. And Jurgis, too, said not a word.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) lifted himself by the bed, and stood up. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) did not stop for another glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), but went to the door and opened it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) did not see Elzbieta, crouching terrified in the corner. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) went out, hatless, leaving the street door open behind him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>).
<p/>The instant his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) feet were on the sidewalk he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) broke into a run. He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) ran like one possessed, blindly, furiously, looking neither to the right nor left.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was on Ashland Avenue before exhaustion compelled him (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) to slow down, and then, noticing a car, he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) made a dart for it and drew himself aboard.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) eyes were wild and his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hair flying, and he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was breathing hoarsely, like a wounded bull; but the people on the car did not notice this particularly--perhaps it seemed natural to them that a man who smelled as Jurgis smelled should exhibit an aspect to correspond.
<p/>The conductor took his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) nickel gingerly, with the tips of his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) fingers, and then left him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) with the platform to himself.
<p/>They began to give way before him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) as usual. Jurgis did not even notice it--his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) thoughts were far away. Within his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) soul it was like a roaring furnace; he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) stood waiting, waiting, crouching as if for a spring.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) had some of his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) breath back when the car came to the entrance of the yards, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) leaped off and started again, racing at full speed.
<p/>People turned and stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) saw no one--there was the factory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) bounded through the doorway and down the corridor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) knew the room where Ona worked, and he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) knew Connor, the boss of the loading-gang outside. He (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) looked for the man as he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) sprang into the room.
<p/>The truckmen were hard at work, loading the freshly packed boxes and barrels upon the cars. Jurgis shot one swift glance up and down the platform--the man was not on it.
<p/>But then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard a voice in the corridor, and started for it with a bound. In an instant more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fronted the boss.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a big, red-faced Irishman, coarse-featured, and smelling of liquor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) saw Jurgis as he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) crossed the threshold, and turned white.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) put up his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) hands to protect his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) face, but Jurgis, lunging with all the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) arm and body, struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) fairly between the eyes and knocked him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) backward.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) hesitated one second, as if meaning to run; and in the next his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) assailant was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>). The next moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) was on top of him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>), burying his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) fingers in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) throat.
<p/>To Jurgis this man's whole presence reeked of the crime he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) had committed; the touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) body was madness to him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>)--it set every nerve of him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) a-tremble, it aroused all the demon in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) soul.
<p/>It had worked its will upon Ona, this great beast--and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) had it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) had it! It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) turn now!
<p/>Things swam blood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) screamed aloud in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) fury, lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) victim and smashing his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) head upon the floor.
<p/>Jurgis was so bent upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) task that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) knew nothing of this, and scarcely realized that people were trying to interfere with him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>)
<p/>; it was only when half a dozen men had seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) by the legs and shoulders and were pulling at him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) was losing his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) prey.
<p/>In a flash he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) had bent down and sunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) teeth into the man's cheek; and when they tore him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) away he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) was dripping with blood, and little ribbons of skin were hanging in his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>They got him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) down upon the floor, clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) arms and legs, and still they could hardly hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>).
<p/>The place, of course, was in an uproar; women fainting and shrieking, and men rushing in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) fought like a tiger, writhing and twisting, half flinging them off, and starting toward his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) unconscious enemy.
<p/>But yet others rushed in, until there was a little mountain of twisted limbs and bodies, heaving and tossing, and working its way about the room.
<p/>In the end, by their sheer weight, they choked the breath out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>), and then they carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) to the company police station, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) lay still until they had summoned a patrol wagon to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) away.
<p/>Chapter 16 When Jurgis got up again he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) went quietly enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) was exhausted and half-dazed, and besides he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) saw the blue uniforms of the policemen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) drove in a patrol wagon with half a dozen of them watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>); keeping as far away as possible, however, on account of the fertilizer.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) stood before the sergeant's desk and gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) name and address, and saw a charge of assault and battery entered against him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>).
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) cell a burly policeman cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) started down the wrong corridor, and then added a kick when he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) was not quick enough; nevertheless, Jurgis did not even lift his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) eyes--he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) had lived two years and a half in Packingtown, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) knew what the police were.
<p/>It was as much as a man's very life was worth to anger them, here in their inmost lair; like as not a dozen would pile on to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at once, and pound his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face into a pulp.
<p/>It would be nothing unusual if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) skull cracked in the melee--in which case they would report that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been drunk and had fallen down, and there would be no one to know the difference or to care.
<p/>So a barred door clanged upon Jurgis and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat down upon a bench and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was alone; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had the afternoon and all of the night to himself. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was like a wild beast that has glutted itself; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in a dull stupor of satisfaction.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done up the scoundrel pretty well--not as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have if they had given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a minute more, but pretty well, all the same; the ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers were still tingling from their contact with the fellow's throat.
<p/>But then, little by little, as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength came back and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses cleared, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to see beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) momentary gratification; that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had nearly killed the boss would not help Ona--not the horrors that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had borne, nor the memory that would haunt her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) days.
<p/>It would not help to feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) child; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would certainly lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--what was to happen to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) God only knew.
<p/>Half the night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paced the floor, wrestling with this nightmare; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was exhausted he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay down, trying to sleep, but finding instead, for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>At midnight they opened the station house to the homeless wanderers who were crowded about the door, shivering in the winter blast, and they thronged into the corridor outside of the cells.
<p/>Some of them stretched themselves out on the bare stone floor and fell to snoring, others sat up, laughing and talking, cursing and quarreling.
<p/>The air was fetid with their breath, yet in spite of this some of them smelled Jurgis and called down the torments of hell upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay in a far corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cell, counting the throbbings of the blood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>They had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) supper, which was <div class="bookquote">``duffers and dope'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>--being hunks of dry bread on a tin plate, and coffee, called <div class="bookquote">``dope''  (<font color='red'><b>hunks</b></font>)</div>because it was drugged to keep the prisoners quiet.
<p/>Jurgis had not known this, or he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) would have swallowed the stuff in desperation; as it was, every nerve of him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) was a-quiver with shame and rage.
<p/>Toward morning the place fell silent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) got up and began to pace his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) cell; and then within the soul of him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) there rose up a fiend, red-eyed and cruel, and tore out the strings of his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) heart.
<p/>It was not for himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) suffered--what did a man who worked in Durham's fertilizer mill care about anything that the world might do to him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>)!
<p/>What was any tyranny of prison compared with the tyranny of the past, of the thing that had happened and could not be recalled, of the memory that could never be effaced!
<p/>The horror of it drove him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) mad; he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) arms to heaven, crying out for deliverance from it--and there was no deliverance, there was no power even in heaven that could undo the past.
<p/>It was a ghost that would not drown; it followed him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>), it seized upon him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) and beat him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) to the ground.
<p/>Ah, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) could have foreseen it--but then, he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) would have foreseen it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) had not been a fool!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) smote his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) hands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) forehead, cursing himself because he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) had ever allowed Ona to work where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had, because he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) had not stood between her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and a fate which every one knew to be so common.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) should have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) away, even if it were to lie down and die of starvation in the gutters of Chicago's streets!
<p/>In the cell next to him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) was a drunken wife-beater and in the one beyond a yelling maniac. And now--oh, it could not be true; it was too monstrous, too horrible.
<p/>It was a thing that could not be faced; a new shuddering seized him (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) every time he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) tried to think of it.
<p/>There would be none for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) might pardon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), might plead with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) knees, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would never look him (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) in the face again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would never be his (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) wife again.
<p/>No, there was no bearing the load of it, there was no living under it. The shame of it would kill her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)--there could be no other deliverance, and it was best that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) should die.
<p/>This was simple and clear, and yet, with cruel inconsistency, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) escaped from this nightmare it was to suffer and cry out at the vision of Ona starving.
<p/>They had put him (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) in jail, and they would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) here a long time, years maybe. And Ona would surely not go to work again, broken and crushed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was.
<p/>And Elzbieta and Marija, too, might lose their places--if that hell fiend Connor chose to set to work to ruin them, they would all be turned out.
<p/>And even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) did not, they could not live--even if the boys left school again, they could surely not pay all the bills without him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) and Ona.
<p/>They had only a few dollars now--they had just paid the rent of the house a week ago, and that after it was two weeks overdue.
<p/>So it would be due again in a week! They would have no money to pay it then--and they would lose the house, after all their long, heartbreaking struggle.
<p/>Perhaps it was very base of Jurgis to be thinking about the house when he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) had the other unspeakable thing to fill his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) mind; yet, how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) had suffered for this house, how much they had all of them suffered!
<p/>It was their one hope of respite, as long as they lived; they had put all their money into it--and they were working people, poor people, whose money was their strength, the very substance of them, body and soul, the thing by which they lived and for lack of which they died.
<p/>And they would lose it all; they would be turned out into the streets, and have to hide in some icy garret, and live or die as best they could!
<p/>Jurgis had all the night--and all of many more nights--to think about this, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) saw the thing in its details; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lived it all, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) were there.
<p/>They would sell their furniture, and then run into debt at the stores, and then be refused credit; they would borrow a little from the Szedvilases, whose delicatessen store was tottering on the brink of ruin; the neighbors would come and help them a little--poor, sick Jadvyga would bring a few spare pennies, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) always did when people were starving, and Tamoszius Kuszleika would bring them the proceeds of a night's fiddling.
<p/>So they would struggle to hang on until he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) got out of jail--or would they know that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was in jail
<p/>Three times now the agent had warned him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would not tolerate another delay. , would they be able to find out anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)?
<p/>Would they be allowed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)--or was it to be part of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) punishment to be kept in ignorance about their fate?
<p/>Marija out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) place, little Stanislovas unable to get to work for the snow, the whole family turned out on the street.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) mind would hang upon the worst possibilities; he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) saw Ona ill and tortured, God Almighty! would they actually let them lie down in the street and die?
<p/>Jurgis had never seen any dead bodies in the streets, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) had seen people evicted and disappear, no one knew where; and though the city had a relief bureau, though there was a charity organization society in the stockyards district, in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) life there he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) had never heard of either of them.
<p/>Would there be no help even then --would they wander about in the snow till they froze? They did not advertise their activities, having more calls than they could attend to without that.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Almighty</b></font>) had another ride in the patrol wagon, along with the drunken wife-beater and the maniac, several <div class="bookquote">``plain drunks''  (<font color='red'><b>the maniac</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``saloon fighters,''  (<font color='red'><b>the maniac</b></font>)</div>a burglar, and two men who had been arrested for stealing meat from the packing houses.
<p/>In front, upon a raised platform behind a rail, sat a stout, florid-faced personage, with a nose broken out in purple blotches.
<p/>--So on until morning. Along with them he (<font color='blue'><b>burglar</b></font>) was driven into a large, white-walled room, stale-smelling and crowded. Our friend realized vaguely that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was about to be tried.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wondered what for--whether or not his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) victim might be dead, and if so, what they would do with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Hang him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), perhaps, or beat him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to death--nothing would have surprised Jurgis, who knew little of the laws.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had picked up gossip enough to have it occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that the loud-voiced man upon the bench might be the notorious Justice Callahan, about whom the people of Packingtown spoke with bated breath.
<p/>'' Pat, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) had been known before he (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) ascended the bench--had begun life as a butcher boy and a bruiser of local reputation; he (<font color='blue'><b>bruiser</b></font>) had gone into politics almost as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>bruiser</b></font>) had learned to talk, and had held two offices at once before he (<font color='blue'><b>bruiser</b></font>) was old enough to vote.
<p/>If Scully was the thumb, Pat Callahan was the first finger of the unseen hand whereby the packers held down the people of the district.
<p/>No politician in Chicago ranked higher in their confidence; he (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) had been at it a long time--had been the business agent in the city council of old Durham, the self-made merchant, way back in the early days, when the whole city of Chicago had been up at auction.
<p/>Growler'' Pat had given up holding city offices very early in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) career--caring only for party power, and giving the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) time to superintending his (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) dives and brothels.
<p/>Of late years, however, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) children were growing up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) had begun to value respectability, and had had himself made a magistrate; a position for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) was admirably fitted, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) strong conservatism and his (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) contempt for <div class="bookquote">``foreigners.
<p/>Jurgis sat gazing about the room for an hour or two; he (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) was in hopes that some one of the family would come, but in this he (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) was disappointed.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Pat'' Callahan--<div class="bookquote">``Growler ''  (<font color='red'><b>Pat Callahan lawyer</b></font>)</div>'' Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) was led before the bar, and a lawyer for the company appeared against him (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>).
<p/>Connor was under the doctor's care, the lawyer explained briefly, and if his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) Honor would hold the prisoner for a week--<div class="bookquote">``Three hundred dollars,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prisoner</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) Honor, promptly.
<p/>Have you any one to go on your bond?'' demanded the judge, and then a clerk who stood at Jurgis' elbow explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) what this meant.
<p/>Jurgis was staring from the judge to the lawyer in perplexity. '' The latter shook his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) head, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) realized what had happened the policemen were leading him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) away again.
<p/>They took him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to a room where other prisoners were waiting and here he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) stayed until court adjourned, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had another long and bitterly cold ride in a patrol wagon to the county jail, which is on the north side of the city, and nine or ten miles from the stockyards.
<p/>Then they led him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to a room and told him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) to strip for a bath; after which he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) had to walk down a long gallery, past the grated cell doors of the inmates of the jail.
<p/>This was a great event to the latter--the daily review of the new arrivals, all stark naked, and many and diverting were the comments.
<p/>Jurgis was required to stay in the bath longer than any one, in the vain hope of getting out of him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) a few of his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) phosphates and acids.
<p/>Here they searched Jurgis, leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) only his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) money, which consisted of fifteen cents. The prisoners roomed two in a cell, but that day there was one left over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was the one.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) cell was about five feet by seven in size, with a stone floor and a heavy wooden bench built into it.
<p/>The cells were in tiers, opening upon galleries. There was no window--the only light came from windows near the roof at one end of the court outside.
<p/>There were two bunks, one above the other, each with a straw mattress and a pair of gray blankets--the latter stiff as boards with filth, and alive with fleas, bedbugs, and lice.
<p/>When Jurgis lifted up the mattress he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) discovered beneath it a layer of scurrying roaches, almost as badly frightened as himself.
<p/>Here they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) more <div class="bookquote">``duffers and dope,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>with the addition of a bowl of soup. Many of the prisoners had their meals brought in from a restaurant, but Jurgis had no money for that.
<p/>Some had books to read and cards to play, with candles to burn by night, but Jurgis was all alone in darkness and silence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) could not sleep again; there was the same maddening procession of thoughts that lashed him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) like whips upon his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) naked back.
<p/>When night fell he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) was pacing up and down his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) cell like a wild beast that breaks its teeth upon the bars of its cage.
<p/>Now and then in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) frenzy he (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) would fling himself against the walls of the place, beating his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) hands upon them.
<p/>They cut him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) and bruised him (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>)--they were cold and merciless as the men who had built them. In the distance there was a church-tower bell that tolled the hours one by one.
<p/>When it came to midnight Jurgis was lying upon the floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) arms, listening. Instead of falling silent at the end, the bell broke into a sudden clangor.
<p/>Jurgis raised his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) head; what could that mean--a fire? God! Suppose there were to be a fire in this jail! But then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made out a melody in the ringing; there were chimes.
<p/>And they seemed to waken the city--all around, far and near, there were bells, ringing wild music; for fully a minute Jurgis lay lost in wonder, before, all at once, the meaning of it broke over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--that this was Christmas Eve!
<p/>Christmas Eve--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had forgotten it entirely! There was a breaking of floodgates, a whirl of new memories and new griefs rushing into his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mind.
<p/>In far Lithuania they had celebrated Christmas; and it came to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as if it had been yesterday--himself a little child, with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) lost brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dead father in the cabin--in the deep black forest, where the snow fell all day and all night and buried them from the world.
<p/>It was too far off for Santa Claus in Lithuania, but it was not too far for peace and good will to men, for the wonder-bearing vision of the Christ Child.
<p/>Last Christmas Eve and all Christmas Day Jurgis had toiled on the killing beds, and Ona at wrapping hams, and still they had found strength enough to take the children for a walk upon the avenue, to see the store windows all decorated with Christmas trees and ablaze with electric lights.
<p/>And even in Packingtown they had not forgotten it--some gleam of it had never failed to break their darkness. In one window there would be live geese, in another marvels in sugar--
<p/>pink and white canes big enough for ogres, and cakes with cherubs upon them; in a third there would be rows of fat yellow turkeys, decorated with rosettes, and rabbits and squirrels hanging; in a fourth would be a fairyland of toys--lovely dolls with pink dresses, and woolly sheep and drums and soldier hats.
<p/>The last time they had had a big basket with them and all their Christmas marketing to do--a roast of pork and a cabbage and some rye bread, and a pair of mittens for Ona, and a rubber doll that squeaked, and a little green cornucopia full of candy to be hung from the gas jet and gazed at by half a dozen pairs of longing eyes.
<p/>Even half a year of the sausage machines and the fertilizer mill had not been able to kill the thought of Christmas in them; there was a choking in Jurgis' throat as he (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) recalled that the very night Ona had not come home
<p/>Teta Elzbieta had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) aside and shown him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) an old valentine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had picked up in a paper store for three cents--dingy and shopworn, but with bright colors, and figures of angels and doves.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had wiped all the specks off this, and was going to set it on the mantel, where the children could see it.
<p/>Nor did they have to go without their share of all this, either. Great sobs shook Jurgis at this memory--they would spend their Christmas in misery and despair, with him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) in prison and
<p/>Why at least had they not left him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) alone--why, after they had shut him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) in jail, must they be ringing Christmas chimes in his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) ears!
<p/>But no, their bells were not ringing for him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>)--their Christmas was not meant for him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>), they were simply not counting him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) at all.
<p/>Ona ill and their home in desolation. Ah, it was too cruel! He (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) was of no consequence--he (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) was flung aside, like a bit of trash, the carcass of some animal.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) wife might be dying, his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) baby might be starving, his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) whole family might be perishing in the cold--and all the while they were ringing their Christmas chimes!
<p/>They put him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) in a place where the snow could not beat in, where the cold could not eat through his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) bones; they brought him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) food and drink--why, in the name of heaven, if they must punish him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>), did they not put his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) family in jail and leave him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) outside--why could they find no better way to punish him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) than to leave three weak women and six helpless children to starve and freeze?
<p/>It was horrible, horrible! And the bitter mockery of it--all this was punishment for him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>)! That was their law, that was their justice!
<p/>Jurgis stood upright; trembling with passion, his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) hands clenched and his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) arms upraised, his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) whole soul ablaze with hatred and defiance.
<p/>, it was a lie, a hideous, brutal lie, a thing too black and hateful for any world but a world of nightmares.
<p/>Ten thousand curses upon them and their law! Their justice--it was a lie It was a sham and a loathsome mockery.
<p/>There was no justice, there was no right, anywhere in it--it was only force, it was tyranny, the will and the power, reckless and unrestrained!
<p/>They had ground him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) beneath their heel, they had devoured all his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) substance; they had murdered his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) old father, they had broken and wrecked his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) wife, they had crushed and cowed his (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) whole family; and now they were through with him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>), they had no further use for him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>)--and because he (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) had interfered with them, had gotten in their way
<p/>They had put him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) behind bars, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) had been a wild beast, a thing without sense or reason, without rights, without affections, without feelings.
<p/>, this was what they had done to him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>)! Nay, they would not even have treated a beast as they had treated him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>)!
<p/>Would any man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses have trapped a wild thing in its lair, and left its young behind to die?
<p/>These midnight hours were fateful ones to Jurgis; in them was the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rebellion, of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) outlawry and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unbelief.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no wit to trace back the social crime to its far sources--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not say that it was the thing men have called <div class="bookquote">``the system''  (<font color='red'><b>the thing men</b></font>)</div>that was crushing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the earth; that it was the packers, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) masters, who had bought up the law of the land, and had dealt out their brutal will to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the seat of justice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wronged, and that the world had wronged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); that the law, that society, with all its powers, had declared itself his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) foe.
<p/>And every hour his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul grew blacker, every hour he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dreamed new dreams of vengeance, of defiance, of raging, frenzied hate.
<p/>The vilest deeds, like poison weeds, Bloom well in prison air; It is only what is good in Man That wastes and withers there; Pale Anguish keeps the heavy gate, And the Warder is Despair.
<p/>So wrote a poet, to whom the world had dealt its justice-- I know not whether Laws be right, Or whether Laws be wrong
<p/>; All that we know who lie in gaol Is that the wall is strong. And they do well to hide their hell,
<p/>At seven o'clock the next morning Jurgis was let out to get water to wash his (<font color='blue'><b>Warder</b></font>) cell--a duty which he (<font color='blue'><b>Warder</b></font>) performed faithfully, but which most of the prisoners were accustomed to shirk, until their cells became so filthy that the guards interposed.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Warder</b></font>) had more <div class="bookquote">``duffers and dope,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and afterward was allowed three hours for exercise, in a long, cement-walked court roofed with glass.
<p/>For in it things are done That Son of God nor son of Man Ever should look upon! Chapter 17 Here were all the inmates of the jail crowded together.
<p/>At one side of the court was a place for visitors, cut off by two heavy wire screens, a foot apart, so that nothing could be passed in to the prisoners; here Jurgis watched anxiously, but there came no one to see him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cell, a keeper opened the door to let in another prisoner. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was a dapper young fellow, with a light brown mustache and blue eyes, and a graceful figure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nodded to Jurgis, and then, as the keeper closed the door upon him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), began gazing critically about him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>). '' Well, pal,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>) said, as his (<font color='blue'><b>pal</b></font>) glance encountered Jurgis again, <div class="bookquote">``good morning.
<p/>The newcomer went to the bunks and inspected the blankets; he (<font color='blue'><b>newcomer</b></font>) lifted up the mattress, and then dropped it with an exclamation.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>said Jurgis. '' A rum go for Christmas, eh? '' added the other. Jurgis nodded. '' My God!''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that's the worst yet. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) glanced at Jurgis again. '' Looks as if it hadn't been slept in last night.
<p/>Couldn't stand it, eh?'' <div class="bookquote">``I didn't want to sleep last night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>said Jurgis. '' When did you come in?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yesterday. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The other had another look around, and then wrinkled up his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nose. '' There's the devil of a stink in here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) said, suddenly.
<p/>'' What is it?'' '' It's me,'' said Jurgis. <div class="bookquote">``You?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Didn't they make you wash?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, but this don't wash.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I work in the stockyards--at least I did until the other day.
<p/>It's in my clothes.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' That's a new one on me,'' said the newcomer. '' I thought I'd been up against 'em all.
<p/>What are you in for?'' <div class="bookquote">``I hit my boss. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh--that's it. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) do?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) treated me mean.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I see. You're what's called an honest workingman!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What are you?'' Jurgis asked. <div class="bookquote">``I?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The other laughed. '' They say I'm a cracksman,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' What's that?'' asked Jurgis. '' Safes, and such things,'' answered the other. '' Oh,'' said Jurgis, wonderingly, and stared at the speaker in awe.
<p/>'' You mean you break into them--you-- you--'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>laughed the other, <div class="bookquote">``that's what they say. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) did not look to be over twenty-two or three, though, as Jurgis found afterward, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was thirty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) spoke like a man of education, like what the world calls a <div class="bookquote">``gentleman.''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that what you're here for?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis inquired.
<p/>'' No,'' was the answer. '' I'm here for disorderly conduct. They were mad because they couldn't get any evidence. ''
<p/>What's your name?'' the young fellow continued after a pause. '' My name's Duane--Jack Duane. I've more than a dozen, but that's my company one.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) seated himself on the floor with his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) back to the wall and his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) legs crossed, and went on talking easily; he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) soon put Jurgis on a friendly footing--he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was evidently a man of the world, used to getting on, and not too proud to hold conversation with a mere laboring man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew Jurgis out, and heard all about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life all but the one unmentionable thing; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told stories about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own life.
<p/>Being sent to jail had apparently not disturbed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cheerfulness; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">``done time''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>twice before, it seemed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took it all with a frolic welcome.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a great one for stories, not always of the choicest. What with women and wine and the excitement of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vocation, a man could afford to rest now and then.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not turn his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face to the wall and sulk, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to speak when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was spoken to; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) help being interested in the conversation of Duane--the first educated man with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had ever talked.
<p/>How could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) help listening with wonder while the other told of midnight ventures and perilous escapes, of feastings and orgies, of fortunes squandered in a night?
<p/>The young fellow had an amused contempt for Jurgis, as a sort of working mule; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), too, had felt the world's injustice, but instead of bearing it patiently, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had struck back, and struck hard.
<p/>Naturally, the aspect of prison life was changed for Jurgis by the arrival of a cell mate. He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) was striking all the time--there was war between him (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) and society.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) was a genial freebooter, living off the enemy, without fear or shame. He (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) was not always victorious, but then defeat did not mean annihilation, and need not break his (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) spirit.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) story came out, not in the first day, nor the second, but in the long hours that dragged by, in which they had nothing to do but talk and nothing to talk of
<p/>Withal he (<font color='blue'><b>mate</b></font>) was a goodhearted fellow--too much so, it appeared. but themselves. Jack Duane was from the East; he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was a college-bred man--had been studying electrical engineering.
<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) father had met with misfortune in business and killed himself; and there had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) mother and a younger brother and sister.
<p/>Also, there was an invention of Duane's; Jurgis could not understand it clearly, but it had to do with telegraphing, and it was a very important thing--there were fortunes in it, millions upon millions of dollars.
<p/>And Duane had been robbed of it by a great company, and got tangled up in lawsuits and lost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) money.
<p/>Then somebody had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) a tip on a horse race, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had tried to retrieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) fortune with another person's money, and had to run away, and all the rest had come from that.
<p/>The other asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) what had led him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) to safe-breaking--to Jurgis a wild and appalling occupation to think about. A man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had met, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cell mate had replied--one thing leads to another.
<p/>Didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever wonder about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family, Jurgis asked. Sometimes, the other answered, but not often--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) didn't allow it. Thinking about it would make it no better.
<p/>This wasn't a world in which a man had any business with a family; sooner or later Jurgis would find that out also, and give up the fight and shift for himself.
<p/>Jurgis was so transparently what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pretended to be that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cell mate was as open with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a child; it was pleasant to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adventures, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so full of wonder and admiration, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so new to the ways of the country.
<p/>Duane did not even bother to keep back names and places--he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) told all his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) triumphs and his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) failures, his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) loves and his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) griefs.
<p/>Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) introduced Jurgis to many of the other prisoners, nearly half of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) knew by name. The crowd had already given Jurgis a name--they called him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) ``the stinker.
<p/>Our friend had caught now and then a whiff from the sewers over which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lived, but this was the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had ever been splashed by their filth.
<p/>This jail was a Noah's ark of the city's crime--there were murderers, <div class="bookquote">``hold-up men''  (<font color='red'><b>murderers</b></font>)</div>and burglars, embezzlers, counterfeiters and forgers, bigamists, <div class="bookquote">``shoplifters,''  (<font color='red'><b>forgers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``confidence men,''  (<font color='red'><b>forgers</b></font>)</div>petty thieves and pickpockets, gamblers and procurers, brawlers, beggars, tramps and drunkards; they were black and white, old and young, Americans and natives of every nation under the sun.
<p/>There were hardened criminals and innocent men too poor to give bail; old men, and boys literally not yet in their teens.
<p/>They were the drainage of the great festering ulcer of society; they were hideous to look upon, sickening to talk to.
<p/>All life had turned to rottenness and stench in them--love was a beastliness, joy was a snare, and God was an imprecation.
<p/>'' This was cruel, but they meant no harm by it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took it with a good-natured grin. They strolled here and there about the courtyard, and Jurgis listened to them.
<p/>They could tell the whole hateful story of it, set forth the inner soul of a city in which justice and honor, women's bodies and men's souls, were for sale in the marketplace, and human beings writhed and fought and fell upon each other like wolves in a pit; in which lusts were raging fires, and men were fuel, and humanity was festering and stewing and wallowing in its own corruption.
<p/>Into this wild-beast tangle these men had been born without their consent, they had taken part in it because they could not help it; that they were in jail was no disgrace to them, for the game had never been fair, the dice were loaded.
<p/>They were swindlers and thieves of pennies and dimes, and they had been trapped and put out of the way by the swindlers and thieves of millions of dollars.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was ignorant and they were wise ; they had been everywhere and tried everything. To most of this Jurgis tried not to listen.
<p/>They frightened him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) with their savage mockery; and all the while his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) heart was far away, where his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) loved ones were calling.
<p/>Now and then in the midst of it his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) thoughts would take flight; and then the tears would come into his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) eyes--and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would be called back by the jeering laughter of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) companions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) paid one of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) fifteen cents for a postal card, and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) companion wrote a note to the family, telling them where he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was and when he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would be tried.
<p/>There came no answer to it, however, and at last, the day before New Year's, Jurgis bade good-by to Jack Duane.
<p/>The latter gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) address, or rather the address of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) mistress, and made Jurgis promise to look him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) up.
<p/>Maybe I could help you out of a hole some day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) said, and added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was sorry to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) spent a week in this company, and during all that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had no word from his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) home. '' Jurgis rode in the patrol wagon back to Justice Callahan's court for trial.
<p/>One of the first things he (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) made out as he (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) entered the room was Teta Elzbieta and little Kotrina, looking pale and frightened, seated far in the rear.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) heart began to pound, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) did not dare to try to signal to them, and neither did Elzbieta. He (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) seat in the prisoners' pen and sat gazing at them in helpless agony.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) saw that Ona was not with them, and was full of foreboding as to what that might mean. He (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) spent half an hour brooding over this--and then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) straightened up and the blood rushed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) face.
<p/>A man had come in--Jurgis could not see his (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) features for the bandages that swathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) knew the burly figure.
<p/>Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) felt a hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) collar, and heard a voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Sit down, you son of a--!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>It was Connor! A trembling seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) limbs bent as if for a spring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) subsided, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) never took his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) eyes off his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) enemy.
<p/>The fellow was still alive, which was a disappointment, in one way; and yet it was pleasant to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>), all in penitential plasters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) and the company lawyer, who was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>), came and took seats within the judge's railing; and a minute later the clerk called Jurgis' name, and the policeman jerked him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) feet and led him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) before the bar, gripping him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) tightly by the arm, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) should spring upon the boss.
<p/>The wife of the prisoner had been employed in a department near him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>), and had been discharged for impudence to him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>).
<p/>Jurgis listened while the man entered the witness chair, took the oath, and told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story. Half an hour later he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been violently attacked, knocked down, and almost choked to death.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had brought witnesses-- '' They will probably not be necessary,'' observed the judge and he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) turned to Jurgis. '' You admit attacking the plaintiff?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) asked.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>inquired Jurgis, pointing at the boss. '' Yes,'' said the judge. '' I hit him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), sir,'' said Jurgis. <div class="bookquote">``Say `your Honor,'''  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>said the officer, pinching his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) arm hard.
<p/>'' Your Honor,'' said Jurgis, obediently. '' You tried to choke him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)?'' '' Yes, sir, your Honor. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ever been arrested before?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, sir, your Honor. '' '' What have you to say for yourself?'' Jurgis hesitated. What had he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) to say?
<p/>In two years and a half he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had learned to speak English for practical purposes, but these had never included the statement that some one had intimidated and seduced his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) wife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) tried once or twice, stammering and balking, to the annoyance of the judge, who was gasping from the odor of fertilizer.
<p/>Finally, the prisoner made it understood that his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) vocabulary was inadequate, and there stepped up a dapper young man with waxed mustaches, bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) speak in any language he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) knew.
<p/>Jurgis began; supposing that he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) would be given time, he (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) explained how the boss had taken advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) wife's position to make advances to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and had threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) place.
<p/>When the interpreter had translated this, the judge, whose calendar was crowded, and whose automobile was ordered for a certain hour, interrupted with the remark:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Oh, I see. Well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) made love to your wife, why didn't she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) complain to the superintendent or leave the place?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the judge</b></font>)</div><p/>Jurgis hesitated, somewhat taken aback; he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) began to explain that they were very poor--that work was hard to get-- <div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Justice Callahan;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``so instead you thought you would knock him (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Callahan</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Callahan</b></font>) turned to the plaintiff, inquiring, <div class="bookquote">``Is there any truth in this story, Mr. Connor?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the plaintiff</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a particle, your Honor,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boss</b></font>)</div>said the boss. '' It is very unpleasant--they tell some such tale every time you have to discharge a woman--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said the judge. '' I hear it often enough. The fellow seems to have handled you pretty roughly.
<p/>It was only when the policeman who had him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) by the arm turned and started to lead him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) away that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) realized that sentence had been passed.
<p/>Thirty days and costs. Next case. '' Jurgis had been listening in perplexity. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) gazed round him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) wildly. '' Thirty days!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) panted and then he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) whirled upon the judge. '' What will my family do? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) cried frantically. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would have done well to think about them before you committed the assault,''  (<font color='red'><b>the judge</b></font>)</div>said the judge dryly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) turned to look at the next prisoner.
<p/>Jurgis would have spoken again, but the policeman had seized him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) by the collar and was twisting it, and a second policeman was making for him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) with evidently hostile intentions.
<p/>I have a wife and baby, sir, and they have no money--my God, they will starve to death!'' So he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) let them lead him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) away.
<p/>Far down the room he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw Elzbieta and Kotrina, risen from their seats, staring in fright; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) made one effort to go to them, and then, brought back by another twist at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) throat, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) head and gave up the struggle.
<p/>They thrust him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) into a cell room, where other prisoners were waiting; and as soon as court had adjourned they led him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) down with them into the <div class="bookquote">``Black Maria,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and drove him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) away.
<p/>It was even filthier and more crowded than the county jail; all the smaller fry out of the latter had been sifted into it--the petty thieves and swindlers, the brawlers and vagrants.
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cell mate Jurgis had an Italian fruit seller who had refused to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) graft to the policeman, and been arrested for carrying a large pocketknife; as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not understand a word of English our friend was glad when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) left.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gave place to a Norwegian sailor, who had lost half an ear in a drunken brawl, and who proved to be quarrelsome, cursing Jurgis because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) moved in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) bunk and caused the roaches to drop upon the lower one.
<p/>It would have been quite intolerable, staying in a cell with this wild beast, but for the fact that all day long the prisoners were put at work breaking stone.
<p/>Ten days of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) thirty Jurgis spent thus, without hearing a word from his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) family; then one day a keeper came and informed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) that there was a visitor to see him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>).
<p/>This time Jurgis was bound for the <div class="bookquote">``Bridewell,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>a petty jail where Cook County prisoners serve their time. Jurgis turned white, and so weak at the knees that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) could hardly leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) cell.
<p/>The man led him (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) down the corridor and a flight of steps to the visitors' room, which was barred like a cell.
<p/>Through the grating Jurgis could see some one sitting in a chair; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) came into the room the person started up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cook</b></font>) saw that it was little Stanislovas.
<p/>At the sight of some one from home the big fellow nearly went to pieces--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had to steady himself by a chair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) other hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) forehead, as if to clear away a mist.
<p/>'' Well?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, weakly. Little Stanislovas was also trembling, and all but too frightened to speak. '' They--they sent me to tell you--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, with a gulp.
<p/>'' Well?'' Jurgis repeated. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) followed the boy's glance to where the keeper was standing watching them. '' Never mind that,'' Jurgis cried, wildly.
<p/>'' How are they?'' '' Ona is very sick,'' Stanislovas said; <div class="bookquote">``and we are almost starving. We can't get along; we thought you might be able to help us.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Stanislovas</b></font>)</div>Jurgis gripped the chair tighter; there were beads of perspiration on his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) forehead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) hand shook. '' I--can't help you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Ona lies in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) room all day,'' the boy went on, breathlessly. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) won't eat anything, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) cries all the time.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) won't tell what is the matter and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) won't go to work at all. Then a long time ago the man came for the rent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very cross. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came again last week. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would turn us out of the house. And then Marija--'' A sob choked Stanislovas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopped.
<p/>'' What's the matter with Marija?'' cried Jurgis. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)'s cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hand!'' said the boy. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)'s cut it bad, this time, worse than before.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) can't work and it's all turning green, and the company doctor says she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) may--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) may have to have it cut off.
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) money is nearly all gone, too, and we can't pay the rent and the interest on the house; and we have no coal and nothing more to eat, and the man at the store, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) says--''
<p/>And Marija cries all the time-- The little fellow stopped again, beginning to whimper. <div class="bookquote">``Go on! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>the other panted in frenzy--<div class="bookquote">``Go on!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I will,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>sobbed Stanislovas. '' It's so--so cold all the time. And last Sunday it snowed again--a deep, deep snow--and I couldn't--
<p/>There was an old hatred between them because of the snow--ever since that dreadful morning when the boy had had his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) fingers frozen and Jurgis had had to beat him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to send him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) to work.
<p/>couldn't get to work. '' <div class="bookquote">``God!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis half shouted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) took a step toward the child. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands, looking as if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would try to break through the grating.
<p/>'' You little villain,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you didn't try!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I did--I did! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>wailed Stanislovas, shrinking from him (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) in terror. ''
<p/>I tried all day--two days. Elzbieta was with me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) couldn't either. We couldn't walk at all, it was so deep.
<p/>And we had nothing to eat, and oh, it was so cold! I tried, and then the third day Ona went with me--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Ona!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) tried to get to work, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had to. We were all starving. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) place--'' Jurgis reeled, and gave a gasp.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) went back to that place? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) screamed. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) tried to,'' said Stanislovas, gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) in perplexity.
<p/>'' Why not, Jurgis? '' The man breathed hard, three or four times. '' Go--on,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) panted, finally. '' I went with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>),'' said Stanislovas, <div class="bookquote">``but Miss Henderson wouldn't take her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) back.
<p/>And Connor saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) and cursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) was still bandaged up--why did you hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>), Jurgis? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Stanislovas</b></font>)</div>-LRB-There was some fascinating mystery about this, the little fellow knew; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) could get no satisfaction.-RRB-
<p/>Jurgis could not speak; he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) could only stare, his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) eyes starting out. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) has been trying to get other work,'' the boy went on; <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>)'s so weak she (<font color='blue'><b>Henderson</b></font>) can't keep up.
<p/>And my boss would not take me back, either-- Ona says he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) knows Connor, and that's the reason; they've all got a grudge against us now.
<p/>So I've got to go downtown and sell papers with the rest of the boys and Kotrina-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kotrina!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)'s been selling papers, too.
<p/>Sometimes they can't come home at all--I'm going to try to find them tonight and sleep where they do, it's so late
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) does best, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)'s a girl. Only the cold is so bad--it's terrible coming home at night, Jurgis. and it's such a long ways home.
<p/>Only mother said I must come, because you would want to know, and maybe somebody would help your family when they had put you in jail so you couldn't work.
<p/>I've had to walk, and I didn't know where it was--I don't know how to get back, either. And I walked all day to get here--and I only had a piece of bread for breakfast, Jurgis.
<p/>Mother hasn't any work either, because the sausage department is shut down; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) goes and begs at houses with a basket, and people give her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) food.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So little Stanislovas went on, sobbing as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) talked; and Jurgis stood, gripping the table tightly, saying not a word, but feeling that his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head would burst; it was like having weights piled upon him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), one after another, crushing the life out of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) struggled and fought within himself--as if in some terrible nightmare, in which a man suffers an agony, and cannot lift his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand, nor cry out, but feels that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is going mad, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain is on fire-- Just when it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that another turn of the screw would kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), little Stanislovas stopped.
<p/>Only she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) didn't get much yesterday; it was too cold for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fingers, and today she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was crying-- '' You cannot help us?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said weakly. Jurgis shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. '' They won't give you anything here? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook it again. ''
<p/>When are you coming out?'' '' Three weeks yet,'' Jurgis answered. And the boy gazed around him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) uncertainly. '' Then I might as well go,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/>Jurgis nodded. Then, suddenly recollecting, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pocket and drew it out, shaking. '' Here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, holding out the fourteen cents.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take this to them. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Stanislovas</b></font>)</div>And Stanislovas took it, and after a little more hesitation, started for the door. '' Good-by, Jurgis,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, and the other noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walked unsteadily as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) passed out of sight.
<p/>For a minute or so Jurgis stood clinging to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) chair, reeling and swaying; then the keeper touched him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) on the arm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) turned and went back to breaking stone.
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) sentence there were added <div class="bookquote">``court costs''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>of a dollar and a half--he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) was supposed to pay for the trouble of putting him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) in jail, and not having the money, was obliged to work it off by three days more of toil.
<p/>Nobody had taken the trouble to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) this--only after counting the days and looking forward to the end in an agony of impatience, when the hour came that he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) expected to be free he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) found himself still set at the stone heap, and laughed at when he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) ventured to protest.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) concluded he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) must have counted wrong; but as another day passed, he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) gave up all hope--and was sunk in the depths of despair, when one morning after breakfast a keeper came to him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) with the word that his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) time was up at last.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) doffed his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) prison garb, and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) old fertilizer clothing, and heard the door of the prison clang behind him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) stood upon the steps, bewildered; he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) could hardly believe that it was true,--that the sky was above him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) again and the open street before him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) was a free man.
<p/>Chapter 18 Jurgis did not get out of the Bridewell quite as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) had expected. But then the cold began to strike through his (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) clothes, and he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) started quickly away.
<p/>There had been a heavy snow, and now a thaw had set in; fine sleety rain was falling, driven by a wind that pierced Jurgis to the bone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) had not stopped for his-overcoat when he (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>) set out to <div class="bookquote">``do up''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Connor, and so his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) rides in the patrol wagons had been cruel experiences; his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) clothing was old and worn thin, and it never had been very warm.
<p/>Now as he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) trudged on the rain soon wet it through; there were six inches of watery slush on the sidewalks, so that his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) feet would soon have been soaked, even had there been no holes in his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) shoes.
<p/>Jurgis had had enough to eat in the jail, and the work had been the least trying of any that he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) had done since he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) came to Chicago; but even so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) had not grown strong--
<p/>the fear and grief that had preyed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) mind had worn him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) thin. Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) shivered and shrunk from the rain, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) pockets and hunching his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) shoulders together.
<p/>The Bridewell grounds were on the outskirts of the city and the country around them was unsettled and wild--on one side was the big drainage canal, and on the other a maze of railroad tracks, and so the wind had full sweep.
<p/>After walking a ways, Jurgis met a little ragamuffin whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) hailed: <div class="bookquote">``Hey, sonny! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The boy cocked one eye at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knew that Jurgis was a <div class="bookquote">``jailbird''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>by his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shaven head.
<p/>'' Wot yer want? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) queried. '' How do you go to the stockyards?'' Jurgis demanded. '' I don't go,'' replied the boy.
<p/>Jurgis hesitated a moment, nonplussed. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I mean which is the way?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why don't yer say so then? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>was the response, and the boy pointed to the northwest, across the tracks.
<p/>'' That way. '' <div class="bookquote">``How far is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis asked. '' I dunno,'' said the other. '' Mebbe twenty miles or so.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had to walk every foot of it, for they had turned him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out of jail without a penny in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pockets.
<p/>Yet, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) once got started, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) blood had warmed with walking, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forgot everything in the fever of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>'' Twenty miles!'' Jurgis echoed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) face fell. All the dreadful imaginations that had haunted him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cell now rushed into his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mind at once.
<p/>The agony was almost over--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was going to find out; and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pockets as he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) strode, following his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) flying desire, almost at a run.
<p/>Ona--the baby--the family--the house--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would know the truth about them all! And he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was coming to the rescue--he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was free again!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hands were his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could help them, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could do battle for them against the world. For an hour or so he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walked thus, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>The street was turning into a country road, leading out to the westward; there were snow-covered fields on either side of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) seemed to be leaving the city altogether. Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) met a farmer driving a two-horse wagon loaded with straw, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' Is this the way to the stockyards?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) asked. The farmer scratched his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head. '' I dunno jest where they be,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' But they're in the city somewhere, and you're going dead away from it now. '' Jurgis looked dazed. '' I was told this was the way,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Who told you?'' <div class="bookquote">``A boy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Well, mebbe he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was playing a joke on ye. The best thing ye kin do is to go back, and when ye git into town ask a policeman.
<p/>I'd take ye in, only I've come a long ways an' I'm loaded heavy. Git up!'' So Jurgis turned and followed, and toward the end of the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) began to see Chicago again.
<p/>Every few blocks there would be a railroad crossing on the level with the sidewalk, a deathtrap for the unwary; long freight trains would be passing, the cars clanking and crashing together, and Jurgis would pace about waiting, burning up with a fever of impatience.
<p/>Occasionally the cars would stop for some minutes, and wagons and streetcars would crowd together waiting, the drivers swearing at each other, or hiding beneath umbrellas out of the rain; at such times Jurgis would dodge under the gates and run across the tracks and between the cars, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>drivers</b></font>) life into his (<font color='blue'><b>drivers</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Past endless blocks of two-story shanties he (<font color='blue'><b>drivers</b></font>) walked, along wooden sidewalks and unpaved pathways treacherous with deep slush holes. He (<font color='blue'><b>drivers</b></font>) crossed a long bridge over a river frozen solid and covered with slush.
<p/>Not even on the river bank was the snow white-- the rain which fell was a diluted solution of smoke, and Jurgis' hands and face were streaked with black.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>drivers</b></font>) came into the business part of the city, where the streets were sewers of inky blackness, with horses sleeping and plunging, and women and children flying across in panic-stricken droves.
<p/>These streets were huge canyons formed by towering black buildings, echoing with the clang of car gongs and the shouts of drivers; the people who swarmed in them were as busy as ants--all hurrying breathlessly, never stopping to look at anything nor at each other.
<p/>The solitary trampish-looking foreigner, with water-soaked clothing and haggard face and anxious eyes, was as much alone as he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) hurried past them, as much unheeded and as lost, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) had been a thousand miles deep in a wilderness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) came again to the slum districts, to avenues of saloons and cheap stores, with long dingy red factory buildings, and coal-yards and railroad tracks; and then Jurgis lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) head and began to sniff the air like a startled animal--scenting the far-off odor of home.
<p/>It was late afternoon then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) was hungry, but the dinner invitations hung out of the saloons were not for him (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>).
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) came at last to the stockyards, to the black volcanoes of smoke and the lowing cattle and the stench.
<p/>Then, seeing a crowded car, his (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) impatience got the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>foreigner</b></font>) jumped aboard, hiding behind another man, unnoticed by the conductor.
<p/>A policeman gave him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) direction and told him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had five miles to go. In ten minutes more he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) street, and home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was half running as he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) came round the corner. There was the house, at any rate--and then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) stopped and stared.
<p/>Jurgis looked twice, bewildered; then he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) glanced at the house next door and at the one beyond--then at the saloon on the corner.
<p/>What was the matter with the house? Yes, it was the right place, quite certainly--he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had not made any mistake. But the house--the house was a different color!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) came a couple of steps nearer. Yes; it had been gray and now it was yellow! The trimmings around the windows had been red, and now they were green!
<p/>It was all newly painted! How strange it made it seem! Jurgis went closer yet, but keeping on the other side of the street.
<p/>A sudden and horrible spasm of fear had come over him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) knees were shaking beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) mind was in a whirl.
<p/>New paint on the house, and new weatherboards, where the old had begun to rot off, and the agent had got after them!
<p/>New shingles over the hole in the roof, too, the hole that had for six months been the bane of his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) soul--he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) having no money to have it fixed and no time to fix it himself, and the rain leaking in, and overflowing the pots and pans he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) put to catch it, and flooding the attic and loosening the plaster.
<p/>And now it was fixed! And the broken windowpane replaced! And curtains in the windows! New, white curtains, stiff and shiny!
<p/>A boy had come out, a stranger to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>); a big, fat, rosy-cheeked youngster, such as had never been seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) home before.
<p/>Then suddenly the front door opened. Jurgis stood, his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) chest heaving as he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) struggled to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) breath. Jurgis stared at the boy, fascinated.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) came down the steps whistling, kicking off the snow. He (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) stopped at the foot, and picked up some, and then leaned against the railing, making a snowball.
<p/>A moment later he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) looked around and saw Jurgis, and their eyes met; it was a hostile glance, the boy evidently thinking that the other had suspicions of the snowball.
<p/>When Jurgis started slowly across the street toward him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) gave a quick glance about, meditating retreat, but then he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) concluded to stand his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ground.
<p/>Jurgis took hold of the railing of the steps, for he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was a little unsteady. '' What--what are you doing here?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) managed to gasp. <div class="bookquote">``Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy. '' You--'' Jurgis tried again. '' What do you want here?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Me?''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>answered the boy, angrily. '' I live here.'' <div class="bookquote">``You live here!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis panted. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) turned white and clung more tightly to the railing.
<p/>'' You live here! Then where's my family? '' The boy looked surprised. '' Your family! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) echoed. And Jurgis started toward him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>'' I--this is my house! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Come off!''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>said the boy; then suddenly the door upstairs opened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) called: <div class="bookquote">``Hey, ma!
<p/>Here's a fellow says he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) owns this house. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A stout Irishwoman came to the top of the steps. '' What's that?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) demanded. Jurgis turned toward her (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>). '' Where is my family? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) cried, wildly. '' I left them here!
<p/>The woman stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in frightened wonder, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must have thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was dealing with a maniac--Jurgis looked like one.
<p/>This is my home! What are you doing in my home?'' '' Your home! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) echoed. '' My home! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>) half shrieked.
<p/>'' I lived here, I tell you.'' <div class="bookquote">``You must be mistaken,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>maniac</b></font>). '' No one ever lived here. This is a new house.
<p/>They told us so. They--'' '' What have they done with my family?'' shouted Jurgis, frantically. A light had begun to break upon the woman; perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had had doubts of what <div class="bookquote">``they''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>had told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>I bought the house only three days ago, and there was nobody here, and they told me it was all new.
<p/>'' I don't know where your family is,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. '' Do you really mean you had ever rented it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Rented it!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>panted Jurgis. '' I bought it! I paid for it! I own it! And they--my God, can't you tell me where my people went?
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) understand at last that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew nothing. Jurgis' brain was so confused that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not grasp the situation.
<p/>It was as if his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) family had been wiped out of existence; as if they were proving to be dream people, who never had existed at all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was quite lost--but then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought of Grandmother Majauszkiene, who lived in the next block. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) would know! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) turned and started at a run.
<p/>Grandmother Majauszkiene came to the door herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) cried out when she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) saw Jurgis, wild-eyed and shaking. Yes, yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>The family had moved; they had not been able to pay the rent and they had been turned out into the snow, and the house had been repainted and sold again the next week.
<p/>No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) had not heard how they were, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Grandmother</b></font>) could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that they had gone back to Aniele Jukniene, with whom they had stayed when they first came to the yards.
<p/>Wouldn't Jurgis come in and rest? It was certainly too bad--if only he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had not got into jail-- And so Jurgis turned and staggered away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) did not go very far round the corner he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) gave out completely, and sat down on the steps of a saloon, and hid his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands, and shook all over with dry, racking sobs.
<p/>Grief, despair, rage, overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)--what was any imagination of the thing to this heartbreaking, crushing reality of it--to the sight of strange people living in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) house, hanging their curtains to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) windows, staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with hostile eyes!
<p/>Their home! Their home! They had lost it! It was monstrous, it was unthinkable--they could not do it--it could not be true!
<p/>Only think what he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had suffered for that house--what miseries they had all suffered for it--the price they had paid for it!
<p/>Their sacrifices in the beginning, their three hundred dollars that they had scraped together, all they owned in the world, all that stood between them and starvation!
<p/>And then their toil, month by month, to get together the twelve dollars, and the interest as well, and now and then the taxes, and the other charges, and the repairs, and what not!
<p/>Why, they had put their very souls into their payments on that house, they had paid for it with their sweat and tears--yes, more, with their very lifeblood.
<p/>Dede Antanas had died of the struggle to earn that money--he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would have been alive and strong today if he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had not had to work in Durham's dark cellars to earn his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) share.
<p/>And Ona, too, had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) health and strength to pay for it--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was wrecked and ruined because of it; and so was he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), who had been a big, strong man three years ago, and now sat here shivering, broken, cowed, weeping like a hysterical child.
<p/>The whole long agony came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Ah! they had cast their all into the fight; and they had lost, they had lost!
<p/>And their house was gone--they were back where they had started from, flung out into the cold to starve and freeze!
<p/>Jurgis could see all the truth now--could see himself, through the whole long course of events, the victim of ravenous vultures that had torn into his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) vitals and devoured him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>); of fiends that had racked and tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>), mocking him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>), meantime, jeering in his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) face.
<p/>All that they had paid was gone--every cent of it. Ah, God, the horror of it, the monstrous, hideous, demoniacal wickedness of it!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) family, helpless women and children, struggling to live, ignorant and defenseless and forlorn as they were--and the enemies that had been lurking for them, crouching upon their trail and thirsting for their blood!
<p/>That trap of the extra payments, the interest, and all the other charges that they had not the means to pay, and would never have attempted to pay!
<p/>And then all the tricks of the packers, their masters, the tyrants who ruled them--the shutdowns and the scarcity of work, the irregular hours and the cruel speeding-up, the lowering of wages, the raising of prices!
<p/>The mercilessness of nature about them, of heat and cold, rain and snow; the mercilessness of the city, of the country in which they lived, of its laws and customs that they did not understand!
<p/>All of these things had worked together for the company that had marked them for its prey and was waiting for its chance.
<p/>And now, with this last hideous injustice, its time had come, and it had turned them out bag and baggage, and taken their house and sold it again!
<p/>And they could do nothing, they were tied hand and foot--the law was against them, the whole machinery of society was at their oppressors' command!
<p/>If Jurgis so much as raised a hand against them, back he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) would go into that wild-beast pen from which he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had just escaped!
<p/>To get up and go away was to give up, to acknowledge defeat, to leave the strange family in possession; and Jurgis might have sat shivering in the rain for hours before he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) could do that, had it not been for the thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) family.
<p/>It might be that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had worse things yet to learn--and so he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) feet and started away, walking on, wearily, half-dazed.
<p/>To Aniele's house, in back of the yards, was a good two miles; the distance had never seemed longer to Jurgis, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) saw the familiar dingy-gray shanty his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) heart was beating fast.
<p/>That first lying circular, that smooth-tongued slippery agent! He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) ran up the steps and began to hammer upon the door. The old woman herself came to open it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had shrunk all up with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) rheumatism since Jurgis had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yellow parchment face stared up at him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) from a little above the level of the doorknob.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gave a start when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>). '' Is Ona here? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) cried, breathlessly. '' Yes,'' was the answer, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s here.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis began, and then stopped short, clutching convulsively at the side of the door. From somewhere within the house had come a sudden cry, a wild, horrible scream of anguish.
<p/>And the voice was Ona's. For a moment Jurgis stood half-paralyzed with fright; then he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) bounded past the old woman and into the room.
<p/>One of them started to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet as Jurgis entered; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was haggard and frightfully thin, with one arm tied up in bandages--he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) hardly realized that it was Marija.
<p/>It was Aniele's kitchen, and huddled round the stove were half a dozen women, pale and frightened. He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) looked first for Ona; then, not seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) stared at the women, expecting them to speak.
<p/>But they sat dumb, gazing back at him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>), panic-stricken; and a second later came another piercing scream. It was from the rear of the house, and upstairs.
<p/>Jurgis bounded to a door of the room and flung it open; there was a ladder leading through a trap door to the garret, and he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) was at the foot of it when suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) heard a voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>), and saw Marija at his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) heels.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) seized him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) by the sleeve with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) good hand, panting wildly, <div class="bookquote">``No, no, Jurgis! Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' What do you mean?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) gasped. '' You mustn't go up,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) cried. Jurgis was half-crazed with bewilderment and fright. '' What's the matter?
<p/>Marija clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) tightly; he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) could hear Ona sobbing and moaning above, and he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) fought to get away and climb up, without waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) reply.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) shouted. '' What is it?'' '' No, no,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) rushed on. '' Jurgis! You mustn't go up! It's--it's the child!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The child? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) echoed in perplexity. <div class="bookquote">``Antanas? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>Marija answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), in a whisper: <div class="bookquote">``The new one! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And then Jurgis went limp, and caught himself on the ladder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) were a ghost. '' The new one! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) gasped. '' But it isn't time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) added, wildly.
<p/>Marija nodded. '' I know,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but it's come. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then again came Ona's scream, smiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) like a blow in the face, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) wince and turn white.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) voice died away into a wail--then he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) sobbing again, <div class="bookquote">``My God--let me die, let me die!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Marija hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) arms about him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), crying: <div class="bookquote">``Come out!
<p/>Come away!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) back into the kitchen, half carrying him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone all to pieces. It was as if the pillars of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul had fallen in--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was blasted with horror.
<p/>In the room he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sank into a chair, trembling like a leaf, Marija still holding him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), and the women staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in dumb, helpless fright.
<p/>And then again Ona cried out; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could hear it nearly as plainly here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) staggered to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feet. ''
<p/>Not very long,'' Marija answered, and then, at a signal from Aniele, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) rushed on: <div class="bookquote">``You go away, Jurgis you can't help--go away and come back later.
<p/>How long has this been going on? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) panted. '' It's all right--it's-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Who's with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis demanded; and then, seeing Marija hesitating, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried again, <div class="bookquote">``Who's with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)'s--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)'s all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) answered. '' Elzbieta's with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).'' '' But the doctor! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) panted. '' Some one who knows!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) seized Marija by the arm; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) trembled, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) voice sank beneath a whisper as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``We--we have no money.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Then, frightened at the look on his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) exclaimed: <div class="bookquote">``It's all right, Jurgis! You don't understand--go away--go away!
<p/>Ah, if you only had waited!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Above her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) protests Jurgis heard Ona again; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was almost out of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) mind. It was all new to him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), raw and horrible--it had fallen upon him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) like a lightning stroke.
<p/>When little Antanas was born he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had been at work, and had known nothing about it until it was over; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was not to be controlled.
<p/>The frightened women were at their wits' end; one after another they tried to reason with him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) understand that this was the lot of woman.
<p/>In the end they half drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) out into the rain, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) began to pace up and down, bareheaded and frantic.
<p/>Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) could hear Ona from the street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would first go away to escape the sounds, and then come back because he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) could not help it.
<p/>At the end of a quarter of an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) rushed up the steps again, and for fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would break in the door they had to open it and let him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) in.
<p/>There was no arguing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>). They could not tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) that all was going well-- how could they know , he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) cried--why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was dying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was being torn to pieces!
<p/>Listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>)--listen! Why, it was monstrous--it could not be allowed--there must be some help for it! Had they tried to get a doctor?
<p/>They might pay him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) afterward-- they could promise-- <div class="bookquote">``We couldn't promise, Jurgis,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>protested Marija. '' We had no money--we have scarcely been able to keep alive.''
<p/>'' But I can work,'' Jurgis exclaimed. '' I can earn money!'' '' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) answered--<div class="bookquote">``but we thought you were in jail.
<p/>Marija went on to tell how she (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had tried to find a midwife, and how they had demanded ten, fifteen, even twenty-five dollars, and that in cash.
<p/>How could we know when you would return? They will not work for nothing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' And I had only a quarter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) said.
<p/>I have spent every cent of my money--all that I had in the bank; and I owe the doctor who has been coming to see me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has stopped because he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) thinks I don't mean to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>'' And we owe Aniele for two weeks' rent, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) is nearly starving, and is afraid of being turned out.
<p/>We have been borrowing and begging to keep alive, and there is nothing more we can do-- '' <div class="bookquote">``And the children?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>cried Jurgis.
<p/>'' The children have not been home for three days, the weather has been so bad. They could not know what is happening--it came suddenly, two months before we expected it.''
<p/>Jurgis was standing by the table, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) caught himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hand; his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) head sank and his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) arms shook --it looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) were going to collapse.
<p/>Then suddenly Aniele got up and came hobbling toward him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), fumbling in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) skirt pocket. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) drew out a dirty rag, in one corner of which she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had something tied.
<p/>'' Here, Jurgis! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I have some money. Palauk! See! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) unwrapped it and counted it out--thirty-four cents.
<p/>And maybe the rest can help--give him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) some money, you; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) will pay you back some day, and it will do him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) good to have something to think about, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) doesn't succeed.
<p/>'' You go, now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and try and get somebody yourself. When he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) comes back, maybe it will be over.
<p/>And so the other women turned out the contents of their pocketbooks; most of them had only pennies and nickels, but they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) all.
<p/>Mrs. Olszewski, who lived next door, and had a husband who was a skilled cattle butcher, but a drinking man, gave nearly half a dollar, enough to raise the whole sum to a dollar and a quarter.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then Jurgis thrust it into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, still holding it tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fist, and started away at a run.
<p/>Chapter 19 <div class="bookquote">``Madame Haupt Hebamme'' (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>, ran a sign, swinging from a second-story window over a saloon on the avenue; at a side door was another sign, with a hand pointing up a dingy flight of stairs.
<p/>Jurgis went up them, three at a time. Madame Haupt was frying pork and onions, and had her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) door half open to let out the smoke.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) tried to knock upon it, it swung open the rest of the way, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) had a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), with a black bottle turned up to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) lips.
<p/>when she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) walked she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) rolled like a small boat on the ocean, and the dishes in the cupboard jostled each other.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) knocked louder, and she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) started and put it away. She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was a Dutchwoman, enormously fat-- She (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchwoman</b></font>) wore a filthy blue wrapper, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchwoman</b></font>) teeth were black.
<p/>'' Vot is it? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchwoman</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dutchwoman</b></font>) saw Jurgis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) had run like mad all the way and was so out of breath he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) could hardly speak.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) hair was flying and his (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) eyes wild--he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) looked like a man that had risen from the tomb. '' My wife!''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) panted. <div class="bookquote">``Come quickly!''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Haupt</b></font>)</div>Madame Haupt set the frying pan to one side and wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wrapper. ''
<p/>You vant me to come for a case? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inquired. '' Yes,'' gasped Jurgis. '' I haf yust come back from a case,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I haf had no time to eat my dinner. Still--if it is so bad--'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes--it is! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>). ''
<p/>Vell, den, perhaps--vot you pay?'' <div class="bookquote">``I--I--how much do you want?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis stammered. '' Tventy-five dollars. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) face fell. '' I can't pay that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) said.
<p/>The woman was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) narrowly. '' How much do you pay? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) demanded. '' Must I pay now--right away?''
<p/>'' Yes; all my customers do. '' '' I--I haven't much money,'' Jurgis began in an agony of dread. '' I've been in--in trouble--and my money is gone.
<p/>But I'll pay you--every cent--just as soon as I can; I can work-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Vot is your work?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have no place now.
<p/>I must get one. But I-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How much haf you got now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could hardly bring himself to reply.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``A dollar and a quarter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the woman laughed in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face. '' I vould not put on my hat for a dollar and a quarter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' It's all I've got,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pleaded, his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) voice breaking. '' I must get some one--my wife will die. I can't help it--
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) and answered, out of the steam and noise: <div class="bookquote">``Git me ten dollars cash, und so you can pay me the rest next mont'.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>I-- '' Madame Haupt had put back her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pork and onions on the stove. <div class="bookquote">``I can't do it--I haven't got it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/>Jurgis protested. '' I tell you I have only a dollar and a quarter. '' The woman turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work.
<p/>'' I don't believe you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. '' Dot is all to try to sheat me. Vot is de reason a big man like you has got only a dollar und a quarter?''
<p/>'' I've just been in jail,'' Jurgis cried-- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ready to get down upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees to the woman--<div class="bookquote">``and I had no money before, and my family has almost starved.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Vere is your friends, dot ought to help you?'' '' They are all poor,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered. '' They gave me this.
<p/>I have done everything I can--'' <div class="bookquote">``Haven't you got notting you can sell?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I have nothing, I tell you--I have nothing,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, frantically.
<p/>'' Can't you borrow it, den? Don't your store people trust you?'' Then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went on:
<p/>I vill save your wife und baby for you, and it vill not seem like mooch to you in de end.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Listen to me--if you git me you vill be glad of it. If you loose dem now how you tink you feel den?
<p/>Und here is a lady dot knows her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) business--I could send you to people in dis block, und dey vould tell you--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Madame Haupt</b></font>)</div>Madame Haupt was pointing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cooking-fork at Jurgis persuasively; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) words were more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) could bear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) flung up his (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) hands with a gesture of despair and turned and started away.
<p/>'' It's no use,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) exclaimed--but suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) heard the woman's voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) again-- <div class="bookquote">``I vill make it five dollars for you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) followed behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>), arguing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>). '' You vill be foolish not to take such an offer,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' You von't find nobody go out on a rainy day like dis for less. Vy, I haf never took a case in my life so sheap as dot.
<p/>I couldn't pay mine room rent--'' Jurgis interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with an oath of rage. '' If I haven't got it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) shouted, <div class="bookquote">``how can I pay it?
<p/>Damn it, I would pay you if I could, but I tell you I haven't got it. I haven't got it!
<p/>Do you hear me I haven't got it!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) turned and started away again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) was halfway down the stairs before Madame Haupt could shout to him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>):
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Vait! I vill go mit you! Come back!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) went back into the room again. '' It is not goot to tink of anybody suffering,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, in a melancholy voice.
<p/>'' I might as vell go mit you for noffing as vot you offer me, but I vill try to help you.
<p/>How far is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Three or four blocks from here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tree or four! Und so I shall get soaked! Gott in Himmel, it ought to be vorth more!
<p/>Vun dollar und a quarter, und a day like dis!--But you understand now--you vill pay me de rest of twenty-five dollars soon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``As soon as I can.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Some time dis mont'? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, within a month,'' said poor Jurgis. '' Anything! Hurry up!''
<p/>'' Vere is de dollar und a quarter? '' persisted Madame Haupt, relentlessly. Jurgis put the money on the table and the woman counted it and stowed it away.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) greasy hands again and proceeded to get ready, complaining all the time; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was so fat that it was painful for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to move, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grunted and gasped at every step.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took off her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrapper without even taking the trouble to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back to Jurgis, and put on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) corsets and dress.
<p/>Then there was a black bonnet which had to be adjusted carefully, and an umbrella which was mislaid, and a bag full of necessaries which had to be collected from here and there--the man being nearly crazy with anxiety in the meantime.
<p/>When they were on the street he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept about four paces ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), turning now and then, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hurry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on by the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desire.
<p/>But Madame Haupt could only go so far at a step, and it took all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) attention to get the needed breath for that.
<p/>It was not over yet, Jurgis learned--he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) heard Ona crying still; and meantime Madame Haupt removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) bonnet and laid it on the mantelpiece, and got out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) bag, first an old dress and then a saucer of goose grease, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) proceeded to rub upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hands.
<p/>The more cases this goose grease is used in, the better luck it brings to the midwife, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) keeps it upon her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) kitchen mantelpiece or stowed away in a cupboard with her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) dirty clothes, for months, and sometimes even for years.
<p/>They came at last to the house, and to the group of frightened women in the kitchen. Then they escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) to the ladder, and Jurgis heard her (<font color='blue'><b>midwife</b></font>) give an exclamation of dismay.
<p/>'' Gott in Himmel, vot for haf you brought me to a place like dis? I could not climb up dot ladder.
<p/>Vot sort of a place is dot for a woman to bear a child in--up in a garret, mit only a ladder to it?
<p/>I could not git troo a trap door! I vill not try it--vy, I might kill myself already. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves!''
<p/>At last Aniele succeeded in pacifying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) essayed the ascent; then, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had to be stopped while the old woman cautioned her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) about the floor of the garret.
<p/>They had no real floor--they had laid old boards in one part to make a place for the family to live; it was all right and safe there, but the other part of the garret had only the joists of the floor, and the lath and plaster of the ceiling below, and if one stepped on this there would be a catastrophe.
<p/>Jurgis stood in the doorway and listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scolding, half drowning out the horrible moans and screams of Ona. As it was half dark up above, perhaps one of the others had best go up first with a candle.
<p/>Then there were more outcries and threatening, until at last Jurgis had a vision of a pair of elephantine legs disappearing through the trap door, and felt the house shake as Madame Haupt started to walk.
<p/>Then suddenly Aniele came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) and took him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) by the arm. '' Now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you go away. Do as I tell you--you have done all you can, and you are only in the way.
<p/>Go away and stay away.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' But where shall I go?'' Jurgis asked, helplessly. '' I don't know where,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' Go on the street, if there is no other place--only go! And stay all night!'' In the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and Marija pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) out of the door and shut it behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>).
<p/>It was just about sundown, and it was turning cold--the rain had changed to snow, and the slush was freezing. Jurgis shivered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) thin clothing, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) hands into his (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) pockets and started away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) had not eaten since morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) felt weak and ill; with a sudden throb of hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) recollected he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) was only a few blocks from the saloon where he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) had been wont to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) dinner.
<p/>They might have mercy on him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) there, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) might meet a friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) set out for the place as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) could walk.
<p/>'' Hello, Jack,'' said the saloon-keeper, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) entered--they call all foreigners and unskilled men <div class="bookquote">``Jack''  (<font color='red'><b>men Jack</b></font>)</div>in Packingtown. '' Where've you been?
<p/>'' Jurgis went straight to the bar. '' I've been in jail,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I've just got out. I walked home all the way, and I've not a cent, and had nothing to eat since this morning.
<p/>And I've lost my home, and my wife's ill, and I'm done up. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The saloon-keeper gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) haggard white face and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) blue trembling lips.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) pushed a big bottle toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Fill her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. Jurgis could hardly hold the bottle, his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) hands shook so.
<p/>So Jurgis drank a large glass of whisky, and then turned to the lunch counter, in obedience to the other's suggestion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) ate all he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) dared, stuffing it in as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could; and then, after trying to speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) gratitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) went and sat down by the big red stove in the middle of the room.
<p/>'' Don't be afraid,'' said the saloon-keeper, <div class="bookquote">``fill her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up!''  (<font color='red'><b>the saloon-keeper</b></font>)</div>It was too good to last, however--like all things in this hard world.
<p/>In an hour or so the packing houses would be closing and the men coming in from their work; and they would not come into a place that smelt of Jurgis.
<p/>Also it was Saturday night, and in a couple of hours would come a violin and a cornet, and in the rear part of the saloon the families of the neighborhood would dance and feast upon wienerwurst and lager, until two or three o'clock in the morning.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) soaked clothing began to steam, and the horrible stench of fertilizer to fill the room. The saloon-keeper coughed once or twice, and then remarked, ``Say, Jack, I'm afraid you'll have to quit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was used to the sight of human wrecks, this saloon-keeper; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``fired''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>dozens of them every night, just as haggard and cold and forlorn as this one.
<p/>But they were all men who had given up and been counted out, while Jurgis was still in the fight, and had reminders of decency about him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) got up meekly, the other reflected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) had always been a steady man, and might soon be a good customer again.
<p/>'' '' You've been up against it, I see,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">``Come this way. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In the rear of the saloon were the cellar stairs.
<p/>There was a door above and another below, both safely padlocked, making the stairs an admirable place to stow away a customer who might still chance to have money, or a political light whom it was not advisable to kick out of doors.
<p/>The whisky had only half warmed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could not sleep, exhausted as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) was; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would nod forward, and then start up, shivering with the cold, and begin to remember again.
<p/>Hour after hour passed, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) could only persuade himself that it was not morning by the sounds of music and laughter and singing that were to be heard from the room.
<p/>When at last these ceased, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) expected that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) would be turned out into the street; as this did not happen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jack</b></font>) fell to wondering whether the man had forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>In the end, when the silence and suspense were no longer to be borne, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got up and hammered on the door; and the proprietor came, yawning and rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>So Jurgis spent the night. He (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) was keeping open all night, and dozing between customers. '' I want to go home,'' Jurgis said.
<p/>'' I'm worried about my wife--I can't wait any longer.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why the hell didn't you say so before?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man.
<p/>'' I thought you didn't have any home to go to. '' Jurgis went outside. It was four o'clock in the morning, and as black as night.
<p/>There were three or four inches of fresh snow on the ground, and the flakes were falling thick and fast. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned toward Aniele's and started at a run.
<p/>There was a light burning in the kitchen window and the blinds were drawn. The door was unlocked and Jurgis rushed in.
<p/>Aniele, Marija, and the rest of the women were huddled about the stove, exactly as before; with them were several newcomers, Jurgis noticed--also he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) noticed that the house was silent.
<p/>'' Well?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. No one answered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), they sat staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with their pale faces. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried again: <div class="bookquote">``Well?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>And then, by the light of the smoky lamp, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw Marija who sat nearest him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head slowly.
<p/>'' Not yet,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. And Jurgis gave a cry of dismay. '' Not yet? '' Again Marija's head shook. The poor fellow stood dumfounded.
<p/>'' I don't hear her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) gasped. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s been quiet a long time,'' replied the other. There was another pause--broken suddenly by a voice from the attic:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hello, there!''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>Several of the women ran into the next room, while Marija sprang toward Jurgis. '' Wait here! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, and the two stood, pale and trembling, listening.
<p/>In a few moments it became clear that Madame Haupt was engaged in descending the ladder, scolding and exhorting again, while the ladder creaked in protest.
<p/>In a moment or two she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the ground, angry and breathless, and they heard her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming into the room. Jurgis gave one glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and then turned white and reeled.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) jacket off, like one of the workers on the killing beds. Her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands and arms were smeared with blood, and blood was splashed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clothing and her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood breathing hard, and gazing about her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); no one made a sound. '' I haf done my best,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began suddenly.
<p/>'' I can do noffing more--dere is no use to try. '' Again there was silence. '' It ain't my fault,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' You had ought to haf had a doctor, und not vaited so long--it vas too late already ven I come.
<p/>'' Once more there was deathlike stillness. Marija was clutching Jurgis with all the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) one well arm. Then suddenly Madame Haupt turned to Aniele.
<p/>'' You haf not got something to drink, hey? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) queried. '' Some brandy? '' Aniele shook her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. ''
<p/>Herr Gott! '' exclaimed Madame Haupt. '' Such people! Perhaps you vill give me someting to eat den-- I haf had noffing since yesterday morning,
<p/>If I could haf known it vas like dis, I vould never haf come for such money as you gif me.
<p/>und I haf vorked myself near to death here. '' At this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chanced to look round, and saw Jurgis: She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger at him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>).
<p/>'' You understand me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, ``you pays me dot money yust de same! It is not my fault dat you send for me
<p/>so late I can't help your vife. It is not my fault if der baby comes mit one arm first, so dot I can't save it.
<p/>it is not fit for dogs to be born, und mit notting to eat only vot I brings in mine own pockets.
<p/>Here Madame Haupt paused for a moment to get her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath; and Marija, seeing the beads of sweat on Jurgis's forehead, and feeling the quivering of his (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) frame, broke out in a low voice: <div class="bookquote">``How is Ona?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/>I haf tried all night, und in dot place vere '' <div class="bookquote">``How is she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>echoed Madame Haupt. '' How do you tink she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can be ven
<p/>you leave her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to kill herself so? I told dem dot ven they send for de priest. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is young, und she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might haf got over it,
<p/>und been vell und strong, if she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been treated right. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fight hard, dot girl--she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not yet quite dead.
<p/>'' And Jurgis gave a frantic scream. '' Dead!'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vill die, of course,'' said the other angrily. '' Der baby is dead now.
<p/>The garret was lighted by a candle stuck upon a board; it had almost burned itself out, and was sputtering and smoking as Jurgis rushed up the ladder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could make out dimly in one corner a pallet of rags and old blankets, spread upon the floor; at the foot of it was a crucifix, and near it a priest muttering a prayer.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was covered with a blanket, but he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders and one arm lying bare; she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so shrunken he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would scarcely have known her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was all but a skeleton, and as white as a piece of chalk.
<p/>'' In a far corner crouched Elzbieta, moaning and wailing. Upon the pallet lay Ona. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) eyelids were closed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) lay still as death.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) staggered toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and fell upon his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) knees with a cry of anguish: <div class="bookquote">``Ona! Ona!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) did not stir. He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), and began to clasp it frantically, calling: <div class="bookquote">``Look at me!
<p/>Answer me! It is Jurgis come back-- don't you hear me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>There was the faintest quivering of the eyelids, and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) called again in frenzy:
<p/>One instant she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)--there was a flash of recognition between them, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) afar off, as through a dim vista, standing forlorn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) arms to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) called her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) in wild despair; a fearful yearning surged up in him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), hunger for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) that was agony, desire that was a new being born within him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) heartstrings, torturing him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ona! Ona!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then suddenly her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) eyes opened one instant. But it was all in vain--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) faded from him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) slipped back and was gone.
<p/>And a wail of anguish burst from him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), great sobs shook all his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) frame, and hot tears ran down his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) cheeks and fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) clutched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) arms and pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) lay cold and still--
<p/>The word rang through him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) like the sound of a bell, echoing in the far depths of him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), making forgotten chords to vibrate, old shadowy fears to stir--fears of the dark, fears of the void, fears of annihilation.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was gone--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was gone! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was dead! She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was dead! He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) would never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) again, never hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) again!
<p/>An icy horror of loneliness seized him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) saw himself standing apart and watching all the world fade away from him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>)--a world of shadows, of fickle dreams.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was like a little child, in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) fright and grief; he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) called and called, and got no answer, and his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) cries of despair echoed through the house, making the women downstairs draw nearer to each other in fear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was inconsolable, beside himself--the priest came and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) shoulder and whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) heard not a sound.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was gone away himself, stumbling through the shadows, and groping after the soul that had fled. So he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) lay. The gray dawn came up and crept into the attic.
<p/>The priest left, the women left, and he (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) was alone with the still, white figure--quieter now, but moaning and shuddering, wrestling with the grisly fiend.
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) would raise himself and stare at the white mask before him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>), then hide his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) eyes because he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) could not bear it.
<p/>Dead! dead! And she (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) was only a girl, she (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) was barely eighteen! Her (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) life had hardly begun--and here she (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) lay murdered--mangled, tortured to death!
<p/>More of the neighbors had come in, and they stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) in silence as he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) sank down upon a chair by the table and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) arms.
<p/>A few minutes later the front door opened; a blast of cold and snow rushed in, and behind it little Kotrina, breathless from running, and blue with the cold.
<p/>It was morning when he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) rose up and came down into the kitchen--haggard and ashen gray, reeling and dazed. '' I'm home again!
<p/>Looking from one to another she (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) saw that something had happened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) asked, in a lower voice: <div class="bookquote">``What's the matter?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) exclaimed. '' I could hardly-- '' And then, seeing Jurgis, she (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) stopped with an exclamation. Before anyone could reply, Jurgis started up; he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) went toward her (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>), walking unsteadily.
<p/>'' Where have you been? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) demanded. '' Selling papers with the boys,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) said. '' The snow--'' <div class="bookquote">``Have you any money?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) demanded.
<p/>'' Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``How much?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nearly three dollars, Jurgis.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Give it to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Kotrina</b></font>)</div>Kotrina, frightened by his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) manner, glanced at the others.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give it to me!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) commanded again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) hand into her (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) pocket and pulled out a lump of coins tied in a bit of rag.
<p/>Jurgis took it without a word, and went out of the door and down the street. Three doors away was a saloon.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Whisky,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) entered, and as the man pushed him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) some, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) tore at the rag with his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) teeth and pulled out half a dollar.
<p/>'' How much is the bottle? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) said. '' I want to get drunk. '' Chapter 20 But a big man cannot stay drunk very long on three dollars.
<p/>That was Sunday morning, and Monday night Jurgis came home, sober and sick, realizing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spent every cent the family owned, and had not bought a single instant's forgetfulness with it.
<p/>Ona was not yet buried; but the police had been notified, and on the morrow they would put the body in a pine coffin and take it to the potter's field.
<p/>Elzbieta was out begging now, a few pennies from each of the neighbors, to get enough to pay for a mass for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>); and the children were upstairs starving to death, while he (<font color='blue'><b>potter</b></font>), good-for-nothing rascal, had been spending their money on drink.
<p/>So spoke Aniele, scornfully, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) started toward the fire she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) added the information that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) kitchen was no longer for him (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) to fill with his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) phosphate stinks.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had crowded all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) boarders into one room on Ona's account, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) could go up in the garret where he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) belonged--and not there much longer, either, if he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) did not pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) some rent.
<p/>Jurgis went without a word, and, stepping over half a dozen sleeping boarders in the next room, ascended the ladder. It was dark up above; they could not afford any light; also it was nearly as cold as outdoors.
<p/>In a corner, as far away from the corpse as possible, sat Marija, holding little Antanas in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) one good arm and trying to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) to sleep.
<p/>Marija said not a word to Jurgis; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) crept in like a whipped cur, and went and sat down by the body.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) ought to have meditated upon the hunger of the children, and upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) own baseness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) thought only of Ona, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) gave himself up again to the luxury of grief.
<p/>In another corner crouched poor little Juozapas, wailing because he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had had nothing to eat all day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) shed no tears, being ashamed to make a sound; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) sat motionless and shuddering with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) anguish.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had never dreamed how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) loved Ona, until now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was gone; until now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) sat here, knowing that on the morrow they would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) away, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would never lay eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) again--never all the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) life.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) old love, which had been starved to death, beaten to death, awoke in him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) again; the floodgates of memory were lifted--he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) saw all their life together, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) in Lithuania, the first day at the fair, beautiful as the flowers, singing like a bird.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had married her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) tenderness, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) heart of wonder; the very words she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had spoken seemed to ring now in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) ears, the tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had shed to be wet upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had been the same hungry soul to the end, stretching out her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), pleading with him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), begging him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) for love and tenderness.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had suffered--so cruelly she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had suffered, such agonies, such infamies--ah, God, the memory of them was not to be borne.
<p/>The long, cruel battle with misery and hunger had hardened and embittered him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but it had not changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) What a monster of wickedness, of heartlessness, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been!
<p/>Every angry word that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had ever spoken came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and cut him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) like a knife; every selfish act that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had done--with what torments he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) paid for them now!
<p/>And such devotion and awe as welled up in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul--now that it could never be spoken, now that it was too late, too late!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) bosom-was choking with it, bursting with it; he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) crouched here in the darkness beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arms to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was gone forever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was dead!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could have screamed aloud with the horror and despair of it; a sweat of agony beaded his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) forehead, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dared not make a sound--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) scarcely dared to breathe, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shame and loathing of himself.
<p/>Late at night came Elzbieta, having gotten the money for a mass, and paid for it in advance, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) should be tempted too sorely at home.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) brought also a bit of stale rye bread that some one had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), and with that they quieted the children and got them to sleep.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) said not a word of reproach--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) and Marija had chosen that course before; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) would only plead with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), here by the corpse of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) dead wife.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) came over to Jurgis and sat down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Already Elzbieta had choked down her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) tears, grief being crowded out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) soul by fear.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had to bury one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) children--but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had done it three times before, and each time risen up and gone back to take up the battle for the rest.
<p/>Elzbieta was one of the primitive creatures: like the angleworm, which goes on living though cut in half; like a hen, which, deprived of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) chickens one by one, will mother the last that is left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>).
<p/>--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) asked no questions about the justice of it, nor the worth-whileness of life in which destruction and death ran riot.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) did this because it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) nature And this old common-sense view she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) labored to impress upon Jurgis, pleading with him (<font color='blue'><b>creatures</b></font>) with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Ona was dead, but the others were left and they must be saved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) did not ask for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) own children.
<p/>Ona had given Antanas to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>)--the little fellow was the only remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) must treasure it and protect it, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) must show himself a man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knew what Ona would have had him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) do, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) would ask of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at this moment, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) could speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>It was a terrible thing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) should have died as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had; but the life had been too hard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had to go.
<p/>It was terrible that they were not able to bury her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could not even have a day to mourn her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>)--but so it was.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) and Marija could care for them somehow, but there was Antanas, his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) own son. Their fate was pressing; they had not a cent, and the children would perish--some money must be had.
<p/>In a little while they would be out of danger--now that they had given up the house they could live more cheaply, and with all the children working they could get along, if only he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would not go to pieces.
<p/>It was a struggle for life with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was not afraid that Jurgis would go on drinking, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had no money for that, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was wild with dread at the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) might desert them, might take to the road, as Jonas had done.
<p/>Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) not be a man for Ona's sake, and pull himself together? So Elzbieta went on, with feverish intensity. But with Ona's dead body beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) eyes, Jurgis could not well think of treason to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) would give the little fellow his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) chance--would get to work at once, yes, tomorrow, without even waiting for Ona to be buried.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonas</b></font>) would try, for the sake of Antanas. They might trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) word, come what might.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was out before daylight the next morning, headache, heartache, and all. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) went straight to Graham's fertilizer mill, to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) could get back his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) job.
<p/>But the boss shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) head when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>)--no, his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) place had been filled long ago, and there was no room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>).
<p/>'' Do you think there will be?'' Jurgis asked. '' I may have to wait.'' '' No,'' said the other, <div class="bookquote">``it will not be worth your while to wait--there will be nothing for you here.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis stood gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) in perplexity. '' What is the matter? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) asked. '' Didn't I do my work?
<p/>The other met his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) look with one of cold indifference, and answered, <div class="bookquote">``There will be nothing for you here, I said.
<p/>Jurgis had his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) suspicions as to the dreadful meaning of that incident, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) went away with a sinking at the heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) went and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) stand with the mob of hungry wretches who were standing about in the snow before the time station.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) stayed, breakfastless, for two hours, until the throng was driven away by the clubs of the police.
<p/>Jurgis had made a good many acquaintances in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) long services at the yards--there were saloon-keepers who would trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) for a drink and a sandwich, and members of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) old union who would lend him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) a dime at a pinch.
<p/>It was not a question of life and death for him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), therefore; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) might hunt all day, and come again on the morrow, and try hanging on thus for weeks, like hundreds and thousands of others.
<p/>Meantime, Teta Elzbieta would go and beg, over in the Hyde Park district, and the children would bring home enough to pacify Aniele, and keep them all alive.
<p/>It was at the end of a week of this sort of waiting, roaming about in the bitter winds or loafing in saloons, that Jurgis stumbled on a chance in one of the cellars of Jones's big packing plant.
<p/>There was no work for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) that day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) saw a foreman passing the open doorway, and hailed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) for a job.
<p/>'' Push a truck? '' inquired the man, and Jurgis answered, <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>before the words were well out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>'' What's your name?'' demanded the other. '' Jurgis Rudkus. '' <div class="bookquote">``Worked in the yards before?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Whereabouts?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Two places--Brown's killing beds and Durham's fertilizer mill.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why did you leave there?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' The first time I had an accident, and the last time I was sent up for a month.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I see. Well, I'll give you a trial. Come early tomorrow and ask for Mr. Thomas. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>So Jurgis rushed home with the wild tidings that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had a job--that the terrible siege was over.
<p/>The remnants of the family had quite a celebration that night; and in the morning Jurgis was at the place half an hour before the time of opening.
<p/>The foreman came in shortly afterward, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) saw Jurgis he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) frowned. '' Oh,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I promised you a job, didn't I?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, sir,'' said Jurgis. '' Well, I'm sorry, but I made a mistake. I can't use you.'' Jurgis stared, dumfounded.
<p/>'' What's the matter? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) gasped. '' Nothing,'' said the man, <div class="bookquote">``only I can't use you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>There was the same cold, hostile stare that he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) had had from the boss of the fertilizer mill.
<p/>Out in the saloons the men could tell him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) all about the meaning of it; they gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) with pitying eyes--poor devil, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) was blacklisted!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) knew that there was no use in saying a word, and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) turned and went away. What had he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) done?
<p/>they asked--knocked down his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) boss? Good heavens, then he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) might have known! Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) stood as much chance of getting a job in Packingtown as of being chosen mayor of Chicago.
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) time hunting? They had him (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) on a secret list in every office, big and little, in the place.
<p/>They had his (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) name by this time in St. Louis and New York, in Omaha and Boston, in Kansas City and St. Joseph.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was condemned and sentenced, without trial and without appeal; he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) could never work for the packers again--he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) could not even clean cattle pens or drive a truck in any place where they controlled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would never be told anything about it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would never get any more satisfaction than he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) had gotten just now; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) would always find when the time came that he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was not needed.
<p/>It would not do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) to give any other name, either--they had company <div class="bookquote">``spotters''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>for just that purpose, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) wouldn't keep a job in Packingtown three days.
<p/>It was worth a fortune to the packers to keep their blacklist effective, as a warning to the men and a means of keeping down union agitation and political discontent.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) might try it, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) chose, as hundreds had tried it, and found out for themselves. Jurgis went home, carrying these new tidings to the family council.
<p/>It was a most cruel thing; here in this district was his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) home, such as it was, the place he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) was used to and the friends he (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) knew--and now every possibility of employment in it was closed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>).
<p/>There was nothing in Packingtown but packing houses; and so it was the same thing as evicting him (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) home.
<p/>It would be convenient, downtown, to the children's place of work; but then Marija was on the road to recovery, and had hopes of getting a job in the yards; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) old-time lover once a month, because of the misery of their state, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) could not make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Joseph</b></font>) mind to go away and give him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) up forever.
<p/>Then, too, Elzbieta had heard something about a chance to scrub floors in Durham's offices and was waiting every day for word.
<p/>In the end it was decided that Jurgis should go downtown to strike out for himself, and they would decide after he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) got a job.
<p/>As there was no one from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could borrow there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) dared not beg for fear of being arrested, it was arranged that every day he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) should meet one of the children and be given fifteen cents of their earnings, upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) could keep going.
<p/>Then all day he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was to pace the streets with hundreds and thousands of other homeless wretches inquiring at stores, warehouses, and factories for a chance; and at night he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was to crawl into some doorway or underneath a truck, and hide there until midnight, when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) might get into one of the station houses, and spread a newspaper upon the floor, and lie down in the midst of a throng of <div class="bookquote">``bums''  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>and beggars, reeking with alcohol and tobacco, and filthy with vermin and disease.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) and the two women spent all day and half the night discussing it. So for two weeks more Jurgis fought with the demon of despair.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) got a chance to load a truck for half a day, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) carried an old woman's valise and was given a quarter.
<p/>This let him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) into a lodging-house on several nights when he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) might otherwise have frozen to death; and it also gave him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) a chance now and then to buy a newspaper in the morning and hunt up jobs while his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) rivals were watching and waiting for a paper to be thrown away.
<p/>This, however, was really not the advantage it seemed, for the newspaper advertisements were a cause of much loss of precious time and of many weary journeys.
<p/>A full half of these were <div class="bookquote">``fakes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>put in by the endless variety of establishments which preyed upon the helpless ignorance of the unemployed.
<p/>If Jurgis lost only his (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) time, it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) had nothing else to lose; whenever a smooth-tongued agent would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) of the wonderful positions he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had on hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) could only shake his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) head sorrowfully and say that he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had not the necessary dollar to deposit; when it was explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) what <div class="bookquote">``big money''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) family could make by coloring photographs, he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) could only promise to come in again when he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) had two dollars to invest in the outfit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) met this man on his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) way to work in the giant factories of the Harvester Trust; and his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) friend told him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) to come along and he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) would speak a good word for him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) boss, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) knew well.
<p/>So Jurgis trudged four or five miles, and passed through a waiting throng of unemployed at the gate under the escort of his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) friend.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) knees nearly gave way beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) when the foreman, after looking him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) over and questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>), told him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) could find an opening for him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>).
<p/>How much this accident meant to Jurgis he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) realized only by stages; for he (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) found that the harvester works were the sort of place to which philanthropists and reformers pointed with pride.
<p/>It had some thought for its employees; its workshops were big and roomy, it provided a restaurant where the workmen could buy good food at cost, it had even a reading room, and decent places where its girl-hands could rest; also the work was free from many of the elements of filth and repulsiveness that prevailed at the stockyards.
<p/>Day after day Jurgis discovered these things--things never expected nor dreamed of by him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>)--until this new place came to seem a kind of a heaven to him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>).
<p/>It was an enormous establishment, covering a hundred and sixty acres of ground, employing five thousand people, and turning out over three hundred thousand machines every year--a good part of all the harvesting and mowing machines used in the country.
<p/>Jurgis saw very little of it, of course--it was all specialized work, the same as at the stockyards; each one of the hundreds of parts of a mowing machine was made separately, and sometimes handled by hundreds of men.
<p/>Where Jurgis worked there was a machine which cut and stamped a certain piece of steel about two square inches in size; the pieces came tumbling out upon a tray, and all that human hands had to do was to pile them in regular rows, and change the trays at intervals.
<p/>This was done by a single boy, who stood with eyes and thought centered upon it, and fingers flying so fast that the sounds of the bits of steel striking upon each other was like the music of an express train as one hears it in a sleeping car at night.
<p/>This was <div class="bookquote">``piece-work,''  (<font color='red'><b>the boy</b></font>)</div>of course; and besides it was made certain that the boy did not idle, by setting the machine to match the highest possible speed of human hands.
<p/>Thirty thousand of these pieces he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) handled every day, nine or ten million every year--how many in a lifetime it rested with the gods to say.
<p/>Near by him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) men sat bending over whirling grindstones, putting the finishing touches to the steel knives of the reaper; picking them out of a basket with the right hand, pressing first one side and then the other against the stone and finally dropping them with the left hand into another basket.
<p/>In the end Jurgis got a chance through an accidental meeting with an old-time acquaintance of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) union days. One of these men told Jurgis that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had sharpened three thousand pieces of steel a day for thirteen years.
<p/>In the next room were wonderful machines that ate up long steel rods by slow stages, cutting them off, seizing the pieces, stamping heads upon them, grinding them and polishing them, threading them, and finally dropping them into a basket, all ready to bolt the harvesters together.
<p/>In other places all these various parts were dipped into troughs of paint and hung up to dry, and then slid along on trolleys to a room where men streaked them with red and yellow, so that they might look cheerful in the harvest fields.
<p/>From yet another machine came tens of thousands of steel burs to fit upon these bolts. Jurgis's friend worked upstairs in the casting rooms, and his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) task was to make the molds of a certain part.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) shoveled black sand into an iron receptacle and pounded it tight and set it aside to harden; then it would be taken out, and molten iron poured into it.
<p/>You might see him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), along with dozens of others, toiling like one possessed by a whole community of demons; his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) arms working like the driving rods of an engine, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) long, black hair flying wild, his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes starting out, the sweat rolling in rivers down his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) face.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had shoveled the mold full of sand, and reached for the pounder to pound it with, it was after the manner of a canoeist running rapids and seizing a pole at sight of a submerged rock.
<p/>All day long this man would toil thus, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole being centered upon the purpose of making twenty-three instead of twenty-two and a half cents an hour; and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) product would be reckoned up by the census taker, and jubilant captains of industry would boast of it in their banquet halls, telling how our workers are nearly twice as efficient as those of any other country.
<p/>If we are the greatest nation the sun ever shone upon, it would seem to be mainly because we have been able to goad our wage-earners to this pitch of frenzy; though there are a few other things that are great among us including our drink-bill, which is a billion and a quarter of dollars a year, and doubling itself every decade.
<p/>There was a machine which stamped out the iron plates, and then another which, with a mighty thud, mashed them to the shape of the sitting-down portion of the American farmer.
<p/>Then they were piled upon a truck, and it was Jurgis's task to wheel them to the room where the machines were <div class="bookquote">``assembled.
<p/>This man, too, was paid by the mold--or rather for perfect castings, nearly half his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work going for naught. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>This was child's play for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got a dollar and seventy-five cents a day for it
<p/>; on Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) paid Aniele the seventy-five cents a week he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owed her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) garret, and also redeemed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) overcoat, which Elzbieta had put in pawn when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in jail.
<p/>A man cannot go about in midwinter in Chicago with no overcoat and not pay for it, and Jurgis had to walk or ride five or six miles back and forth to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work.
<p/>It so happened that half of this was in one direction and half in another, necessitating a change of cars; the law required that transfers be given at all intersecting points, but the railway corporation had gotten round this by arranging a pretense at separate ownership.
<p/>So whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished to ride, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to pay ten cents each way, or over ten per cent of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) income to this power, which had gotten its franchises long ago by buying up the city council, in the face of popular clamor amounting almost to a rebellion.
<p/>Tired as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt at night, and dark and bitter cold as it was in the morning, Jurgis generally chose to walk; at the hours other workmen were traveling, the streetcar monopoly saw fit to put on so few cars that there would be men hanging to every foot of the backs of them and often crouching upon the snow-covered roof.
<p/>Of course the doors could never be closed, and so the cars were as cold as outdoors; Jurgis, like many others, found it better to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fare for a drink and a free lunch, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) strength to walk.
<p/>This last was a great blessing. These, however, were all slight matters to a man who had escaped from Durham's fertilizer mill.
<p/>but then the awful load of the rent and interest was off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders, and when Marija was well again they could start over and save.
<p/>In the shop where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) worked was a man, a Lithuanian like himself, whom the others spoke of in admiring whispers, because of the mighty feats he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was performing.
<p/>All day he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat at a machine turning bolts; and then in the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to the public school to study English and learn to read.
<p/>In addition, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a family of eight children to support and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) earnings were not enough, on Saturdays and Sundays he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) served as a watchman; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was required to press two buttons at opposite ends of a building every five minutes, and as the walk only took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) two minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had three minutes to study between each trip.
<p/>Jurgis felt jealous of this fellow; for that was the sort of thing he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) himself had dreamed of, two or three years ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might do it even yet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had a fair chance--he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) might attract attention and become a skilled man or a boss, as some had done in this place.
<p/>Suppose that Marija could get a job in the big mill where they made binder twine--then they would move into this neighborhood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would really have a chance.
<p/>With a hope like that, there was some use in living; to find a place where you were treated like a human being--by God!
<p/>Jurgis began to pick up heart again and to make plans. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) house he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would show them how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could appreciate it.
<p/>And then one afternoon, the ninth of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) work in the place, when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went to get his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) overcoat he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw a group of men crowded before a placard on the door, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) went over and asked what it was, they told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that beginning with the morrow his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) department of the harvester works would be closed until further notice!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) laughed to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would hang on to this job! Chapter 21 That was the way they did it!
<p/>There was not half an hour's warning--the works were closed! It had happened that way before, said the men, and it would happen that way forever.
<p/>They had made all the harvesting machines that the world needed, and now they had to wait till some wore out!
<p/>It was nobody's fault--that was the way of it; and thousands of men and women were turned out in the dead of winter, to live upon their savings if they had any, and otherwise to die.
<p/>So many tens of thousands already in the city, homeless and begging for work, and now several thousand more added to them!
<p/>Jurgis walked home-with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) pittance of pay in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) pocket, heartbroken, overwhelmed. One more bandage had been torn from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) eyes, one more pitfall was revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>)!
<p/>Of what help was kindness and decency on the part of employers--when they could not keep a job for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>), when there were more harvesting machines made than the world was able to buy!
<p/>What a hellish mockery it was, anyway, that a man should slave to make harvesting machines for the country, only to be turned out to starve for doing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty too well!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not drink anything, because Elzbieta got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money for safekeeping, and knew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too well to be in the least frightened by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) angry demands.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stayed up in the garret however, and sulked--what was the use of a man's hunting a job when it was taken from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had time to learn the work?
<p/>But then their money was going again, and little Antanas was hungry, and crying with the bitter cold of the garret.
<p/>It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) two days to get over this heart-sickening disappointment. Also Madame Haupt, the midwife, was after him (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) for some money.
<p/>For another ten days he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) roamed the streets and alleys of the huge city, sick and hungry, begging for any work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) tried in stores and offices, in restaurants and hotels, along the docks and in the railroad yards, in warehouses and mills and factories where they made products that went to every corner of the world.
<p/>There were often one or two chances--but there were always a hundred men for every chance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) turn would not come.
<p/>At night he (<font color='blue'><b>Haupt</b></font>) crept into sheds and cellars and doorways--until there came a spell of belated winter weather, with a raging gale, and the thermometer five degrees below zero at sundown and falling all night.
<p/>Then Jurgis fought like a wild beast to get into the big Harrison Street police station, and slept down in a corridor, crowded with two other men upon a single step.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) had to fight often in these days to fight for a place near the factory gates, and now and again with gangs on the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) found, for instance, that the business of carrying satchels for railroad passengers was a pre-empted one--whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) essayed it, eight or ten men and boys would fall upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) and force him (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) to run for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) life.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Harrison</b></font>) went out once more. They always had the policeman <div class="bookquote">``squared,''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>and so there was no use in expecting protection.
<p/>That Jurgis did not starve to death was due solely to the pittance the children brought him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>). And even this was never certain.
<p/>For one thing the cold was almost more than the children could bear; and then they, too, were in perpetual peril from rivals who plundered and beat them.
<p/>The law was against them, too--little Vilimas, who was really eleven, but did not look to be eight, was stopped on the streets by a severe old lady in spectacles, who told him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was too young to be working and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) did not stop selling papers she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would send a truant officer after him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>).
<p/>Also one night a strange man caught little Kotrina by the arm and tried to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) into a dark cellar-way, an experience which filled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with such terror that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was hardly to be kept at work.
<p/>At last, on a Sunday, as there was no use looking for work, Jurgis went home by stealing rides on the cars.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) found that they had been waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for three days--there was a chance of a job for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was quite a story.
<p/>Juozapas had only one leg, having been run over by a wagon when a little child, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had got himself a broomstick, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm for a crutch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fallen in with some other children and found the way to Mike Scully's dump, which lay three or four blocks away.
<p/>To this place there came every day many hundreds of wagon-loads of garbage and trash from the lake front, where the rich people lived; and in the heaps the children raked for food--there were hunks of bread and potato peelings and apple cores and meat bones, all of it half frozen and quite unspoiled.
<p/>Little Juozapas gorged himself, and came home with a newspaper full, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was feeding to Antanas when his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) mother came in.
<p/>Little Juozapas, who was near crazy with hunger these days, had gone out on the street to beg for himself. Elzbieta was horrified, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) did not believe that the food out of the dumps was fit to eat.
<p/>The next day, however, when no harm came of it and Juozapas began to cry with hunger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) gave in and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) might go again.
<p/>And that afternoon he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) came home with a story of how while he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had been digging away with a stick, a lady upon the street had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>).
<p/>A real fine lady, the little boy explained, a beautiful lady; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wanted to know all about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) got the garbage for chickens, and why he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) walked with a broomstick, and why Ona had died, and how Jurgis had come to go to jail, and what was the matter with Marija, and everything.
<p/>In the end she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had asked where he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lived, and said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and bring him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) a new crutch to walk with.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) really came, the very next morning, and climbed the ladder to the garret, and stood and stared about her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), turning pale at the sight of the blood stains on the floor where Ona had died.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) had on a hat with a bird upon it, Juozapas added, and a long fur snake around her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) neck. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``settlement worker,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) explained to Elzbieta--she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) lived around on Ashland Avenue.
<p/>Elzbieta knew the place, over a feed store; somebody had wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) to go there, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had not cared to, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) thought that it must have something to do with religion, and the priest did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) to have anything to do with strange religions.
<p/>They were rich people who came to live there to find out about the poor people; but what good they expected it would do them to know, one could not imagine.
<p/>So spoke Elzbieta, naively, and the young lady laughed and was rather at a loss for an answer--she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) stood and gazed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), and thought of a cynical remark that had been made to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was standing upon the brink of the pit of hell and throwing in snowballs to lower the temperature.
<p/>Elzbieta was glad to have somebody to listen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) told all their woes--what had happened to Ona, and the jail, and the loss of their home, and Marija's accident, and how Ona had died, and how Jurgis could get no work.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) listened the pretty young lady's eyes filled with tears, and in the midst of it she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) burst into weeping and hid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) face on Elzbieta's shoulder, quite regardless of the fact that the woman had on a dirty old wrapper and that the garret was full of fleas.
<p/>Poor Elzbieta was ashamed of herself for having told so woeful a tale, and the other had to beg and plead with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) to go on.
<p/>The end of it was that the young lady sent them a basket of things to eat, and left a letter that Jurgis was to take to a gentleman who was superintendent in one of the mills of the great steelworks in South Chicago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) will get Jurgis something to do,'' the young lady had said, and added, smiling through her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tears--<div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) doesn't, he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) will never marry me.
<p/>The steel-works were fifteen miles away, and as usual it was so contrived that one had to pay two fares to get there.
<p/>Far and wide the sky was flaring with the red glare that leaped from rows of towering chimneys--for it was pitch dark when Jurgis arrived.
<p/>The vast works, a city in themselves, were surrounded by a stockade; and already a full hundred men were waiting at the gate where new hands were taken on.
<p/>Soon after daybreak whistles began to blow, and then suddenly thousands of men appeared, streaming from saloons and boardinghouses across the way, leaping from trolley cars that passed--it seemed as if they rose out of the ground, in the dim gray light.
<p/>A river of them poured in through the gate--and then gradually ebbed away again, until there were only a few late ones running, and the watchman pacing up and down, and the hungry strangers stamping and shivering.
<p/>The gatekeeper was surly, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) through a catechism, but he (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) insisted that he (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) knew nothing, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) had taken the precaution to seal his (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) letter, there was nothing for the gatekeeper to do but send it to the person to whom it was addressed.
<p/>A messenger came back to say that Jurgis should wait, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) came inside of the gate, perhaps not sorry enough that there were others less fortunate watching him (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) with greedy eyes.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>'' Jurgis presented his (<font color='blue'><b>gatekeeper</b></font>) precious letter. The great mills were getting under way--one could hear a vast stirring, a rolling and rumbling and hammering.
<p/>Little by little the scene grew plain: towering, black buildings here and there, long rows of shops and sheds, little railways branching everywhere, bare gray cinders underfoot and oceans of billowing black smoke above.
<p/>On one side of the grounds ran a railroad with a dozen tracks, and on the other side lay the lake, where steamers came to load.
<p/>Jurgis had time enough to stare and speculate, for it was two hours before he (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) was summoned. He (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>) went into the office building, where a company timekeeper interviewed him (<font color='blue'><b>dozen</b></font>).
<p/>The superintendent was busy, he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) -LRB-the timekeeper-RRB- would try to find Jurgis a job. He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) had never worked in a steel mill before?
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) was ready for anything? Well, then, they would go and see. So they began a tour, among sights that made Jurgis stare amazed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) wondered if ever he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) could get used to working in a place like this, where the air shook with deafening thunder, and whistles shrieked warnings on all sides of him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) at once; where miniature steam engines came rushing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>), and sizzling, quivering, white-hot masses of metal sped past him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>), and explosions of fire and flaming sparks dazzled him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) and scorched his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) face.
<p/>The men in these mills were all black with soot, and hollow-eyed and gaunt; they worked with fierce intensity, rushing here and there, and never lifting their eyes from their tasks.
<p/>Jurgis clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) guide like a scared child to its nurse, and while the latter hailed one foreman after another to ask if they could use another unskilled man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and marveled.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was taken to the Bessemer furnace, where they made billets of steel--a dome-like building, the size of a big theater.
<p/>Jurgis stood where the balcony of the theater would have been, and opposite, by the stage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw three giant caldrons, big enough for all the devils of hell to brew their broth in, full of something white and blinding, bubbling and splashing, roaring as if volcanoes were blowing through it--one had to shout to be heard in the place.
<p/>Liquid fire would leap from these caldrons and scatter like bombs below--and men were working there, seeming careless, so that Jurgis caught his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) breath with fright.
<p/>Then a whistle would toot, and across the curtain of the theater would come a little engine with a carload of something to be dumped into one of the receptacles; and then another whistle would toot, down by the stage, and another train would back up--and suddenly, without an instant's warning, one of the giant kettles began to tilt and topple, flinging out a jet of hissing, roaring flame.
<p/>Jurgis shrank back appalled, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought it was an accident; there fell a pillar of white flame, dazzling as the sun, swishing like a huge tree falling in the forest.
<p/>A torrent of sparks swept all the way across the building, overwhelming everything, hiding it from sight; and then Jurgis looked through the fingers of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and saw pouring out of the caldron a cascade of living, leaping fire, white with a whiteness not of earth, scorching the eyeballs.
<p/>Out of regions of wonder it streamed, the very river of life; and the soul leaped up at the sight of it, fled back upon it, swift and resistless, back into far-off lands, where beauty and terror dwell.
<p/>Then the great caldron tilted back again, empty, and Jurgis saw to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) relief that no one was hurt, and turned and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guide out into the sunlight.
<p/>They went through the blast furnaces, through rolling mills where bars of steel were tossed about and chopped like bits of cheese.
<p/>All around and above giant machine arms were flying, giant wheels were turning, great hammers crashing; traveling cranes creaked and groaned overhead, reaching down iron hands and seizing iron prey--it was like standing in the center of the earth, where the machinery of time was revolving.
<p/>By and by they came to the place where steel rails were made; and Jurgis heard a toot behind him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), and jumped out of the way of a car with a white-hot ingot upon it, the size of a man's body.
<p/>There was a sudden crash and the car came to a halt, and the ingot toppled out upon a moving platform, where steel fingers and arms seized hold of it, punching it and prodding it into place, and hurrying it into the grip of huge rollers.
<p/>Then it came out upon the other side, and there were more crashings and clatterings, and over it was flopped, like a pancake on a gridiron, and seized again and rushed back at you through another squeezer.
<p/>Incandescent rainbows shone above it, blue, red, and golden lights played about it; but the stream itself was white, ineffable. So amid deafening uproar it clattered to and fro, growing thinner and flatter and longer.
<p/>The ingot seemed almost a living thing; it did not want to run this mad course, but it was in the grip of fate, it was tumbled on, screeching and clanking and shivering in protest.
<p/>By and by it was long and thin, a great red snake escaped from purgatory; and then, as it slid through the rollers, you would have sworn that it was alive--it writhed and squirmed, and wriggles and shudders passed out through its tail, all but flinging it off by their violence.
<p/>There was no rest for it until it was cold and black--and then it needed only to be cut and straightened to be ready for a railroad.
<p/>It was at the end of this rail's progress that Jurgis got his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) chance. They had to be moved by men with crowbars, and the boss here could use another man.
<p/>It took him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) two hours to get to this place every day and cost him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) a dollar and twenty cents a week.
<p/>As this was out of the question, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) wrapped his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) bedding in a bundle and took it with him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>), and one of his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) fellow workingmen introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) to a Polish lodging-house, where he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) might have the privilege of sleeping upon the floor for ten cents a night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) meals at free-lunch counters, and every Saturday night he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) went home--bedding and all--and took the greater part of his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) money to the family.
<p/>Elzbieta was sorry for this arrangement, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) feared that it would get him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) into the habit of living without them, and once a week was not very often for him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) to see his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) baby; but there was no other way of arranging it.
<p/>There was no chance for a woman at the steelworks, and Marija was now ready for work again, and lured on from day to day by the hope of finding it at the yards.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) coat and set to work on the spot. In a week Jurgis got over his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) sense of helplessness and bewilderment in the rail mill.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) learned to find his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) way about and to take all the miracles and terrors for granted, to work without hearing the rumbling and crashing.
<p/>From blind fear he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) went to the other extreme; he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) became reckless and indifferent, like all the rest of the men, who took but little thought of themselves in the ardor of their work.
<p/>It was wonderful, when one came to think of it, that these men should have taken an interest in the work they did--they had no share in it--they were paid by the hour, and paid no more for being interested.
<p/>and still they would hurry to their task by dangerous short cuts, would use methods that were quicker and more effective in spite of the fact that they were also risky.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) fourth day at his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) work Jurgis saw a man stumble while running in front of a car, and have his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) foot mashed off, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had been there three weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) was witness of a yet more dreadful accident.
<p/>Also they knew that if they were hurt they would be flung aside and forgotten-- There was a row of brick furnaces, shining white through every crack with the molten steel inside.
<p/>Some of these were bulging dangerously, yet men worked before them, wearing blue glasses when they opened and shut the doors.
<p/>As they lay screaming and rolling upon the ground in agony, Jurgis rushed to help them, and as a result he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) lost a good part of the skin from the inside of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) hands.
<p/>The company doctor bandaged it up, but he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) got no other thanks from any one, and was laid up for eight working days without any pay.
<p/>Most fortunately, at this juncture, Elzbieta got the long-awaited chance to go at five o'clock in the morning and help scrub the office floors of one of the packers.
<p/>Jurgis came home and covered himself with blankets to keep warm, and divided his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) time between sleeping and playing with little Antanas.
<p/>Juozapas was away raking in the dump a good part of the time, and Elzbieta and Marija were hunting for more work.
<p/>One morning as Jurgis was passing, a furnace blew out, spraying two men with a shower of liquid fire. Antanas was now over a year and a half old, and was a perfect talking machine.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) learned so fast that every week when Jurgis came home it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had a new child.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would sit down and listen and stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), and give vent to delighted exclamations--<div class="bookquote">``Palauk! Muma! Tu mano szirdele! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The little fellow was now really the one delight that Jurgis had in the world--his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) one hope, his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) one victory. Thank God, Antanas was a boy!
<p/>Nothing had hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), and nothing could hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had come through all the suffering and deprivation unscathed--only shriller-voiced and more determined in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) grip upon life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was a terrible child to manage, was Antanas, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) father did not mind that--he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) and smile to himself with satisfaction.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was as tough as a pine knot, and with the appetite of a wolf. The more of a fighter he (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) was the better--he (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) would need to fight before he (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) got through.
<p/>Jurgis had got the habit of buying the Sunday paper whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) had the money; a most wonderful paper could be had for only five cents, a whole armful, with all the news of the world set forth in big headlines, that Jurgis could spell out slowly, with the children to help him (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) at the long words.
<p/>There was battle and murder and sudden death--it was marvelous how they ever heard about so many entertaining and thrilling happenings; the stories must be all true, for surely no man could have made such things up, and besides, there were pictures of them all, as real as life.
<p/>One of these papers was as good as a circus, and nearly as good as a spree--certainly a most wonderful treat for a workingman, who was tired out and stupefied, and had never had any education, and whose work was one dull, sordid grind, day after day, and year after year, with never a sight of a green field nor an hour's entertainment, nor anything but liquor to stimulate his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>Among other things, these papers had pages full of comical pictures, and these were the main joy in life to little Antanas.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) treasured them up, and would drag them out and make his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) father tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) about them; there were all sorts of animals among them, and Antanas could tell the names of all of them, lying upon the floor for hours and pointing them out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) chubby little fingers.
<p/>Whenever the story was plain enough for Jurgis to make out, Antanas would have it repeated to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would remember it, prattling funny little sentences and mixing it up with other stories in an irresistible fashion.
<p/>Also his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) quaint pronunciation of words was such a delight--and the phrases he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would pick up and remember, the most outlandish and impossible things!
<p/>The first time that the little rascal burst out with <div class="bookquote">``God damn,''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father nearly rolled off the chair with glee; but in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was sorry for this, for Antanas was soon <div class="bookquote">``God-damning''  (<font color='red'><b>Antanas/Dede Antanas</b></font>)</div>everything and everybody.
<p/>And then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was able to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) hands, Jurgis took his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) bedding again and went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) task of shifting rails.
<p/>It was now April, and the snow had given place to cold rains, and the unpaved street in front of Aniele's house was turned into a canal.
<p/>Jurgis would have to wade through it to get home, and if it was late he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) might easily get stuck to his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) waist in the mire.
<p/>Marija had now gotten a place as beef-trimmer in one of the smaller packing plants; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) told himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) lesson now, and would meet with no more accidents--so that at last there was prospect of an end to their long agony.
<p/>They could save money again, and when another winter came they would have a comfortable place; and the children would be off the streets and in school again, and they might set to work to nurse back into life their habits of decency and kindness.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) did not mind this much--it was a promise that summer was coming. So once more Jurgis began to make plans and dream dreams.
<p/>And then one Saturday night he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) jumped off the car and started home, with the sun shining low under the edge of a bank of clouds that had been pouring floods of water into the mud-soaked street.
<p/>There was a rainbow in the sky, and another in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) breast--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had thirty-six hours' rest before him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), and a chance to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) family.
<p/>Then suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) came in sight of the house, and noticed that there was a crowd before the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) ran up the steps and pushed his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) way in, and saw Aniele's kitchen crowded with excited women.
<p/>It reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) so vividly of the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had come home from jail and found Ona dying, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) heart almost stood still.
<p/>'' What's the matter? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) cried. A dead silence had fallen in the room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) saw that every one was staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>).
<p/>'' What's the matter? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) exclaimed again. And then, up in the garret, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) heard sounds of wailing, in Marija's voice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) started for the ladder--and Aniele seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) by the arm. '' No, no! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Don't go up there!''
<p/>'' What is it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) shouted. And the old woman answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) weakly: <div class="bookquote">``It's Antanas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>)'s dead. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was drowned out in the street!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) turned deadly pale, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) caught himself, and for half a minute stood in the middle of the room, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) hands tightly and setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) teeth.
<p/>Chapter 22 Jurgis took the news in a peculiar way. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) pushed Aniele aside and strode into the next room and climbed the ladder.
<p/>In the corner was a blanket, with a form half showing beneath it; and beside it lay Elzbieta, whether crying or in a faint, Jurgis could not tell.
<p/>Marija was pacing the room, screaming and wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) hands tighter yet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) voice was hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>'' How did it happen? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) asked. Marija scarcely heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) agony. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) repeated the question, louder and yet more harshly.
<p/>The sidewalk in front of the house was a platform made of half-rotten boards, about five feet above the level of the sunken street.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) fell off the sidewalk! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) wailed. '' How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) come to be there? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) demanded. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) went--he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) went out to play,'' Marija sobbed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) voice choking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>). '' We couldn't make him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) stay in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) must have got caught in the mud!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) is dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) demanded. '' Ai! ai!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) wailed. '' Yes; we had the doctor. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) took one glance more at the blanket with the little form beneath it, and then turned suddenly to the ladder and climbed down again.
<p/>Then Jurgis stood a few seconds, wavering. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not shed a tear. A silence fell once more in the room as he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) entered.
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) wife had died, Jurgis made for the nearest saloon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not do that now, though he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) week's wages in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went straight to the door, passed out, and started down the street. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) walked and walked, seeing nothing, splashing through mud and water.
<p/>Later on he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sat down upon a step and hid his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands and for half an hour or so he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) did not move.
<p/>It was about sunset, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) went on and on until it was dark, when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was stopped by a railroad crossing.
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would whisper to himself: <div class="bookquote">``Dead! Dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) got up and walked on again. The gates were down, and a long train of freight cars was thundering by.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) stood and watched it; and all at once a wild impulse seized him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), a thought that had been lurking within him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), unspoken, unrecognized, leaped into sudden life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) started down the track, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was past the gate-keeper's shanty he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sprang forward and swung himself on to one of the cars.
<p/>By and by the train stopped again, and Jurgis sprang down and ran under the car, and hid himself upon the truck.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sat, and when the train started again, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) fought a battle with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hands and set his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) teeth together--he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had not wept, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would not--not a tear!
<p/>It was past and over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was done with it--he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would fling it off his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) shoulders, be free of it, the whole business, that night.
<p/>And every time that a thought of it assailed him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)--a tender memory, a trace of a tear--he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) rose up, cursing with rage, and pounded it down.
<p/>It should go like a black, hateful nightmare, and in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would be a new man. He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was fighting for his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) life; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) gnashed his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) teeth together in his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) desperation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had wasted his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had wrecked himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) accursed weakness; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was done with it--he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would tear it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), root and branch!
<p/>There should be no more tears and no more tenderness; he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had had enough of them--they had sold him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) into slavery!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) had been a fool, a fool! Now he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was going to be free, to tear off his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) shackles, to rise up and fight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was glad that the end had come--it had to come some time, and it was just as well now. This was no world for women and children, and the sooner they got out of it the better for them.
<p/>Whatever Antanas might suffer where he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) could suffer no more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would have had he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) stayed upon earth.
<p/>And meantime his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) father had thought the last thought about him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) meant to; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was going to think of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was going to fight for himself, against the world that had baffled him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) and tortured him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>)!
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) went on, tearing up all the flowers from the garden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) soul, and setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) heel upon them.
<p/>The train thundered deafeningly, and a storm of dust blew in his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) face; but though it stopped now and then through the night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) clung where he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was--he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would cling there until he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was driven off, for every mile that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) got from Packingtown meant another load from his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) mind.
<p/>Whenever the cars stopped a warm breeze blew upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), a breeze laden with the perfume of fresh fields, of honeysuckle and clover.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) snuffed it, and it made his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) heart beat wildly--he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was out in the country again! He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was going to live in the country!
<p/>When the dawn came he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was peering out with hungry eyes, getting glimpses of meadows and woods and rivers. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) could stand it no longer, and when the train stopped again he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) crawled out.
<p/>Upon the top of the car was a brakeman, who shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) fist and swore; Jurgis waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) hand derisively, and started across the country.
<p/>Only think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had been a countryman all his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) life; and for three long years he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had never seen a country sight nor heard a country sound!
<p/>Excepting for that one walk when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) left jail, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was too much worried to notice anything, and for a few times that he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had rested in the city parks in the winter time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was out of work, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) had literally never seen a tree!
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) felt like a bird lifted up and borne away upon a gale; he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) stopped and stared at each new sight of wonder--at a herd of cows, and a meadow full of daisies, at hedgerows set thick with June roses, at little birds singing in the trees.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) came to a farm-house, and after getting himself a stick for protection, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) approached it. The farmer was greasing a wagon in front of the barn, and Jurgis went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>).
<p/>'' I would like to get some breakfast, please,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) said. '' Do you want to work?'' said the farmer. ''
<p/>No,'' said Jurgis. '' I don't. '' <div class="bookquote">``Then you can't get anything here,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>snapped the other. '' I meant to pay for it,'' said Jurgis.
<p/>'' Oh,'' said the farmer; and then added sarcastically, <div class="bookquote">``We don't serve breakfast after 7 A.M. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am very hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said Jurgis gravely; <div class="bookquote">``I would like to buy some food.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/>The <div class="bookquote">``woman''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>was more tractable, and for a dime Jurgis secured two thick sandwiches and a piece of pie and two apples.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ask the woman,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>said the farmer, nodding over his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) shoulder. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) walked off eating the pie, as the least convenient thing to carry.
<p/>In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) came to a stream, and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) climbed a fence and walked down the bank, along a woodland path.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) lay for hours, just gazing and drinking in joy; until at last he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) felt sleepy, and lay down in the shade of a bush.
<p/>By and by he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) found a comfortable spot, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) devoured his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) meal, slaking his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) thirst at the stream. When he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) awoke the sun was shining hot in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) sat up and stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) arms, and then gazed at the water sliding by. There was a deep pool, sheltered and silent, below him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), and a sudden wonderful idea rushed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) might have a bath! The water was free, and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) might get into it--all the way into it! It would be the first time that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had been all the way into the water since he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) left Lithuania!
<p/>But later on, what with sickness and cold and hunger and discouragement, and the filthiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) work, and the vermin in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) home, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had given up washing in winter, and in summer only as much of him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) as would go into a basin.
<p/>When Jurgis had first come to the stockyards he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had been as clean as any workingman could well be. He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had had a shower bath in jail, but nothing since--and now he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would have a swim!
<p/>Afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) sat down in the water near the bank, and proceeded to scrub himself--soberly and methodically, scouring every inch of him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) with sand.
<p/>The water was warm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) splashed about like a very boy in his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) glee. While he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was doing it he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would do it thoroughly, and see how it felt to be clean.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) even scrubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) head with sand, and combed what the men called <div class="bookquote">``crumbs''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>out of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) long, black hair, holding his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) head under water as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could, to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could not kill them all.
<p/>Then, seeing that the sun was still hot, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) clothes from the bank and proceeded to wash them, piece by piece; as the dirt and grease went floating off downstream he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) grunted with satisfaction and soused the clothes again, venturing even to dream that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) might get rid of the fertilizer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) hung them all up, and while they were drying he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) lay down in the sun and had another long sleep.
<p/>They were hot and stiff as boards on top, and a little damp on the underside, when he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) awakened; but being hungry, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) put them on and set out again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had no knife, but with some labor he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) broke himself a good stout club, and, armed with this, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) marched down the road again.
<p/>Before long he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) came to a big farmhouse, and turned up the lane that led to it. It was just supper-time, and the farmer was washing his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) hands at the kitchen door.
<p/>'' Please, sir,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``can I have something to eat? I can pay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>To which the farmer responded promptly, <div class="bookquote">``We don't feed tramps here.
<p/>Jurgis went without a word; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) passed round the barn he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) came to a freshly ploughed and harrowed field, in which the farmer had set out some young peach trees; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) walked he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) jerked up a row of them by the roots, more than a hundred trees in all, before he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) reached the end of the field.
<p/>That was his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) answer, and it showed his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) mood; from now on he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was fighting, and the man who hit him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would get all that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) gave, every time.
<p/>Beyond the orchard Jurgis struck through a patch of woods, and then a field of winter grain, and came at last to another road.
<p/>Before long he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) saw another farmhouse, and, as it was beginning to cloud over a little, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) asked here for shelter as well as food.
<p/>Get out!''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>Seeing the farmer eying him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) dubiously, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I'll be glad to sleep in the barn. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I dunno,'' said the other.
<p/>'' Do you smoke?'' '' Sometimes,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``but I'll do it out of doors. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>When the man had assented, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquired, <div class="bookquote">``How much will it cost me?
<p/>I haven't very much money. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I reckon about twenty cents for supper,''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div>replied the farmer. '' I won't charge ye for the barn.
<p/>It was a bountiful meal--there were baked beans and mashed potatoes and asparagus chopped and stewed, and a dish of strawberries, and great, thick slices of bread, and a pitcher of milk.
<p/>Jurgis had not had such a feast since his (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) wedding day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) made a mighty effort to put in his (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) twenty cents' worth.
<p/>They were all of them too hungry to talk; but afterward they sat upon the steps and smoked, and the farmer questioned his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) guest.
<p/>When Jurgis had explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was a workingman from Chicago, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) did not know just whither he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was bound, the other said, <div class="bookquote">``Why don't you stay here and work for me?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' So Jurgis went in, and sat down at the table with the farmer's wife and half a dozen children. ''
<p/>I'm not looking for work just now,'' Jurgis answered. '' I'll pay ye good,'' said the other, eying his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) big form--<div class="bookquote">``a dollar a day and board ye.
<p/>Help's terrible scarce round here.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is that winter as well as summer?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis demanded quickly. '' N--no,'' said the farmer; <div class="bookquote">``I couldn't keep ye after November--I ain't got a big enough place for that.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the farmer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, <div class="bookquote">``that's what I thought. When you get through working your horses this fall, will you turn them out in the snow?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Jurgis was beginning to think for himself nowadays.-RRB- '' It ain't quite the same,'' the farmer answered, seeing the point.
<p/>There ought to be work a strong fellow like you can find to do, in the cities, or some place, in the winter time.''
<p/>when they have to beg or steal to live, then people ask 'em why they don't go into the country, where help is scarce.
<p/>'' '' Yes,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``that's what they all think; and so they crowd into the cities, and ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>The farmer meditated awhile.
<p/>'' How about when your money's gone? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) inquired, finally. '' You'll have to, then, won't you?'' '' Wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>)'s gone,'' said Jurgis; <div class="bookquote">``then I'll see.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) had a long sleep in the barn and then a big breakfast of coffee and bread and oatmeal and stewed cherries, for which the man charged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only fifteen cents, perhaps having been influenced by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arguments.
<p/>It was seldom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got as fair treatment as from this last farmer, and so as time went on he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) learned to shun the houses and to prefer sleeping in the fields.
<p/>When it rained he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would find a deserted building, if he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could, and if not, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would wait until after dark and then, with his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) stick ready, begin a stealthy approach upon a barn.
<p/>Generally he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could get in before the dog got scent of him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), and then he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would hide in the hay and be safe until morning; if not, and the dog attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would rise up and make a retreat in battle order.
<p/>Jurgis was not the mighty man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had once been, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms were still good, and there were few farm dogs he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) needed to hit more than once.
<p/>Before long there came raspberries, and then blackberries, to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) save his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money; and there were apples in the orchards and potatoes in the ground--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) learned to note the places and fill his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets after dark.
<p/>Twice he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even managed to capture a chicken, and had a feast, once in a deserted barn and the other time in a lonely spot alongside of a stream.
<p/>When all of these things failed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money carefully, but without worry--for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could earn more whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chose.
<p/>Half an hour's chopping wood in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lively fashion was enough to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a meal, and when the farmer had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) working he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would sometimes try to bribe him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) to stay.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Then Jurgis bade farewell, and went on his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) way. Such was the beginning of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) life as a tramp. But Jurgis was not staying.
<p/>The old wanderlust had got into his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) blood, the joy of the unbound life, the joy of seeking, of hoping without limit.
<p/>There were mishaps and discomforts--but at least there was always something new; and only think what it meant to a man who for years had been penned up in one place, seeing nothing but one dreary prospect of shanties and factories, to be suddenly set loose beneath the open sky, to behold new landscapes, new places, and new people every hour!
<p/>To a man whose whole life had consisted of doing one certain thing all day, until he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so exhausted that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could only lie down and sleep until the next day--and to be now his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own master, working as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleased and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleased, and facing a new adventure every hour!
<p/>Then, too, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) health came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost youthful vigor, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) joy and power that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had mourned and forgotten!
<p/>It came with a sudden rush, bewildering him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), startling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); it was as if his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dead childhood had come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), laughing and calling!
<p/>What with plenty to eat and fresh air and exercise that was taken as it pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would waken from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sleep and start off not knowing what to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) energy, stretching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arms, laughing, singing old songs of home that came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Now and then, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not help but think of little Antanas, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) should never see again, whose little voice he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) should never hear; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would have to battle with himself.
<p/>Sometimes at night he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would waken dreaming of Ona, and stretch out his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) arms to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>), and wet the ground with his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) tears.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was a free man now, a buccaneer. But in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) would get up and shake himself, and stride away again to battle with the world.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) never asked where he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was nor where he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was going; the country was big enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) knew, and there was no danger of his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) coming to the end of it.
<p/>And of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) could always have company for the asking--everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) went there were men living just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) lived, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was welcome to join.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) was a stranger at the business, but they were not clannish, and they taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) all their tricks--what towns and villages it was best to keep away from, and how to read the secret signs upon the fences, and when to beg and when to steal, and just how to do both.
<p/>They laughed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) ideas of paying for anything with money or with work--for they got all they wanted without either.
<p/>Now and then Jurgis camped out with a gang of them in some woodland haunt, and foraged with them in the neighborhood at night.
<p/>And then among them some one would <div class="bookquote">``take a shine''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to him (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>), and they would go off together and travel for a week, exchanging reminiscences.
<p/>But the vast majority of them had been workingmen, had fought the long fight as Jurgis had, and found that it was a losing fight, and given up.
<p/>Later on he (<font color='blue'><b>Antanas</b></font>) encountered yet another sort of men, those from whose ranks the tramps were recruited, men who were homeless and wandering, but still seeking work--seeking it in the harvest fields.
<p/>Of these there was an army, the huge surplus labor army of society; called into being under the stern system of nature, to do the casual work of the world, the tasks which were transient and irregular, and yet which had to be done.
<p/>They did not know that they were such, of course; they only knew that they sought the job, and that the job was fleeting.
<p/>In the early summer they would be in Texas, and as the crops were ready they would follow north with the season, ending with the fall in Manitoba.
<p/>Then they would seek out the big lumber camps, where there was winter work; or failing in this, would drift to the cities, and live upon what they had managed to save, with the help of such transient work as was there the loading and unloading of steamships and drays, the digging of ditches and the shoveling of snow.
<p/>If there were more of them on hand than chanced to be needed, the weaker ones died off of cold and hunger, again according to the stern system of nature.
<p/>Of these professional tramps a great many had, of course, been shiftless and vicious all their lives. It was in the latter part of July, when Jurgis was in Missouri, that he (<font color='blue'><b>ones</b></font>) came upon the harvest work.
<p/>Here were crops that men had worked for three or four months to prepare, and of which they would lose nearly all unless they could find others to help them for a week or two.
<p/>--agencies were set up and all the cities were drained of men, even college boys were brought by the carload, and hordes of frantic farmers would hold up trains and carry off wagon-loads of men by main force.
<p/>Not that they did not pay them well--any man could get two dollars a day and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) board, and the best men could get two dollars and a half or three.
<p/>The harvest-fever was in the very air, and no man with any spirit in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be in that region and not catch it.
<p/>So all over the land there was a cry for labor Jurgis joined a gang and worked from dawn till dark, eighteen hours a day, for two weeks without a break.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a sum of money that would have been a fortune to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the old days of misery--but what could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do with it now?
<p/>To be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have put it in a bank, and, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were fortunate, get it back again when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted it.
<p/>But Jurgis was now a homeless man, wandering over a continent; and what did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know about banking and drafts and letters of credit?
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carried the money about with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would surely be robbed in the end; and so what was there for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do but enjoy it while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could?
<p/>On a Saturday night he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drifted into a town with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellows; and because it was raining, and there was no other place provided for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to a saloon.
<p/>And there were some who treated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to treat, and there was laughter and singing and good cheer; and then out of the rear part of the saloon a girl's face, red-cheeked and merry, smiled at Jurgis, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart thumped suddenly in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) throat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nodded to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came and sat by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and they had more drink, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went upstairs into a room with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and the wild beast rose up within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and screamed, as it has screamed in the Jungle from the dawn of time.
<p/>And then because of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) memories and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shame, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was glad when others joined them, men and women; and they had more drink and spent the night in wild rioting and debauchery.
<p/>In the van of the surplus-labor army, there followed another, an army of women, they also struggling for life under the stern system of nature.
<p/>Because there were rich men who sought pleasure, there had been ease and plenty for them so long as they were young and beautiful; and later on, when they were crowded out by others younger and more beautiful, they went out to follow upon the trail of the workingmen.
<p/>Sometimes they came of themselves, and the saloon-keepers shared with them; or sometimes they were handled by agencies, the same as the labor army.
<p/>They were in the towns in harvest time, near the lumber camps in the winter, in the cities when the men came there; if a regiment were encamped, or a railroad or canal being made, or a great exposition getting ready, the crowd of women were on hand, living in shanties or saloons or tenement rooms, sometimes eight or ten of them together.
<p/>In the morning Jurgis had not a cent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) went out upon the road again. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was sick and disgusted, but after the new plan of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) crushed his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) feelings down.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had made a fool of himself, but he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could not help it now--all he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could do was to see that it did not happen again.
<p/>This happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) every time, for Jurgis was still a creature of impulse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) pleasures had not yet become business.
<p/>It would be a long time before he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could be like the majority of these men of the road, who roamed until the hunger for drink and for women mastered them, and then went to work with a purpose in mind, and stopped when they had the price of a spree.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) tramped on until exercise and fresh air banished his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) headache, and his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) strength and joy returned. On the contrary, try as he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) would, Jurgis could not help being made miserable by his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) conscience.
<p/>It was the ghost that would not down. It would come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) in the most unexpected places--sometimes it fairly drove him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to drink.
<p/>One night he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was caught by a thunderstorm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) sought shelter in a little house just outside of a town.
<p/>It was a working-man's home, and the owner was a Slav like himself, a new emigrant from White Russia; he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) bade Jurgis welcome in his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) home language, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) to come to the kitchen-fire and dry himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had no bed for him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), but there was straw in the garret, and he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) could make out. The man's wife was cooking the supper, and their children were playing about on the floor.
<p/>Jurgis sat and exchanged thoughts with him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) about the old country, and the places where they had been and the work they had done.
<p/>In the middle of a sentence, however, Jurgis stopped, seeing that the woman had brought a big basin of water and was proceeding to undress her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) youngest baby.
<p/>The rest had crawled into the closet where they slept, but the baby was to have a bath, the workingman explained.
<p/>The nights had begun to be chilly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) mother, ignorant as to the climate in America, had sewed him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) up for the winter; then it had turned warm again, and some kind of a rash had broken out on the child.
<p/>Then they ate, and afterward sat and smoked and talked more about America, and how they found it. The doctor had said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must bathe him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) every night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), foolish woman, believed him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) was about a year old, and a sturdy little fellow, with soft fat legs, and a round ball of a stomach, and eyes as black as coals.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pimples did not seem to bother him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) much, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was wild with glee over the bath, kicking and squirming and chuckling with delight, pulling at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) mother's face and then at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own little toes.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) put him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) into the basin he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sat in the midst of it and grinned, splashing the water over himself and squealing like a little pig.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) spoke in Russian, of which Jurgis knew some; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) spoke it with the quaintest of baby accents--and every word of it brought back to Jurgis some word of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own dead little one, and stabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) like a knife.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sat perfectly motionless, silent, but gripping his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hands tightly, while a storm gathered in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) bosom and a flood heaped itself up behind his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>And in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could bear it no more, but buried his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hands and burst into tears, to the alarm and amazement of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hosts.
<p/>Jurgis scarcely heard the explanation; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was watching the baby. Between the shame of this and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) woe Jurgis could not stand it, and got up and rushed out into the rain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went on and on down the road, finally coming to a black woods, where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hid and wept as if his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) heart would break.
<p/>Ah, what agony was that, what despair, when the tomb of memory was rent open and the ghosts of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) old life came forth to scourge him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!
<p/>What terror to see what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been and now could never be--to see Ona and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) child and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own dead self stretching out their arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), calling to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) across a bottomless abyss--and to know that they were gone from him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) forever, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) writhing and suffocating in the mire of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own vileness!
<p/>All the joy went out of tramping as soon as a man could not keep warm in the hay; and, like many thousands of others, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deluded himself with the hope that by coming early he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could avoid the rush.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brought fifteen dollars with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), hidden away in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoes, a sum which had been saved from the saloon-keepers, not so much by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conscience, as by the fear which filled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the thought of being out of work in the city in the winter time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) traveled upon the railroad with several other men, hiding in freight cars at night, and liable to be thrown off at any time, regardless of the speed of the train.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reached the city he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left the rest, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had money and they did not, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meant to save himself in this fight.
<p/>Chapter 23 Early in the fall Jurgis set out for Chicago again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Early</b></font>) would bring to it all the skill that practice had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Early</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Early</b></font>) would stand, whoever fell.
<p/>On fair nights he (<font color='blue'><b>Early</b></font>) would sleep in the park or on a truck or an empty barrel or box, and when it was rainy or cold he (<font color='blue'><b>Early</b></font>) would stow himself upon a shelf in a ten-cent lodging-house, or pay three cents for the privileges of a <div class="bookquote">``squatter''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in a tenement hallway.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) would eat at free lunches, five cents a meal, and never a cent more--so he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) might keep alive for two months and more, and in that time he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) would surely find a job.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) would have to bid farewell to his (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) summer cleanliness, of course, for he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) would come out of the first night's lodging with his (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) clothes alive with vermin.
<p/>There was no place in the city where he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) could wash even his (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) face, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) went down to the lake front--and there it would soon be all ice.
<p/>First he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) went to the steel mill and the harvester works, and found that his (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) places there had been filled long ago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) was careful to keep away from the stockyards--he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) was a single man now, he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) told himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) meant to stay one, to have his (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) wages for his (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) own when he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) got a job.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) began the long, weary round of factories and warehouses, tramping all day, from one end of the city to the other, finding everywhere from ten to a hundred men ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) watched the newspapers, too--but no longer was he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) to be taken in by smooth-spoken agents. He (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) had been told of all those tricks while ``on the road.
<p/>It was a call for a hundred laborers, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) thought it was a <div class="bookquote">``fake,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) went because the place was near by.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) found a line of men a block long, but as a wagon chanced to come out of an alley and break the line, he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) chance and sprang to seize a place.
<p/>Men threatened him (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) and tried to throw him (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) out, but he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) cursed and made a disturbance to attract a policeman, upon which they subsided, knowing that if the latter interfered it would be to <div class="bookquote">``fire''  (<font color='red'><b>a policeman</b></font>)</div>them all.
<p/>'' In the end it was through a newspaper that he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) got a job, after nearly a month of seeking. An hour or two later he (<font color='blue'><b>squatter</b></font>) entered a room and confronted a big Irishman behind a desk.
<p/>'' the man inquired; and whether it was a good angel that put it into Jurgis's mind, or an intuition of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sharpened wits, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was moved to answer, <div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Ever worked in Chicago before? <div class="bookquote">``Where do you come from?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Kansas City, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Any references?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, sir. I'm just an unskilled man.
<p/>I've got good arms. '' <div class="bookquote">``I want men for hard work--it's all underground, digging tunnels for telephones. Maybe it won't suit you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I'm willing, sir--anything for me. What's the pay?'' <div class="bookquote">``Fifteen cents an hour. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'm willing, sir.'' '' All right; go back there and give your name.
<p/>The tunnel was a peculiar one for telephone wires; it was about eight feet high, and with a level floor nearly as wide.
<p/>It had innumerable branches--a perfect spider web beneath the city; Jurgis walked over half a mile with his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) gang to the place where they were to work.
<p/>'' So within half an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was at work, far underneath the streets of the city. Stranger yet, the tunnel was lighted by electricity, and upon it was laid a double-tracked, narrow-gauge railroad!
<p/>But Jurgis was not there to ask questions, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stranger</b></font>) did not give the matter a thought. It was nearly a year afterward that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stranger</b></font>) finally learned the meaning of this whole affair.
<p/>The City Council had passed a quiet and innocent little bill allowing a company to construct telephone conduits under the city streets; and upon the strength of this, a great corporation had proceeded to tunnel all Chicago with a system of railway freight-subways.
<p/>In the city there was a combination of employers, representing hundreds of millions of capital, and formed for the purpose of crushing the labor unions.
<p/>The chief union which troubled it was the teamsters'; and when these freight tunnels were completed, connecting all the big factories and stores with the railroad depots, they would have the teamsters' union by the throat.
<p/>Now and then there were rumors and murmurs in the Board of Aldermen, and once there was a committee to investigate--but each time another small fortune was paid over, and the rumors died away; until at last the city woke up with a start to find the work completed.
<p/>There was a tremendous scandal, of course; it was found that the city records had been falsified and other crimes committed, and some of Chicago's big capitalists got into jail--figuratively speaking.
<p/>The aldermen declared that they had had no idea of it all, in spite of the fact that the main entrance to the work had been in the rear of the saloon of one of them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was so rejoiced that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) treated himself to a spree that night, and with the balance of his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) money he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) hired himself a place in a tenement room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) slept upon a big homemade straw mattress along with four other workingmen.
<p/>It was in a newly opened cut that Jurgis worked, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had an all-winter job. This was one dollar a week, and for four more he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) got his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) food in a boardinghouse near his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) work.
<p/>At the outset he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had to pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) digging tools, and also to buy a pair of heavy boots, since his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) shoes were falling to pieces, and a flannel shirt, since the one he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had worn all summer was in shreds.
<p/>This would leave him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) four dollars extra each week, an unthinkable sum for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) spent a week meditating whether or not he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) should also buy an overcoat.
<p/>There was one belonging to a Hebrew collar button peddler, who had died in the room next to him (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>), and which the landlady was holding for her (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) rent; in the end, however, Jurgis decided to do without it, as he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) was to be underground by day and in bed at night.
<p/>From now on Jurgis worked from seven o'clock until half-past five, with half an hour for dinner; which meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) never saw the sunlight on weekdays.
<p/>In the evenings there was no place for him (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) to go except a barroom; no place where there was light and warmth, where he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) could hear a little music or sit with a companion and talk.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) had now no home to go to; he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) had no affection left in his (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) life--only the pitiful mockery of it in the camaraderie of vice.
<p/>On Sundays the churches were open--but where was there a church in which an ill-smelling workingman, with vermin crawling upon his (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) neck, could sit without seeing people edge away and look annoyed?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) had, of course, his (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) corner in a close though unheated room, with a window opening upon a blank wall two feet away; and also he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) had the bare streets, with the winter gales sweeping through them; besides this he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) had only the saloons--and, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) had to drink to stay in them.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) drank now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) was free to make himself at home, to gamble with dice or a pack of greasy cards, to play at a dingy pool table for money, or to look at a beer-stained pink <div class="bookquote">``sporting paper,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with pictures of murderers and half-naked women.
<p/>It was for such pleasures as these that he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) money; and such was his (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) life during the six weeks and a half that he (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) toiled for the merchants of Chicago, to enable them to break the grip of their teamsters' union.
<p/>This was an unfortunate decision, however, for it drove him (<font color='blue'><b>peddler</b></font>) more quickly than ever into the saloons. In a work thus carried out, not much thought was given to the welfare of the laborers.
<p/>On an average, the tunneling cost a life a day and several manglings; it was seldom, however, that more than a dozen or two men heard of any one accident.
<p/>The work was all done by the new boring machinery, with as little blasting as possible; but there would be falling rocks and crushed supports, and premature explosions--and in addition all the dangers of railroading.
<p/>So it was that one night, as Jurgis was on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) way out with his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gang, an engine and a loaded car dashed round one of the innumerable right-angle branches and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) upon the shoulder, hurling him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) against the concrete wall and knocking him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) senseless.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eyes again it was to the clanging of the bell of an ambulance. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was lying in it, covered by a blanket, and it was threading its way slowly through the holiday-shopping crowds.
<p/>They took him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to the county hospital, where a young surgeon set his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) arm; then he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was washed and laid upon a bed in a ward with a score or two more of maimed and mangled men.
<p/>Every year there were scandals and investigations in this institution, the newspapers charging that doctors were allowed to try fantastic experiments upon the patients; but Jurgis knew nothing of this
<p/>--his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) only complaint was that they used to feed him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) upon tinned meat, which no man who had ever worked in Packingtown would feed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dog.
<p/>Jurgis had often wondered just who ate the canned corned beef and <div class="bookquote">``roast beef''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>of the stockyards; now he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to understand--that it was what you might call <div class="bookquote">``graft meat,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>put up to be sold to public officials and contractors, and eaten by soldiers and sailors, prisoners and inmates of institutions, <div class="bookquote">``shantymen''  (<font color='red'><b>inmates</b></font>)</div>and gangs of railroad laborers.
<p/>Jurgis spent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Christmas in this hospital, and it was the pleasantest Christmas he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had had in America. Jurgis was ready to leave the hospital at the end of two weeks.
<p/>This did not mean that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm was strong and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was able to go back to work, but simply that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get along without further attention, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place was needed for some one worse off than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was utterly helpless, and had no means of keeping himself alive in the meantime, was something which did not concern the hospital authorities, nor any one else in the city.
<p/>As it chanced, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been hurt on a Monday, and had just paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last week's board and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) room rent, and spent nearly all the balance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Saturday's pay.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had less than seventy-five cents in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets, and a dollar and a half due him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for the day's work he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was hurt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might possibly have sued the company, and got some damages for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) injuries, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know this, and it was not the company's business to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) landlady, who had rented his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place and had no other for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and then to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) boardinghouse keeper, who looked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) over and questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must certainly be helpless for a couple of months, and had boarded there only six weeks, she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) decided very quickly that it would not be worth the risk to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on trust.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went and got his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pay and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tools, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left in a pawnshop for fifty cents. So Jurgis went out into the streets, in a most dreadful plight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no overcoat, and no place to go, and two dollars and sixty-five cents in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pocket, with the certainty that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not earn another cent for months.
<p/>The snow meant no chance to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must walk along and see others shoveling, vigorous and active--and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left arm bound to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not hope to tide himself over by odd jobs of loading trucks; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not even sell newspapers or carry satchels, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now at the mercy of any rival.
<p/>It was bitterly cold, and a heavy snow was falling, beating into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face. Words could not paint the terror that came over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) realized all this.
<p/>There would be no consideration for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) because of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) weakness--it was no one's business to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in such distress, to make the fight the least bit easier for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took to begging, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be at a disadvantage, for reasons which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to discover in good time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was like a wounded animal in the forest; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was forced to compete with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemies upon unequal terms. In the beginning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not think of anything except getting out of the awful cold.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went into one of the saloons he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been wont to frequent and bought a drink, and then stood by the fire shivering and waiting to be ordered out.
<p/>According to an unwritten law, the buying a drink included the privilege of loafing for just so long; then one had to buy another drink or move on.
<p/>That Jurgis was an old customer entitled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to a somewhat longer stop; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been away two weeks, and was evidently ``on the bum.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) might plead and tell his (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``hard luck story,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but that would not help him (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) much; a saloon-keeper who was to be moved by such means would soon have his (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) place jammed to the doors with <div class="bookquote">``hoboes''  (<font color='red'><b>a saloon-keeper</b></font>)</div>on a day like this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) was so hungry this time that he (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) could not resist the hot beef stew, an indulgence which cut short his (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) stay by a considerable time.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) was again told to move on, he (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) made his (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) way to a <div class="bookquote">``tough''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>place in the <div class="bookquote">``Levee''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>district, where now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) had gone with a certain rat-eyed Bohemian workingman of his (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) acquaintance, seeking a woman.
<p/>'' So Jurgis went out into another place, and paid another nickel. It was Jurgis's vain hope that here the proprietor would let him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) remain as a ``sitter.
<p/>In low-class places, in the dead of winter, saloon-keepers would often allow one or two forlorn-looking bums who came in covered with snow or soaked with rain to sit by the fire and look miserable to attract custom.
<p/>A workingman would come in, feeling cheerful after his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) day's work was over, and it would trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) to have to take his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) glass with such a sight under his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) nose; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) would call out: ``Hello, Bub, what's the matter?
<p/>And then the other would begin to pour out some tale of misery, and the man would say, ``Come have a glass, and maybe that'll brace you up.
<p/>And so they would drink together, and if the tramp was sufficiently wretched-looking, or good enough at the <div class="bookquote">``gab,''  (<font color='red'><b>the tramp</b></font>)</div>they might have two; and if they were to discover that they were from the same country, or had lived in the same city or worked at the same trade, they might sit down at a table and spend an hour or two in talk--and before they got through the saloon-keeper would have taken in a dollar.
<p/>'' You look as if you'd been up against it!'' '' All of this might seem diabolical, but the saloon-keeper was in no wise to blame for it.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) does not, some one else will; and the saloon-keeper, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is also an alderman, is apt to be in debt to the big brewers, and on the verge of being sold out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was in the same plight as the manufacturer who has to adulterate and misrepresent his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) product. The market for <div class="bookquote">``sitters''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>was glutted that afternoon, however, and there was no place for Jurgis.
<p/>In all he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had to spend six nickels in keeping a shelter over him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) that frightful day, and then it was just dark, and the station houses would not open until midnight!
<p/>At the last place, however, there was a bartender who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) and liked him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>), and let him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) doze at one of the tables until the boss came back; and also, as he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was going out, the man gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a tip--on the next block there was a religious revival of some sort, with preaching and singing, and hundreds of hoboes would go there for the shelter and warmth.
<p/>Jurgis went straightway, and saw a sign hung out, saying that the door would open at seven-thirty; then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked, or half ran, a block, and hid awhile in a doorway and then ran again, and so on until the hour.
<p/>At the end he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was all but frozen, and fought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way in with the rest of the throng -LRB-at the risk of having his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arm broken again-RRB-, and got close to the big stove.
<p/>By eight o'clock the place was so crowded that the speakers ought to have been flattered; the aisles were filled halfway up, and at the door men were packed tight enough to walk upon.
<p/>First they sang a hymn, and then one of the three, a tall, smooth-shaven man, very thin, and wearing black spectacles, began an address.
<p/>Jurgis heard smatterings of it, for the reason that terror kept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) awake--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) snored abominably, and to have been put out just then would have been like a sentence of death to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>There were three elderly gentlemen in black upon the platform, and a young lady who played the piano in front. The evangelist was preaching <div class="bookquote">``sin and redemption,''  (<font color='red'><b>The evangelist</b></font>)</div>the infinite grace of God and His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pardon for human frailty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was very much in earnest, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) meant well, but Jurgis, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) listened, found his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul filled with hatred.
<p/>What did he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) know about sin and suffering--with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) smooth, black coat and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) neatly starched collar, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) body warm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) belly full, and money in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pocket--and lecturing men who were struggling for their lives, men at the death grapple with the demon powers of hunger and cold!--This, of course, was unfair; but Jurgis felt that these men were out of touch with the life they discussed, that they were unfitted to solve its problems; nay, they themselves were part of the problem--they were part of the order established that was crushing men down and beating them!
<p/>They were of the triumphant and insolent possessors; they had a hall, and a fire, and food and clothing and money, and so they might preach to hungry men, and the hungry men must be humble and listen!
<p/>They were trying to save their souls--and who but a fool could fail to see that all that was the matter with their souls was that they had not been able to get a decent existence for their bodies?
<p/>At eleven the meeting closed, and the desolate audience filed out into the snow, muttering curses upon the few traitors who had got repentance and gone up on the platform.
<p/>It was yet an hour before the station house would open, and Jurgis had no overcoat--and was weak from a long illness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) was obliged to run hard to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) blood moving at all--and then he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) came back to the station house and found a crowd blocking the street before the door!
<p/>This was in the month of January, 1904, when the country was on the verge of <div class="bookquote">``hard times,''  (<font color='red'><b>a half men</b></font>)</div>and the newspapers were reporting the shutting down of factories every day--it was estimated that a million and a half men were thrown out of work before the spring.
<p/>So all the hiding places of the city were crowded, and before that station house door men fought and tore each other like savage beasts.
<p/>When at last the place was jammed and they shut the doors, half the crowd was still outside; and Jurgis, with his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) helpless arm, was among them.
<p/>During that hour he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) nearly perished. There was no choice then but to go to a lodging-house and spend another dime.
<p/>It really broke his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) heart to do this, at half-past twelve o'clock, after he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had wasted the night at the meeting and on the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) would be turned out of the lodging-house promptly at seven--they had the shelves which served as bunks so contrived that they could be dropped, and any man who was slow about obeying orders could be tumbled to the floor.
<p/>At the end of six days every cent of Jurgis' money was gone; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went out on the streets to beg for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>This was one day, and the cold spell lasted for fourteen of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would begin as soon as the business of the city was moving.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would sally forth from a saloon, and, after making sure there was no policeman in sight, would approach every likely-looking person who passed him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>), telling his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) woeful story and pleading for a nickel or a dime.
<p/>Then when he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) got one, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) would dart round the corner and return to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) base to get warm; and his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) victim, seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) do this, would go away, vowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) would never give a cent to a beggar again.
<p/>The victim never paused to ask where else Jurgis could have gone under the circumstances--where he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>), the victim, would have gone.
<p/>At the saloon Jurgis could not only get more food and better food than he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) could buy in any restaurant for the same money, but a drink in the bargain to warm him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) up.
<p/>Also he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) could find a comfortable seat by a fire, and could chat with a companion until he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was as warm as toast.
<p/>Part of the saloon-keeper's business was to offer a home and refreshments to beggars in exchange for the proceeds of their foragings; and was there any one else in the whole city who would do this--would the victim have done it himself?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) was just out of the hospital, and desperately sick-looking, and with a helpless arm; also he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had no overcoat, and shivered pitifully.
<p/>But, alas, it was again the case of the honest merchant, who finds that the genuine and unadulterated article is driven to the wall by the artistic counterfeit.
<p/>At the saloon, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) felt at home. Poor Jurgis might have been expected to make a successful beggar. Jurgis, as a beggar, was simply a blundering amateur in competition with organized and scientific professionalism.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) was just out of the hospital--but the story was worn threadbare, and how could he (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) prove it? He (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>beggar</b></font>) arm in a sling--and it was a device a regular beggar's little boy would have scorned.
<p/>As to his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) being without an overcoat, among them you would meet men you could swear had on nothing but a ragged linen duster and a pair of cotton trousers--so cleverly had they concealed the several suits of all-wool underwear beneath.
<p/>Many of these professional mendicants had comfortable homes, and families, and thousands of dollars in the bank; some of them had retired upon their earnings, and gone into the business of fitting out and doctoring others, or working children at the trade.
<p/>There were some who had both their arms bound tightly to their sides, and padded stumps in their sleeves, and a sick child hired to carry a cup for them.
<p/>There were some who had no legs, and pushed themselves upon a wheeled platform--some who had been favored with blindness, and were led by pretty little dogs.
<p/>Some less fortunate had mutilated themselves or burned themselves, or had brought horrible sores upon themselves with chemicals; you might suddenly encounter upon the street a man holding out to you a finger rotting and discolored with gangrene--or one with livid scarlet wounds half escaped from their filthy bandages.
<p/>These desperate ones were the dregs of the city's cesspools, wretches who hid at night in the rain-soaked cellars of old ramshackle tenements, in <div class="bookquote">``stale-beer dives''  (<font color='red'><b>wretches</b></font>)</div>and opium joints, with abandoned women in the last stages of the harlot's progress--women who had been kept by Chinamen and turned away at last to die.
<p/>Every day the police net would drag hundreds of them off the streets, and in the detention hospital you might see them, herded together in a miniature inferno, with hideous, beastly faces, bloated and leprous with disease, laughing, shouting, screaming in all stages of drunkenness, barking like dogs, gibbering like apes, raving and tearing themselves in delirium.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was pale and shivering--but they were made up with cosmetics, and had studied the art of chattering their teeth. Chapter 24
<p/>In the face of all his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) handicaps, Jurgis was obliged to make the price of a lodging, and of a drink every hour or two, under penalty of freezing to death.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) saw the world of civilization then more plainly than ever he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had seen it before; a world in which nothing counted but brutal might, an order devised by those who possessed it for the subjugation of those who did not.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was one of the latter; and all outdoors, all life, was to him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) one colossal prison, which he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) paced like a pent-up tiger, trying one bar after another, and finding them all beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) power.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had lost in the fierce battle of greed, and so was doomed to be exterminated; and all society was busied to see that he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) did not escape the sentence.
<p/>Everywhere that he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) turned were prison bars, and hostile eyes following him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>); the well-fed, sleek policemen, from whose glances he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) shrank, and who seemed to grip their clubs more tightly when they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>); the saloon-keepers, who never ceased to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was in their places, who were jealous of every moment he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) lingered after he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had paid his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) money; the hurrying throngs upon the streets, who were deaf to his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) entreaties, oblivious of his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) very existence--and savage and contemptuous when he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) forced himself upon them.
<p/>Day after day he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) roamed about in the arctic cold, his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) soul filled full of bitterness and despair. They had their own affairs, and there was no place for him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) among them.
<p/>There was no place for him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) anywhere--every direction he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) gaze, this fact was forced upon him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>): Everything was built to express it to him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>): the residences, with their heavy walls and bolted doors, and basement windows barred with iron; the great warehouses filled with the products of the whole world, and guarded by iron shutters and heavy gates; the banks with their unthinkable billions of wealth, all buried in safes and vaults of steel.
<p/>And then one day there befell Jurgis the one adventure of his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) life. It was late at night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had failed to get the price of a lodging.
<p/>Snow was falling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) had been out so long that he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was covered with it, and was chilled to the bone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was working among the theater crowds, flitting here and there, taking large chances with the police, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) desperation half hoping to be arrested.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) saw a blue-coat start toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>), however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) heart failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) dashed down a side street and fled a couple of blocks.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) stopped again he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) saw a man coming toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>), and placed himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) path. '' Please, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) began, in the usual formula, <div class="bookquote">``will you give me the price of a lodging?
<p/>I've had a broken arm, and I can't work, and I've not a cent in my pocket. I'm an honest working-man, sir, and I never begged before!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Jurgis usually went on until he (<font color='blue'><b>Snow</b></font>) was interrupted, but this man did not interrupt, and so at last he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to a breathless stop.
<p/>It's not my fault, sir-- The other had halted, and Jurgis suddenly noticed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood a little unsteadily. '' Whuzzat you say?
<p/>Jurgis began again, speaking more slowly and distinctly; before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was half through the other put out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and rested it upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) queried suddenly, in a thick voice. '' Poor ole chappie! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' Been up--hic--up--against it, hey?'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lurched toward Jurgis, and the hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulder became an arm about his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neck.
<p/>'' Up against it myself, ole sport,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a hard ole world. '' They were close to a lamppost, and Jurgis got a glimpse of the other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore a silk hat and a rich soft overcoat with a fur collar; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smiled at Jurgis with benignant sympathy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a young fellow--not much over eighteen, with a handsome boyish face. '' I'm hard up, too, my goo' fren','' he (<font color='blue'><b>goo</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I've got cruel parents, or I'd set you up. Whuzzamatter whizyer? '' '' I've been in the hospital.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hospital!''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the young fellow, still smiling sweetly, <div class="bookquote">``thass too bad!
<p/>Same's my Aunt Polly-- hic-- my Aunt Polly's in the hospital, too-- ole auntie's been havin' twins! Whuzzamatter whiz you?''  (<font color='red'><b>the fellow</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I've got a broken arm--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis began. '' So,'' said the other, sympathetically. '' That ain't so bad--you get over that. I wish somebody'd break my arm, ole chappie--
<p/>damfidon't! Then they'd treat me better--hic-- hole me up, ole sport! Whuzzit you wamme do?'' '' I'm hungry, sir,'' said Jurgis.
<p/>'' Hungry! Why don't you hassome supper?'' <div class="bookquote">``I've got no money, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No money! Ho, ho--less be chums, ole boy--

<p/>'' No home! Stranger in the city, hey? Goo' God, thass bad! Better come home wiz me--yes, by Harry , thass the trick, you'll come home an' hassome supper--hic--wiz me!
<p/>Awful lonesome--nobody home! Guv`ner gone abroad-- Bubby on's honeymoon-- Polly havin' twins--every damn soul gone away! Nuff--hic-- nuff to drive a feller to drink, I say!
<p/>Only ole Ham standin' by, passin' plates--damfican eat like that, no sir! The club for me every time, my boy, I say.
<p/>But then they won't lemme sleep there--guv`ner's orders, by Harry--home every night, sir! Ever hear anythin' like that? ' Every mornin' do?'
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). ' No, sir, every night, or no allowance at all, sir.' Thass my guv`ner--`nice as nails, by Harry!
<p/>Tole ole Ham to watch me, too--servants spyin' on me--whuzyer think that, my fren'? A nice, quiet--hic--goodhearted young feller like me, an' his (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) daddy can't go to Europe--hup!--an' leave him (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) in peace!
<p/>Ain't that a shame, sir? An' I gotter go home every evenin' an' miss all the fun, by Harry! Thass whuzzamatter now--thass why I'm here!

<p/>Farewell, farewell, my own true love--farewell, farewehell, my--own true--love!' '' This last was a song, and the young gentleman's voice rose mournful and wailing, while he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) swung upon Jurgis's neck.
<p/>The latter was glancing about nervously, lest some one should approach. They were still alone, however. '' But I came all right, all right,'' continued the youngster, aggressively, <div class="bookquote">``I can--hic
<p/>--I can have my own way when I want it, by Harry--Freddie Jones is a hard man to handle when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) gets goin'! '
<p/>No, sir,' says I, `by thunder, and I don't need anybody goin' home with me, either --whujja take me for, hey?
<p/>Think I'm drunk, dontcha, hey?--I know you! But I'm no more drunk than you are, Kittens,' says I to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). And then says she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), `Thass true, Freddie dear' -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s a smart one, is Kitty-RRB-, '
<p/>but I'm stayin' in the flat, an' you're goin' out into the cold, cold night!' `Put it in a pome, lovely Kitty,' says I. `No jokin', Freddie, my boy,' says she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>). '
<p/>Lemme call a cab now, like a good dear'--but I can call my own cabs, dontcha fool yourself--and I know what I'm a-doin', you bet!
<p/>Say, my fren', whatcha say--willye come home an' see me, an' hassome supper? Come `long like a good feller-- don't be haughty!
<p/>You're up against it, same as me, an' you can unerstan' a feller; your heart's in the right place, by Harry--come `long, ole chappie, an' we'll light up the house,
<p/>an' have some fizz, an' we'll raise hell , we will--whoop-la! S'long's I'm inside the house I can do as I please--the guv`ner's own very orders, b`God!
<p/>Jurgis was trying to think what to do--he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could not pass any crowded place with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) new acquaintance without attracting attention and being stopped.
<p/>Hip! hip! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the youngster</b></font>)</div>They had started down the street, arm in arm, the young man pushing Jurgis along, half dazed. It was only because of the falling snow that people who passed here did not notice anything wrong.
<p/>Suddenly, therefore, Jurgis stopped. '' Is it very far? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquired. '' Not very,'' said the other, <div class="bookquote">``Tired, are you, though?
<p/>Well, we'll ride--whatcha say? Good! Call a cab! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>And then, gripping Jurgis tight with one hand, the young fellow began searching his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets with the other.
<p/>'' You call, ole sport, an' I'll pay,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suggested. '' How's that , hey? '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pulled out from somewhere a big roll of bills.
<p/>It was more money than Jurgis had ever seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared at it with startled eyes.
<p/>'' Looks like a lot, hey?'' said Master Freddie, fumbling with it. '' Fool you, though, ole chappie-- they're all little ones!
<p/>I'll be busted in one week more, sure thing--word of honor. An' not a cent more till the first--hic-- guv`ner's orders--hic--not a cent, by Harry!
<p/>Nuff to set a feller crazy, it is. I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>feller</b></font>) a cable, this af`noon--thass one reason more why I'm goin' home. '
<p/>Hangin' on the verge of starvation,' I says--`for the honor of the family--hic--sen' me some bread. Hunger will compel me to join you--Freddie.'
<p/>Thass what I wired him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>), by Harry, an' I mean it--I'll run away from school, b`God, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) don't sen' me some.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might grab that wad of bills and be out of sight in the darkness before the other could collect his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wits.
<p/>'' After this fashion the young gentleman continued to prattle on--and meantime Jurgis was trembling with excitement. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) do it?
<p/>What better had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to hope for, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) waited longer? But Jurgis had never committed a crime in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hesitated half a second too long.
<p/>'' Freddie'' got one bill loose, and then stuffed the rest back into his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) trousers' pocket. '' Here, ole man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you take it.
<p/>They were in front of a saloon; and by the light of the window Jurgis saw that it was a hundred-dollar bill!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held it out fluttering. '' You take it,'' the other repeated. <div class="bookquote">``Pay the cabbie an' keep the change--I've got--hic--no head for business!
<p/>Guv`ner says so hisself, an' the guv`ner knows--the guv`ner's got a head for business, you bet! ' All right, guv`ner,' I told him (<font color='blue'><b>guv</b></font>), `you run the show, and I'll take the tickets!'
<p/>An' so he (<font color='blue'><b>guv</b></font>) set Aunt Polly to watch me--hic-- an' now Polly's off in the hospital havin' twins, an' me out raisin' Cain!
<p/>Hello, there! Hey! Call him (<font color='blue'><b>Cain</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A cab was driving by; and Jurgis sprang and called, and it swung round to the curb.
<p/>Master Freddie clambered in with some difficulty, and Jurgis had started to follow, when the driver shouted: <div class="bookquote">``Hi, there! Get out--you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the driver</b></font>)</div><p/>Jurgis hesitated, and was half obeying; but his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) companion broke out: <div class="bookquote">``Whuzzat? Whuzzamatter wiz you, hey? ''  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>And the cabbie subsided, and Jurgis climbed in.
<p/>The youngster leaned back and snuggled up to Jurgis, murmuring contentedly; in half a minute he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) was sound asleep, Jurgis sat shivering, speculating as to whether he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) might not still be able to get hold of the roll of bills.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) was afraid to try to go through his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) companion's pockets, however; and besides the cabbie might be on the watch.
<p/>Then Freddie gave a number on the Lake Shore Drive, and the carriage started away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) had the hundred safe, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) would have to be content with that.
<p/>At the end of half an hour or so the cab stopped. They were out on the waterfront, and from the east a freezing gale was blowing off the ice-bound lake.
<p/>'' Here we are,'' called the cabbie, and Jurgis awakened his (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) companion. Master Freddie sat up with a start. '' Hello!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Where are we? Whuzzis? Who are you, hey? Oh, yes, sure nuff! Mos' forgot you--hic--ole chappie! Home, are we? Lessee!
<p/>Br-r-r--it's cold! Yes--come `long-- we're home-- it ever so--hic--humble!'' Before them there loomed an enormous granite pile, set far back from the street, and occupying a whole block.
<p/>By the light of the driveway lamps Jurgis could see that it had towers and huge gables, like a medieval castle.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) thought that the young fellow must have made a mistake--it was inconceivable to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) that any person could have a home like a hotel or the city hall.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) followed in silence, and they went up the long flight of steps, arm in arm. '' There's a button here, ole sport,'' said Master Freddie.
<p/>'' Hole my arm while I find her (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>)! Steady, now--oh, yes, here she (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) is! Saved! '' A bell rang, and in a few seconds the door was opened.
<p/>A man in blue livery stood holding it, and gazing before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), silent as a statue. They stood for a moment blinking in the light.
<p/>Jurgis's heart was beating wildly; it was a bold thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do--into what strange unearthly place he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was venturing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no idea.
<p/>Then Jurgis felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion pulling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped in, and the blue automaton closed the door. Aladdin entering his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cave could not have been more excited.
<p/>The place where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood was dimly lighted; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see a vast hall, with pillars fading into the darkness above, and a great staircase opening at the far end of it.
<p/>The floor was of tesselated marble, smooth as glass, and from the walls strange shapes loomed out, woven into huge portieres in rich, harmonious colors, or gleaming from paintings, wonderful and mysterious-looking in the half-light, purple and red and golden, like sunset glimmers in a shadowy forest.
<p/>The man in livery had moved silently toward them; Master Freddie took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) hat and handed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>), and then, letting go of Jurgis' arm, tried to get out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) overcoat.
<p/>After two or three attempts he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) accomplished this, with the lackey's help, and meantime a second man had approached, a tall and portly personage, solemn as an executioner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) bore straight down upon Jurgis, who shrank away nervously; he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) seized him (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) by the arm without a word, and started toward the door with him (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>).
<p/>Then suddenly came Master Freddie's voice, <div class="bookquote">``Hamilton! My fren' will remain wiz me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Master Freddie</b></font>)</div>The man paused and half released Jurgis.
<p/>'' Come `long ole chappie,'' said the other, and Jurgis started toward him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Master Frederick!''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the man. '' See that the cabbie--hic--is paid,'' was the other's response; and he (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) linked his (<font color='blue'><b>cabbie</b></font>) arm in Jurgis'.
<p/>The stout man in uniform signaled to the other, who went out to the cab, while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) followed Jurgis and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) young master.
<p/>Jurgis was about to say, <div class="bookquote">``I have the money for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) restrained himself. They went down the great hall, and then turned.
<p/>Before them were two huge doors. <div class="bookquote">``Hamilton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>said Master Freddie. '' Well, sir?'' said the other. '' Whuzzamatter wizze dinin'-room doors?''
<p/>'' Nothing is the matter, sir.'' '' Then why dontcha openum? '' The man rolled them back; another vista lost itself in the darkness.
<p/>Lights,'' commanded Master Freddie; and the butler pressed a button, and a flood of brilliant incandescence streamed from above, half-blinding Jurgis.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) stared; and little by little he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) made out the great apartment, with a domed ceiling from which the light poured, and walls that were one enormous painting--nymphs and dryads dancing in a flower-strewn glade--Diana with her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hounds and horses, dashing headlong through a mountain streamlet--a group of maidens bathing in a forest pool--all life-size, and so real that Jurgis thought that it was some work of enchantment, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) was in a dream palace.
<p/>Then his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) eye passed to the long table in the center of the hall, a table black as ebony, and gleaming with wrought silver and gold.
<p/>In the center of it was a huge carven bowl, with the glistening gleam of ferns and the red and purple of rare orchids, glowing from a light hidden somewhere in their midst.
<p/>'' '' This's the dinin' room,'' observed Master Freddie. '' How you like it, hey, ole sport? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) always insisted on having an answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) remarks, leaning over Jurgis and smiling into his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) face.
<p/>Jurgis liked it. '' Rummy ole place to feed in all `lone, though,'' was Freddie's comment--<div class="bookquote">``rummy's hell! Whuzya think, hey?''  (<font color='red'><b>Freddie/Master Freddie</b></font>)</div>Then another idea occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) went on, without waiting:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Maybe you never saw anythin--hic--like this `fore? Hey, ole chappie?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No,'' said Jurgis. '' Come from country, maybe--hey?'' '' Yes,'' said Jurgis.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Aha! I thosso! Lossa folks from country never saw such a place. Guv`ner brings 'em--free show--hic--reg`lar circus! Go home tell folks about it.
<p/>Ole man Jones's place--Jones the packer--beef-trust man. Made it all out of hogs, too, damn ole scoundrel. Now we see where our pennies go--rebates, an' private car lines--hic--by Harry!
<p/>Bully place, though--worth seein'! Ever hear of Jones the packer, hey, ole chappie?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis had started involuntarily; the other, whose sharp eyes missed nothing, demanded: <div class="bookquote">``Whuzzamatter, hey?
<p/>Heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>And Jurgis managed to stammer out: <div class="bookquote">``I have worked for him (<font color='blue'><b>Heard</b></font>) in the yards.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>cried Master Freddie, with a yell.
<p/>'' You! In the yards? Ho, ho! Why, say, thass good! Shake hands on it, ole man--by Harry! Guv`ner ought to be here--glad to see you.
<p/>Great fren's with the men, guv`ner--labor an' capital, commun'ty 'f int`rests, an' all that--hic! Funny things happen in this world, don't they, ole man?
<p/>Hamilton, lemme interduce you--fren' the family--ole fren' the guv`ner's--works in the yards. Come to spend the night wiz me, Hamilton--have a hot time.
<p/>The stately butler bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) head, but made not a sound; and suddenly Master Freddie pointed an eager finger at him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>).
<p/>Me fren', Mr.--whuzya name, ole chappie? Tell us your name.'' <div class="bookquote">``Rudkus--Jurgis Rudkus.''  (<font color='red'><b>fren</b></font>)</div>'' My fren', Mr. Rednose, Hamilton--shake han's. '' ''
<p/>I know whuzzamatter wiz you, Hamilton--lay you a dollar I know! You think--hic--you think I'm drunk! Hey, now?'' And the butler again bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' Yes, sir,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) said, at which Master Freddie hung tightly upon Jurgis's neck and went into a fit of laughter.
<p/>'' Hamilton, you damn ole scoundrel,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) roared, <div class="bookquote">``I'll `scharge you for impudence, you see 'f I don't! Ho, ho, ho!
<p/>I'm drunk! Ho, ho! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The two waited until his (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) fit had spent itself, to see what new whim would seize him (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>).
<p/>'' Whatcha wanta do? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Ho</b></font>) queried suddenly. '' Wanta see the place, ole chappie? Wamme play the guv`ner--show you roun'?
<p/>State parlors-- Looee Cans-- Looee Sez--chairs cost three thousand apiece. Tea room Maryanntnet--picture of shepherds dancing--Ruysdael--twenty-three thousan'! Ballroom--balc`ny pillars--hic--imported--special ship--sixty-eight thousan'!

<p/>No--never mind--clean forgot--says he (<font color='blue'><b>Rednose</b></font>)'s hungry, Hamilton--less have some supper. Only--hic--don't less have it here--come up to my place, ole sport--nice an' cosy.
<p/>This way--steady now, don't slip on the floor. Hamilton, we'll have a cole spread, an' some fizz--don't leave out the fizz, by Harry.
<p/>We'll have some of the eighteen-thirty Madeira. Hear me, sir?'' '' Yes, sir,'' said the butler, <div class="bookquote">``but, Master Frederick, your father left orders--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler Frederick Frederick</b></font>)</div>And Master Frederick drew himself up to a stately height. '' My father's orders were left to me--hic--an' not to you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said.
<p/>Then, clasping Jurgis tightly by the neck, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) staggered out of the room; on the way another idea occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">``Any--hic--cable message for me, Hamilton?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, sir,'' said the butler. '' Guv`ner must be travelin'. An' how's the twins, Hamilton?'' '' They are doing well, sir.''
<p/>They went up the great staircase, one step at a time; at the top of it there gleamed at them out of the shadows the figure of a nymph crouching by a fountain, a figure ravishingly beautiful, the flesh warm and glowing with the hues of life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good!''  (<font color='red'><b>Master</b></font>)</div>said Master Freddie; and added fervently: <div class="bookquote">``God bless 'em, the little lambs! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Master Freddie</b></font>)</div>Above was a huge court, with domed roof, the various apartments opening into it.
<p/>The butler had paused below but a few minutes to give orders, and then followed them; now he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) pressed a button, and the hall blazed with light.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) opened a door before them, and then pressed another button, as they staggered into the apartment. It was fitted up as a study.
<p/>In the center was a mahogany table, covered with books, and smokers' implements; the walls were decorated with college trophies and colors--flags, posters, photographs and knickknacks--tennis rackets, canoe paddles, golf clubs, and polo sticks.
<p/>An enormous moose head, with horns six feet across, faced a buffalo head on the opposite wall, while bear and tiger skins covered the polished floor.
<p/>There were lounging chairs and sofas, window seats covered with soft cushions of fantastic designs; there was one corner fitted in Persian fashion, with a huge canopy and a jeweled lamp beneath.
<p/>Beyond, a door opened upon a bedroom, and beyond that was a swimming pool of the purest marble, that had cost about forty thousand dollars.
<p/>Master Freddie stood for a moment or two, gazing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>); then out of the next room a dog emerged, a monstrous bulldog, the most hideous object that Jurgis had ever laid eyes upon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) yawned, opening a mouth like a dragon's; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) came toward the young man, wagging his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) tail. '' Hello, Dewey!'' cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewey</b></font>) master.
<p/>'' Been havin' a snooze, ole boy? Well, well--hello there, whuzzamatter? '' -LRB-The dog was snarling at Jurgis.-RRB- '' Why, Dewey--this' my fren', Mr. Rednose--ole fren' the guv`ner's!
<p/>Mr. Rednose, Admiral Dewey; shake han's--hic. Ain't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewey</b></font>) a daisy, though--blue ribbon at the New York show--eighty-five hundred at a clip!
<p/>The speaker sank into one of the big armchairs, and Admiral Dewey crouched beneath it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewey</b></font>) did not snarl again, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dewey</b></font>) never took his (<font color='blue'><b>Dewey</b></font>) eyes off Jurgis.
<p/>How's that , hey? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dewey</b></font>) was perfectly sober, was the Admiral. The butler had closed the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) stood by it, watching Jurgis every second.
<p/>Now there came footsteps outside, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) opened the door a man in livery entered, carrying a folding table, and behind him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) two men with covered trays.
<p/>There were cold pates, and thin slices of meat, tiny bread and butter sandwiches with the crust cut off, a bowl of sliced peaches and cream -LRB-in January-RRB-, little fancy cakes, pink and green and yellow and white, and half a dozen ice-cold bottles of wine.
<p/>They stood like statues while the first spread the table and set out the contents of the trays upon it. ''
<p/>Thass the stuff for you!'' cried Master Freddie, exultantly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) spied them. '' Come `long, ole chappie, move up. ''
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) seated himself at the table; the waiter pulled a cork, and he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) took the bottle and poured three glasses of its contents in succession down his (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) throat.
<p/>The butler held the chair at the opposite side of the table, and Jurgis thought it was to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) out of it; but finally he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) understand that it was the other's intention to put it under him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>), and so he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) sat down, cautiously and mistrustingly.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) gave a long-drawn sigh, and cried again to Jurgis to seat himself. Master Freddie perceived that the attendants embarrassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) remarked with a nod to them, <div class="bookquote">``You may go.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They went, all save the butler. '' You may go too, Hamilton,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) said. '' Master Frederick--'' the man began.
<p/>The man went out and closed the door; Jurgis, who was as sharp as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the key out of the lock, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might peer through the keyhole.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the youngster</b></font>)</div>cried the youngster, angrily. '' Damn you, don't you hear me? '' Master Frederick turned to the table again.
<p/>'' Now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``go for it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Jurgis gazed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) doubtingly. <div class="bookquote">``Eat! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried the other. '' Pile in, ole chappie!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't you want anything?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis asked. '' Ain't hungry,'' was the reply--<div class="bookquote">``only thirsty. Kitty and me had some candy--you go on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) ate as with two shovels, his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) fork in one hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) knife in the other; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) once got started his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) wolf-hunger got the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) did not stop for breath until he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) had cleared every plate.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>So Jurgis began, without further parley. '' Gee whiz! '' said the other, who had been watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) in wonder.
<p/>Lessee you drink now,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) said; and Jurgis took the bottle and turned it up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) mouth, and a wonderfully unearthly liquid ecstasy poured down his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) throat, tickling every nerve of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>), thrilling him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) with joy.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) held Jurgis the bottle. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) drank the very last drop of it, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) gave vent to a long-drawn <div class="bookquote">``Ah!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Freddie, sympathetically; he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) had leaned back in the big chair, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) arm behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) head and gazing at Jurgis.
<p/>'' ``Good stuff, hey? And Jurgis gazed back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was clad in spotless evening dress, was Freddie, and looked very handsome
<p/>--he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) was a beautiful boy, with light golden hair and the head of an Antinous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) smiled at Jurgis confidingly, and then started talking again, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) blissful insouciance.
<p/>This time he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) talked for ten minutes at a stretch, and in the course of the speech he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) told Jurgis all of his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) family history.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) big brother Charlie was in love with the guileless maiden who played the part of <div class="bookquote">``Little Bright-Eyes''  (<font color='red'><b>the maiden</b></font>)</div>in ``The Kaliph of Kamskatka.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had been on the verge of marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) once, only <div class="bookquote">``the guv`ner''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>had sworn to disinherit him (<font color='blue'><b>guv</b></font>), and had presented him (<font color='blue'><b>guv</b></font>) with a sum that would stagger the imagination, and that had staggered the virtue of <div class="bookquote">``Little Bright-Eyes.
<p/>Now Charlie had got leave from college, and had gone away in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) automobile on the next best thing to a honeymoon.
<p/>The guv`ner''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>had made threats to disinherit another of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) children also, sister Gwendolen, who had married an Italian marquis with a string of titles and a dueling record.
<p/>They lived in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) chateau, or rather had, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Charlie</b></font>) had taken to firing the breakfast dishes at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had cabled for help, and the old gentleman had gone over to find out what were his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) Grace's terms.
<p/>'' '' '' So they had left Freddie all alone, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) with less than two thousand dollars in his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>Freddie was up in arms and meant serious business, as they would find in the end--if there was no other way of bringing them to terms he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) would have his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Kittens''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>wire that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) was about to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>), and see what happened then.
<p/>So the cheerful youngster rattled on, until he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) was tired out. He (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) smiled his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) sweetest smile at Jurgis, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) eyes, sleepily.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) opened them again, and smiled once more, and finally closed them and forgot to open them. For several minutes Jurgis sat perfectly motionless, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>), and reveling in the strange sensation of the champagne.
<p/>Once he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) stirred, and the dog growled; after that he (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) sat almost holding his (<font color='blue'><b>youngster</b></font>) breath--until after a while the door of the room opened softly, and the butler came in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) walked toward Jurgis upon tiptoe, scowling at him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>); and Jurgis rose up, and retreated, scowling back. So until he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) was against the wall, and then the butler came close, and pointed toward the door.
<p/>If you do, you son of a--'' hissed the butler, <div class="bookquote">``I'll mash in your face for you before you get out of here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out of here!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) whispered. Jurgis hesitated, giving a glance at Freddie, who was snoring softly. '' And Jurgis wavered but an instant more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) saw <div class="bookquote">``Admiral Dewey''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>coming up behind the man and growling softly, to back up his (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) threats. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) surrendered and started toward the door.
<p/>They went out without a sound, and down the great echoing staircase, and through the dark hall. At the front door he (<font color='blue'><b>Freddie</b></font>) paused, and the butler strode close to him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>).
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) cried; and then understanding that the fellow proposed to search him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I'll see you in hell first.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Hold up your hands,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) snarled. Jurgis took a step back, clinching his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) one well fist. '' What for? <div class="bookquote">``Do you want to go to jail?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>demanded the butler, menacingly. '' I'll have the police-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Have 'em! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the police</b></font>)</div>roared Jurgis, with fierce passion. '' But you won't put your hands on me till you do!
<p/>I haven't touched anything in your damned house, and I'll not have you touch me!'' So the butler, who was terrified lest his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) young master should waken, stepped suddenly to the door, and opened it.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) said; and then as Jurgis passed through the opening, he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) a ferocious kick that sent him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) down the great stone steps at a run, and landed him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) sprawling in the snow at the bottom.
<p/>Chapter 25 Jurgis got up, wild with rage, but the door was shut and the great castle was dark and impregnable.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get out of here!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Then the icy teeth of the blast bit into him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) turned and went away at a run.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) stopped again it was because he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) was coming to frequented streets and did not wish to attract attention. In spite of that last humiliation, his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) heart was thumping fast with triumph.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) hand into his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) trousers' pocket every now and then, to make sure that the precious hundred-dollar bill was still there.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) had come out ahead on that deal! Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) was in a plight--a curious and even dreadful plight, when he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) came to realize it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) had not a single cent but that one bill! And he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) had to find some shelter that night he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) had to change it!
<p/>Jurgis spent half an hour walking and debating the problem. There was no one he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) could go to for help--he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) had to manage it all alone.
<p/>To get it changed in a lodging-house would be to take his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) life in his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) hands--he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) would almost certainly be robbed, and perhaps murdered, before morning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) might go to some hotel or railroad depot and ask to have it changed; but what would they think, seeing a <div class="bookquote">``bum''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>like him (<font color='blue'><b>bum</b></font>) with a hundred dollars?
<p/>On the morrow Freddie Jones would discover his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) loss, and there would be a hunt for him (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) would lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) money.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) would probably be arrested if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) tried it; and what story could he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) tell? The only other plan he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) could think of was to try in a saloon.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) began peering into places as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) walked; he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) passed several as being too crowded--then finally, chancing upon one where the bartender was all alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) gripped his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) hands in sudden resolution and went in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) might pay them to change it, if it could not be done otherwise. '' Can you change me a hundred-dollar bill?
<p/>The bartender was a big, husky fellow, with the jaw of a prize fighter, and a three weeks' stubble of hair upon it.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) demanded. He (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) stared at Jurgis. '' What's that youse say? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) demanded. '' I said, could you change me a hundred-dollar bill?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Where'd youse get it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) inquired incredulously. '' Never mind,'' said Jurgis; <div class="bookquote">``I've got it, and I want it changed.
<p/>I'll pay you if you'll do it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>The other stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>fighter</b></font>) hard. '' Lemme see it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Lem</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>Will you change it?'' Jurgis demanded, gripping it tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lem</b></font>) pocket. '' How the hell can I know if it's good or not?
<p/>Then Jurgis slowly and warily approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Lem</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Lem</b></font>) took out the bill, and fumbled it for a moment, while the man stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with hostile eyes across the counter.
<p/>The other took it, and began to examine it; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) smoothed it between his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers, and held it up to the light; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned it over, and upside down, and edgeways.
<p/>'' retorted the bartender. '' Whatcher take me for, hey? '' Then finally he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) handed it over. It was new and rather stiff, and that made him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) dubious.
<p/>Humph,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) said, finally, and gazed at the stranger, sizing him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) up--a ragged, ill-smelling tramp, with no overcoat and one arm in a sling--and a hundred-dollar bill! ''
<p/>Jurgis was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) like a cat all the time. '' Want to buy anything? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) demanded. '' Yes,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``I'll take a glass of beer.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) put the bill in his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) pocket, and poured Jurgis out a glass of beer, and set it on the counter.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) turned to the cash register, and punched up five cents, and began to pull money out of the drawer.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>'' All right,'' said the other, <div class="bookquote">``I'll change it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) faced Jurgis, counting it out--two dimes, a quarter, and fifty cents.
<p/>'' There,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) said. For a second Jurgis waited, expecting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) turn again. '' My ninety-nine dollars,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' What ninety-nine dollars?'' demanded the bartender. '' My change! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) cried--<div class="bookquote">``the rest of my hundred!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on,''  (<font color='red'><b>the bartender</b></font>)</div>said the bartender, <div class="bookquote">``you're nutty!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bartender</b></font>)</div><p/>For an instant horror reigned in him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>)--black, paralyzing, awful horror, clutching him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) at the heart; and then came rage, in surging, blinding floods--he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) screamed aloud, and seized the glass and hurled it at the other's head.
<p/>The man ducked, and it missed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by half an inch; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rose again and faced Jurgis, who was vaulting over the bar with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) one well arm, and dealt him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a smashing blow in the face, hurling him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) backward upon the floor.
<p/>Then, as Jurgis scrambled to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feet again and started round the counter after him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``Help! help!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Jurgis seized a bottle off the counter as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ran; and as the bartender made a leap he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hurled the missile at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) force.
<p/>And Jurgis stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with wild eyes. It just grazed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and shivered into a thousand pieces against the post of the door.
<p/>This time, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) blind frenzy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came without a bottle, and that was all the bartender wanted--he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) met him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) halfway and floored him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) with a sledgehammer drive between the eyes.
<p/>An instant later the screen doors flew open, and two men rushed in--just as Jurgis was getting to his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) feet again, foaming at the mouth with rage, and trying to tear his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) broken arm out of its bandages.
<p/>Then Jurgis started back, rushing at the man again in the middle of the room. <div class="bookquote">``Look out!''  (<font color='red'><b>the bartender</b></font>)</div>shouted the bartender. ''
<p/>Then, seeing that the two were disposed to join the fray, he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) made another rush at Jurgis, and knocked aside his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) feeble defense and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) tumbling again; and the three flung themselves upon him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>), rolling and kicking about the place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>)'s got a knife!'' A second later a policeman dashed in, and the bartender yelled once more--<div class="bookquote">``Look out for his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) knife!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the bartender</b></font>)</div><p/>Jurgis had fought himself half to his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) knees, when the policeman made a leap at him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>), and cracked him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) across the face with his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) club.
<p/>Though the blow staggered him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>), the wild-beast frenzy still blazed in him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) got to his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) feet, lunging into the air.
<p/>The policeman crouched over him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>), clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) stick, waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) to try to rise again; and meantime the barkeeper got up, and put his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) head.
<p/>Then again the club descended, full upon his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) head, and he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) dropped like a log to the floor. '' Christ! ''
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I thought I was done for that time. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) cut me?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't see anything, Jake,''  (<font color='red'><b>the policeman</b></font>)</div>said the policeman.
<p/>'' What's the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Just crazy drunk,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other. '' A lame duck, too--but he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) `most got me under the bar.
<p/>Youse had better call the wagon, Billy.'' '' No,'' said the officer. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)'s got no more fight in him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), I guess--and he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)'s only got a block to go.
<p/>But Jurgis did not move, and the bartender went behind the bar, and after stowing the hundred-dollar bill away in a safe hiding place, came and poured a glass of water over Jurgis.
<p/>Then, as the latter began to moan feebly, the policeman got him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) feet and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) out of the place.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) hand in Jurgis's collar and jerked at him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>). '' Git up here, you!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) commanded. The station house was just around the corner, and so in a few minutes Jurgis was in a cell.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) spent half the night lying unconscious, and the balance moaning in torment, with a blinding headache and a racking thirst.
<p/>There were others in that same station house with split heads and a fever; there were hundreds of them in the great city, and tens of thousands of them in the great land, and there was no one to hear any of them.
<p/>In the morning Jurgis was given a cup of water and a piece of bread, and then hustled into a patrol wagon and driven to the nearest police court.
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) cried aloud for a drink of water, but there was no one to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) sat in the pen with a score of others until his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) turn came.
<p/>The prisoner had come into his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) saloon after midnight, fighting drunk, and had ordered a glass of beer and tendered a dollar bill in payment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) had been given ninety-five cents' change, and had demanded ninety-nine dollars more, and before the plaintiff could even answer had hurled the glass at him (<font color='blue'><b>plaintiff</b></font>) and then attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>plaintiff</b></font>) with a bottle of bitters, and nearly wrecked the place.
<p/>Then the prisoner was sworn--a forlorn object, haggard and unshorn, with an arm done up in a filthy bandage, a cheek and head cut, and bloody, and one eye purplish black and entirely closed.
<p/>The bartender--who proved to be a well-known bruiser--was called to the stand. He (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) took the oath and told his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) story. ''
<p/>Your Honor,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``I went into his (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) place and asked the man if he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) could change me a hundred-dollar bill.
<p/>What have you to say for yourself?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>queried the magistrate. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) would if I bought a drink.
<p/>I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) the bill and then he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) wouldn't give me the change. '' The magistrate was staring at him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) in perplexity.
<p/>'' You gave him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) a hundred-dollar bill!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Yes, your Honor,'' said Jurgis. '' Where did you get it?''
<p/>'' A man gave it to me, your Honor. '' <div class="bookquote">``A man? What man, and what for?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A young man I met upon the street, your Honor.
<p/>There was a titter in the courtroom; the officer who was holding Jurgis put up his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) hand to hide a smile, and the magistrate smiled without trying to hide it.
<p/>I had been begging. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It's true, your Honor!'' cried Jurgis, passionately. '' You had been drinking as well as begging last night, had you not?
<p/>'' inquired the magistrate. '' No, your Honor--'' protested Jurgis. <div class="bookquote">``I--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' You had not had anything to drink?'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, yes, your Honor, I had--''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' What did you have?'' <div class="bookquote">``I had a bottle of something--I don't know what it was--something that burned-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>the magistrate</b></font>)</div>There was again a laugh round the courtroom, stopping suddenly as the magistrate looked up and frowned.
<p/>'' Have you ever been arrested before? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) asked abruptly. The question took Jurgis aback. '' I-- I--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) stammered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me the truth, now!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>commanded the other, sternly. '' Yes, your Honor,'' said Jurgis. '' How often?'' '' Only once, your Honor.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What for?''  (<font color='red'><b>boss</b></font>)</div>'' For knocking down my boss, your Honor. I was working in the stockyards, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>)-- '' <div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) Honor;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I guess that will do. You ought to stop drinking if you can't control yourself. Ten days and costs. Next case.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Jurgis gave vent to a cry of dismay, cut off suddenly by the policeman, who seized him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) by the collar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was jerked out of the way, into a room with the convicted prisoners, where he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) sat and wept like a child in his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) impotent rage.
<p/>It seemed monstrous to him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) that policemen and judges should esteem his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) word as nothing in comparison with the bartender's--poor Jurgis could not know that the owner of the saloon paid five dollars each week to the policeman alone for Sunday privileges and general favors--nor that the pugilist bartender was one of the most trusted henchmen of the Democratic leader of the district, and had helped only a few months before to hustle out a record-breaking vote as a testimonial to the magistrate, who had been made the target of odious kid-gloved reformers.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) tumbling around he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) arm again, and so could not work, but had to be attended by the physician.
<p/>Jurgis was driven out to the Bridewell for the second time. Also his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) head and his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) eye had to be tied up--and so he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) was a pretty-looking object
<p/>when, the second day after his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) went out into the exercise court and encountered--Jack Duane! The young fellow was so glad to see Jurgis that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) almost hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>'' By God, if it isn't `the Stinker'!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried. '' And what is it--have you been through a sausage machine?''
<p/>And then, while some of the other prisoners gathered round he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wild story; most of them were incredulous, but Duane knew that Jurgis could never have made up such a yarn as that.
<p/>'' No,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``but I've been in a railroad wreck and a fight. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>'' Hard luck, old man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, when they were alone; <div class="bookquote">``but maybe it's taught you a lesson.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've learned some things since I saw you last,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>said Jurgis mournfully. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) explained how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spent the last summer, <div class="bookquote">``hoboing it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>as the phrase was.
<p/>'' And you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked finally. '' Have you been here ever since?'' <div class="bookquote">``Lord, no! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the other. ''
<p/>I only came in the day before yesterday. It's the second time they've sent me up on a trumped-up charge-- I've had hard luck and can't pay them what they want.
<p/>Why don't you quit Chicago with me, Jurgis?'' '' I've no place to go,'' said Jurgis, sadly. '' Neither have I,'' replied the other, laughing lightly.
<p/>In the Bridewell Jurgis met few who had been there the last time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) met scores of others, old and young, of exactly the same sort.
<p/>'' But we'll wait till we get out and see. '' It was like breakers upon a beach; there was new water, but the wave looked just the same.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) strolled about and talked with them, and the biggest of them told tales of their prowess, while those who were weaker, or younger and inexperienced, gathered round and listened in admiring silence.
<p/>The last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was there, Jurgis had thought of little but his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) family; but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was free to listen to these men, and to realize that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was one of them--that their point of view was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) point of view, and that the way they kept themselves alive in the world was the way he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) meant to do it in the future.
<p/>And so, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) was turned out of prison again, without a penny in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) pocket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) went straight to Jack Duane.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) went full of humility and gratitude; for Duane was a gentleman, and a man with a profession--and it was remarkable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) should be willing to throw in his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) lot with a humble workingman, one who had even been a beggar and a tramp.
<p/>Jurgis could not see what help he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) could be to him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) did not understand that a man like himself--who could be trusted to stand by any one who was kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--was as rare among criminals as among any other class of men.
<p/>The address Jurgis had was a garret room in the Ghetto district, the home of a pretty little French girl, Duane's mistress, who sewed all day, and eked out her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) living by prostitution.
<p/>The new address was a cellar dive, whose proprietor said that he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) had never heard of Duane; but after he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had put Jurgis through a catechism he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) a back stairs which led to a <div class="bookquote">``fence''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>in the rear of a pawnbroker's shop, and thence to a number of assignation rooms, in one of which Duane was hiding.
<p/>Duane was glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was without a cent of money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) said, and had been waiting for Jurgis to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) get some.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) explained his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) plan--in fact he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) spent the day in laying bare to his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) friend the criminal world of the city, and in showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) might earn himself a living in it.
<p/>That winter he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) would have a hard time, on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) arm, and because of an unwonted fit of activity of the police; but so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was unknown to them he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) would be safe if he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) were careful.
<p/>Here at <div class="bookquote">``Papa''  (<font color='red'><b>Hanson</b></font>)</div>Hanson's -LRB-so they called the old man who kept the dive-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might rest at ease, for <div class="bookquote">``Papa''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Hanson was <div class="bookquote">``square'' (<font color='red'><b>Hanson</b></font>)</div>--would stand by him (<font color='blue'><b>Hanson</b></font>) so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hanson</b></font>) paid, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hanson</b></font>) an hour's notice if there were to be a police raid.
<p/>Also Rosensteg, the pawnbroker, would buy anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Hanson</b></font>) had for a third of its value, and guarantee to keep it hidden for a year.
<p/>There was an oil stove in the little cupboard of a room, and they had some supper; and then about eleven o'clock at night they sallied forth together, by a rear entrance to the place, Duane armed with a slingshot.
<p/>They came to a residence district, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) sprang up a lamppost and blew out the light, and then the two dodged into the shelter of an area step and hid in silence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had gone elsewhere, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) told Jurgis--he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was afraid to stay there now, on account of the police. Pretty soon a man came by, a workingman--and they let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) go.
<p/>Then after a long interval came the heavy tread of a policeman, and they held their breath till he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) was gone.
<p/>Though half-frozen, they waited a full quarter of an hour after that--and then again came footsteps, walking briskly. Duane nudged Jurgis, and the instant the man had passed they rose up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was only a couple of feet behind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) leaped to stop the man's mouth, while Duane held him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) fast by the arms, as they had agreed.
<p/>But the man was limp and showed a tendency to fall, and so Jurgis had only to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the collar, while the other, with swift fingers, went through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets--ripping open, first his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) overcoat, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat, and then his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vest, searching inside and outside, and transferring the contents into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own pockets.
<p/>Duane stole out as silently as a shadow, and a second later Jurgis heard a thud and a stifled cry. At last, after feeling of the man's fingers and in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) necktie, Duane whispered, <div class="bookquote">``That's all!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Duane/Jack Duane/Jack</b></font>)</div><p/>and they dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) to the area and dropped him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) in. Then Jurgis went one way and his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) friend the other, walking briskly.
<p/>There was a gold watch, for one thing, with a chain and locket; there was a silver pencil, and a matchbox, and a handful of small change, and finally a card-case.
<p/>This last Duane opened feverishly--there were letters and checks, and two theater-tickets, and at last, in the back part, a wad of bills.
<p/>The latter arrived first, and Jurgis found him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) examining the <div class="bookquote">``swag. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) counted them--there was a twenty, five tens, four fives, and three ones.
<p/>After further examination, they burned the card-case and its contents, all but the bills, and likewise the picture of a little girl in the locket.
<p/>Duane drew a long breath. '' That lets us out! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) said. Then Duane took the watch and trinkets downstairs, and came back with sixteen dollars.
<p/>'' The old scoundrel said the case was filled,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) said. '' It's a lie, but he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) knows I want the money.
<p/>'' They divided up the spoils, and Jurgis got as his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) share fifty-five dollars and some change. He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) protested that it was too much, but the other had agreed to divide even.
<p/>When they got up in the morning, Jurgis was sent out to buy a paper; one of the pleasures of committing a crime was the reading about it afterward.
<p/>I had a pal that always did it,'' Duane remarked, laughing--<div class="bookquote">``until one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) read that he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had left three thousand dollars in a lower inside pocket of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) party's vest!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Duane/Jack Duane/Jack</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a half-column account of the robbery--it was evident that a gang was operating in the neighborhood, said the paper, for it was the third within a week, and the police were apparently powerless.
<p/>The victim was an insurance agent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had lost a hundred and ten dollars that did not belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>).
<p/>That was a good haul, he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) said, better than average. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had chanced to have his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) name marked on his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) shirt, otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) would not have been identified yet.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) assailant had hit him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) too hard, and he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) was suffering from concussion of the brain; and also he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) had been half-frozen when found, and would lose three fingers on his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) right hand.
<p/>Since it was Jurgis's first experience, these details naturally caused him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) some worriment; but the other laughed coolly--it was the way of the game, and there was no helping it.
<p/>The enterprising newspaper reporter had taken all this information to his (<font color='blue'><b>reporter</b></font>) family, and told how they had received it. Before long Jurgis would think no more of it than they did in the yards of knocking out a bullock.
<p/>'' It's a case of us or the other fellow, and I say the other fellow, every time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) observed. ''
<p/>Still,'' said Jurgis, reflectively, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) never did us any harm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was doing it to somebody as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could, you can be sure of that,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) friend.
<p/>Duane had already explained to Jurgis that if a man of their trade were known he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) would have to work all the time to satisfy the demands of the police.
<p/>Therefore it would be better for Jurgis to stay in hiding and never be seen in public with his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) pal. But Jurgis soon got very tired of staying in hiding.
<p/>In a couple of weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was feeling strong and beginning to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) arm, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) could not stand it any longer.
<p/>Duane, who had done a job of some sort by himself, and made a truce with the powers, brought over Marie, his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) little French girl, to share with him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>); but even that did not avail for long, and in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had to give up arguing, and take Jurgis out and introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) to the saloons and <div class="bookquote">``sporting houses''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>where the big crooks and <div class="bookquote">``holdup men''  (<font color='red'><b>the crooks men</b></font>)</div>hung out.
<p/>The city, which was owned by an oligarchy of business men, being nominally ruled by the people, a huge army of graft was necessary for the purpose of effecting the transfer of power.
<p/>Twice a year, in the spring and fall elections, millions of dollars were furnished by the business men and expended by this army; meetings were held and clever speakers were hired, bands played and rockets sizzled, tons of documents and reservoirs of drinks were distributed, and tens of thousands of votes were bought for cash.
<p/>And so Jurgis got a glimpse of the high-class criminal world of Chicago. And this army of graft had, of course, to be maintained the year round.
<p/>The leaders and organizers were maintained by the business men directly--aldermen and legislators by means of bribes, party officials out of the campaign funds, lobbyists and corporation lawyers in the form of salaries, contractors by means of jobs, labor union leaders by subsidies, and newspaper proprietors and editors by advertisements.
<p/>There was the police department, and the fire and water departments, and the whole balance of the civil list, from the meanest office boy to the head of a city department; and for the horde who could find no room in these, there was the world of vice and crime, there was license to seduce, to swindle and plunder and prey.
<p/>The law forbade Sunday drinking; and this had delivered the saloon-keepers into the hands of the police, and made an alliance between them necessary.
<p/>The rank and file, however, were either foisted upon the city, or else lived off the population directly. The law forbade prostitution; and this had brought the <div class="bookquote">``madames''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>into the combination.
<p/>It was the same with the gambling-house keeper and the poolroom man, and the same with any other man or woman who had a means of getting <div class="bookquote">``graft,''  (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div>and was willing to pay over a share of it: the green-goods man and the highwayman, the pickpocket and the sneak thief, and the receiver of stolen goods, the seller of adulterated milk, of stale fruit and diseased meat, the proprietor of unsanitary tenements, the fake doctor and the usurer, the beggar and the <div class="bookquote">``pushcart man,''  (<font color='red'><b>the beggar</b></font>)</div>the prize fighter and the professional slugger, the race-track <div class="bookquote">``tout,''  (<font color='red'><b>the slugger</b></font>)</div>the procurer, the white-slave agent, and the expert seducer of young girls.
<p/>All of these agencies of corruption were banded together, and leagued in blood brotherhood with the politician and the police; more often than not they were one and the same person,--the police captain would own the brothel he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) pretended to raid, the politician would open his (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) headquarters in his (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) saloon.
<p/>Hinkydink'' or <div class="bookquote">``Bathhouse John,''  (<font color='red'><b>others</b></font>)</div>or others of that ilk, were proprietors of the most notorious dives in Chicago, and also the <div class="bookquote">``gray wolves''  (<font color='red'><b>Hinkydink proprietors wolves gamblers burglars</b></font>)</div>of the city council, who gave away the streets of the city to the business men; and those who patronized their places were the gamblers and prize fighters who set the law at defiance, and the burglars and holdup men who kept the whole city in terror.
<p/>On election day all these powers of vice and crime were one power; they could tell within one per cent what the vote of their district would be, and they could change it at an hour's notice.
<p/>A month ago Jurgis had all but perished of starvation upon the streets; and now suddenly, as by the gift of a magic key, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had entered into a world where money and all the good things of life came freely.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was introduced by his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) friend to an Irishman named <div class="bookquote">``Buck''  (<font color='red'><b>an Irishman</b></font>)</div>Halloran, who was a political <div class="bookquote">``worker''  (<font color='red'><b>Halloran</b></font>)</div>and on the inside of things.
<p/>This man talked with Jurgis for a while, and then told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a little plan by which a man who looked like a workingman might make some easy money; but it was a private affair, and had to be kept quiet.
<p/>Jurgis expressed himself as agreeable, and the other took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that afternoon -LRB-it was Saturday-RRB- to a place where city laborers were being paid off.
<p/>Jurgis went, according to directions, and gave the name of <div class="bookquote">``Michael O'Flaherty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>and received an envelope, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Michael</b></font>) took around the corner and delivered to Halloran, who was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) in a saloon.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) went again; and gave the name of <div class="bookquote">``Johann Schmidt,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and a third time, and give the name of <div class="bookquote">``Serge Reminitsky.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The paymaster sat in a little booth, with a pile of envelopes before him (<font color='blue'><b>Serge</b></font>), and two policemen standing by. ''
<p/>For this work he (<font color='blue'><b>Serge</b></font>) received five dollars, and was told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Serge</b></font>) might have it every week, so long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Serge</b></font>) kept quiet.
<p/>As Jurgis was excellent at keeping quiet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Serge</b></font>) soon won the trust of <div class="bookquote">``Buck''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Halloran, and was introduced to others as a man who could be depended upon.
<p/>This acquaintance was useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in another way, also before long Jurgis made his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) discovery of the meaning of <div class="bookquote">``pull,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>and just why his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) boss, Connor, and also the pugilist bartender, had been able to send him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to jail.
<p/>One night there was given a ball, the <div class="bookquote">``benefit''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>of <div class="bookquote">``One-eyed Larry,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>a lame man who played the violin in one of the big <div class="bookquote">``high-class''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>houses of prostitution on Clark Street, and was a wag and a popular character on the ``Levee.
<p/>This ball was held in a big dance hall, and was one of the occasions when the city's powers of debauchery gave themselves up to madness.
<p/>Jurgis attended and got half insane with drink, and began quarreling over a girl; his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) arm was pretty strong by then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) set to work to clean out the place, and ended in a cell in the police station.
<p/>The police station being crowded to the doors, and stinking with <div class="bookquote">``bums,''  (<font color='red'><b>police</b></font>)</div>Jurgis did not relish staying there to sleep off his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) liquor, and sent for Halloran, who called up the district leader and had Jurgis bailed out by telephone at four o'clock in the morning.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) was arraigned that same morning, the district leader had already seen the clerk of the court and explained that Jurgis Rudkus was a decent fellow, who had been indiscreet; and so Jurgis was fined ten dollars and the fine was <div class="bookquote">``suspended'' (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>--which meant that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did not have to pay for it, and never would have to pay it, unless somebody chose to bring it up against him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in the future.
<p/>Among the people Jurgis lived with now money was valued according to an entirely different standard from that of the people of Packingtown; yet, strange as it may seem, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) did a great deal less drinking than he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had as a workingman.
<p/>Halloran had quite a list of imaginary workingmen, and Jurgis got an envelope for each one. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) had not the same provocations of exhaustion and hopelessness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) had now something to work for, to struggle for.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) soon found that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) wits about him (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) would come upon new opportunities; and being naturally an active man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not only kept sober himself, but helped to steady his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, who was a good deal fonder of both wine and women than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' Halloran he (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) was sitting late one night with Duane, when a <div class="bookquote">``country customer''  (<font color='red'><b>Duane/Jack Duane/Jack</b></font>)</div>-LRB-a buyer for an out-of-town merchant-RRB- came in, a little more than half ``piped.
<p/>There was no one else in the place but the bartender, and as the man went out again Jurgis and Duane followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) went round the corner, and in a dark place made by a combination of the elevated railroad and an unrented building, Jurgis leaped forward and shoved a revolver under his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) nose, while Duane, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) hat pulled over his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) eyes, went through the man's pockets with lightning fingers.
<p/>They got his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) watch and his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``wad,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and were round the corner again and into the saloon before he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) could shout more than once.
<p/>The bartender, to whom they had tipped the wink, had the cellar door open for them, and they vanished, making their way by a secret entrance to a brothel next door.
<p/>One thing led to another. In the saloon where Jurgis met <div class="bookquote">``Buck ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>From the roof of this there was access to three similar places beyond.
<p/>By means of these passages the customers of any one place could be gotten out of the way, in case a falling out with the police chanced to lead to a raid; and also it was necessary to have a way of getting a girl out of reach in case of an emergency.
<p/>Thousands of them came to Chicago answering advertisements for <div class="bookquote">``servants''  (<font color='red'><b>Thousands</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``factory hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thousands</b></font>)</div>and found themselves trapped by fake employment agencies, and locked up in a bawdy-house.
<p/>It was generally enough to take all their clothes away from them; but sometimes they would have to be <div class="bookquote">``doped''  (<font color='red'><b>prisoners</b></font>)</div>and kept prisoners for weeks; and meantime their parents might be telegraphing the police, and even coming on to see why nothing was done.
<p/>Occasionally there was no way of satisfying them but to let them search the place to which the girl had been traced.
<p/>For his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) help in this little job, the bartender received twenty out of the hundred and thirty odd dollars that the pair secured; and naturally this put them on friendly terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>), and a few days later he (<font color='blue'><b>bartender</b></font>) introduced them to a little <div class="bookquote">``sheeny''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>named Goldberger, one of the <div class="bookquote">``runners''  (<font color='red'><b>Goldberger</b></font>)</div>of the <div class="bookquote">``sporting house''  (<font color='red'><b>Goldberger</b></font>)</div>where they had been hidden.
<p/>After a few drinks Goldberger began, with some hesitation, to narrate how he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberger</b></font>) had had a quarrel over his (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberger</b></font>) best girl with a professional <div class="bookquote">``cardsharp,''  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>who had hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberger</b></font>) in the jaw.
<p/>The fellow was a stranger in Chicago, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was found some night with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head cracked there would be no one to care very much.
<p/>Jurgis, who by this time would cheerfully have cracked the heads of all the gamblers in Chicago, inquired what would be coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); at which the Jew became still more confidential, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had some tips on the New Orleans races, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) got direct from the police captain of the district, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had got out of a bad scrape, and who <div class="bookquote">``stood in''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>with a big syndicate of horse owners.
<p/>Duane took all this in at once, but Jurgis had to have the whole race-track situation explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) realized the importance of such an opportunity.
<p/>It owned the legislatures in every state in which it did business; it even owned some of the big newspapers, and made public opinion--there was no power in the land that could oppose it unless, perhaps, it were the Poolroom Trust.
<p/>It built magnificent racing parks all over the country, and by means of enormous purses it lured the people to come, and then it organized a gigantic shell game, whereby it plundered them of hundreds of millions of dollars every year.
<p/>Horse racing had once been a sport, but nowadays it was a business; a horse could be <div class="bookquote">``doped''  (<font color='red'><b>the spectators</b></font>)</div>and doctored, undertrained or overtrained; it could be made to fall at any moment--or its gait could be broken by lashing it with the whip, which all the spectators would take to be a desperate effort to keep it in the lead.
<p/>There was the gigantic Racing Trust. There were scores of such tricks; and sometimes it was the owners who played them and made fortunes
<p/>, sometimes it was the jockeys and trainers, sometimes it was outsiders, who bribed them--but most of the time it was the chiefs of the trust.
<p/>Now for instance, they were having winter racing in New Orleans and a syndicate was laying out each day's program in advance, and its agents in all the Northern cities were <div class="bookquote">``milking''  (<font color='red'><b>agents</b></font>)</div>the poolrooms.
<p/>The word came by long-distance telephone in a cipher code, just a little while before each race; and any man who could get the secret had as good as a fortune.
<p/>If Jurgis did not believe it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could try it, said the little Jew--let them meet at a certain house on the morrow and make a test.
<p/>Jurgis was willing, and so was Duane, and so they went to one of the high-class poolrooms where brokers and merchants gambled -LRB-with society women in a private room-RRB-, and they put up ten dollars each upon a horse called <div class="bookquote">``Black Beldame,''  (<font color='red'><b>society women</b></font>)</div>a six to one shot, and won.
<p/>For a secret like that they would have done a good many sluggings--but the next day Goldberger informed them that the offending gambler had got wind of what was coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberger</b></font>), and had skipped the town.
<p/>There were ups and downs at the business; but there was always a living, inside of a jail, if not out of it.
<p/>Jurgis, hanging round in dives and gambling houses and brothels, met with the heelers of both parties, and from their conversation he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberger</b></font>) came to understand all the ins and outs of the game, and to hear of a number of ways in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Goldberger</b></font>) could make himself useful about election time.
<p/>'' Halloran was a <div class="bookquote">``Democrat,''  (<font color='red'><b>Halloran</b></font>)</div>and so Jurgis became a Democrat also; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Democrat</b></font>) was not a bitter one--the Republicans were good fellows, too, and were to have a pile of money in this next campaign.
<p/>At the last election the Republicans had paid four dollars a vote to the Democrats' three; and <div class="bookquote">``Buck''  (<font color='red'><b>the Democrats</b></font>)</div>Halloran sat one night playing cards with Jurgis and another man, who told how Halloran had been charged with the job voting a <div class="bookquote">``bunch''  (<font color='red'><b>Halloran</b></font>)</div>of thirty-seven newly landed Italians, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>), the narrator, had met the Republican worker who was after the very same gang, and how the three had effected a bargain, whereby the Italians were to vote half and half, for a glass of beer apiece, while the balance of the fund went to the conspirators!
<p/>Not long after this, Jurgis, wearying of the risks and vicissitudes of miscellaneous crime, was moved to give up the career for that of a politician.
<p/>Early in April the city elections were due, and that meant prosperity for all the powers of graft. '' Buck Just at this time there was a tremendous uproar being raised concerning the alliance between the criminals and the police.
<p/>For the criminal graft was one in which the business men had no direct part--it was what is called a <div class="bookquote">``side line,''  (<font color='red'><b>the business men</b></font>)</div>carried by the police.
<p/>One night it chanced that while Jack Duane was drilling a safe in a clothing store he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) was caught red-handed by the night watchman, and turned over to a policeman, who chanced to know him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) well, and who took the responsibility of letting him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) make his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) escape.
<p/>Such a howl from the newspapers followed this that Duane was slated for sacrifice, and barely got out of town in time.
<p/>And just at that juncture it happened that Jurgis was introduced to a man named Harper whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) recognized as the night watchman at Brown's, who had been instrumental in making him (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) an American citizen, the first year of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) arrival at the yards.
<p/>The other was interested in the coincidence, but did not remember Jurgis--he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) had handled too many <div class="bookquote">``green ones''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Wide open'' gambling and debauchery made the city pleasing to <div class="bookquote">``trade,''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>but burglaries and holdups did not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brown</b></font>) sat in a dance hall with Jurgis and Halloran until one or two in the morning, exchanging experiences.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) had a long story to tell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) quarrel with the superintendent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) department, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>Halloran</b></font>) was now a plain workingman, and a good union man as well.
<p/>It was not until some months afterward that Jurgis understood that the quarrel with the superintendent had been prearranged, and that Harper was in reality drawing a salary of twenty dollars a week from the packers for an inside report of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) union's secret proceedings.
<p/>The people of Packingtown had borne about all that they would bear, and it looked as if a strike might begin any week.
<p/>After this talk the man made inquiries concerning Jurgis, and a couple of days later he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with an interesting proposition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not absolutely certain, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a regular salary if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would come to Packingtown and do as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was told, and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth shut.
<p/>Harper--<div class="bookquote">``Bush''  (<font color='red'><b>Harper</b></font>)</div>Harper, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) was called--was a right-hand man of Mike Scully, the Democratic boss of the stockyards; and in the coming election there was a peculiar situation.
<p/>There had come to Scully a proposition to nominate a certain rich brewer who lived upon a swell boulevard that skirted the district, and who coveted the big badge and the <div class="bookquote">``honorable''  (<font color='red'><b>a brewer</b></font>)</div>of an alderman.
<p/>The brewer was a Jew, and had no brains, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brewer</b></font>) was harmless, and would put up a rare campaign fund.
<p/>The yards were seething with agitation just then, said the man, speaking as a unionist. Scully had accepted the offer, and then gone to the Republicans with a proposition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was not sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) could manage the <div class="bookquote">``sheeny,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) did not mean to take any chances with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) district; let the Republicans nominate a certain obscure but amiable friend of Scully's, who was now setting tenpins in the cellar of an Ashland Avenue saloon, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>), Scully, would elect him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) with the <div class="bookquote">``sheeny's''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>money, and the Republicans might have the glory, which was more than they would get otherwise.
<p/>In return for this the Republicans would agree to put up no candidate the following year, when Scully himself came up for reelection as the other alderman from the ward.
<p/>To this the Republicans had assented at once; but the hell of it was--so Harper explained--that the Republicans were all of them fools--a man had to be a fool to be a Republican in the stockyards, where Scully was king.
<p/>And they didn't know how to work, and of course it would not do for the Democratic workers, the noble redskins of the War Whoop League, to support the Republican openly.
<p/>The difficulty would not have been so great except for another fact--there had been a curious development in stockyards politics in the last year or two, a new party having leaped into being.
<p/>The one image which the word <div class="bookquote">``Socialist''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>brought to Jurgis was of poor little Tamoszius Kuszleika, who had called himself one, and would go out with a couple of other men and a soap-box, and shout himself hoarse on a street corner Saturday nights.
<p/>Tamoszius had tried to explain to Jurgis what it was all about, but Jurgis, who was not of an imaginative turn, had never quite got it straight; at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) was content with his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) companion's explanation that the Socialists were the enemies of American institutions--could not be bought, and would not combine or make any sort of a ``dicker.
<p/>Mike Scully was very much worried over the opportunity which his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) last deal gave to them--the stockyards Democrats were furious at the idea of a rich capitalist for their candidate, and while they were changing they might possibly conclude that a Socialist firebrand was preferable to a Republican bum.
<p/>And so right here was a chance for Jurgis to make himself a place in the world, explained <div class="bookquote">``Bush''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Harper; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) had been a union man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) was known in the yards as a workingman; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) must have hundreds of acquaintances, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) had never talked politics with them he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) might come out as a Republican now without exciting the least suspicion.
<p/>There were barrels of money for the use of those who could deliver the goods; and Jurgis might count upon Mike Scully, who had never yet gone back on a friend.
<p/>They were the Socialists; and it was a devil of a mess, said <div class="bookquote">``Bush''  (<font color='red'><b>a devil Harper</b></font>)</div>Harper. '' Just what could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) do?
<p/>To begin with, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) would have to go to the yards and work, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) mightn't relish that; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) would have what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) earned, as well as the rest that came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) would get active in the union again, and perhaps try to get an office, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>), Harper, had; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) would tell all his (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) friends the good points of Doyle, the Republican nominee, and the bad ones of the <div class="bookquote">``sheeny'' (<font color='red'><b>the ones</b></font>)</div>; and then Scully would furnish a meeting place, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) would start the <div class="bookquote">``Young Men's Republican Association,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or something of that sort, and have the rich brewer's best beer by the hogshead, and fireworks and speeches, just like the War Whoop League.
<p/>Surely Jurgis must know hundreds of men who would like that sort of fun; and there would be the regular Republican leaders and workers to help him (<font color='blue'><b>Republican</b></font>) out, and they would deliver a big enough majority on election day.
<p/>Jurgis asked, in some perplexity, and the other explained in detail. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Republican</b></font>) had heard all this explanation to the end, Jurgis demanded:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But how can I get a job in Packingtown? I'm blacklisted. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>At which <div class="bookquote">``Bush''  (<font color='red'><b>Harper</b></font>)</div>Harper laughed. '' I'll attend to that all right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) said.
<p/>So Jurgis went out to the stockyards again, and was introduced to the political lord of the district, the boss of Chicago's mayor.
<p/>And the other replied, <div class="bookquote">``It's a go, then; I'm your man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Scully/Mike Scully</b></font>)</div>It was Scully who owned the brick-yards and the dump and the ice pond--though Jurgis did not know it.
<p/>It was Scully who was to blame for the unpaved street in which Jurgis's child had been drowned; it was Scully who had put into office the magistrate who had first sent Jurgis to jail; it was Scully who was principal stockholder in the company which had sold him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) the ramshackle tenement, and then robbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) of it.
<p/>But Jurgis knew none of these things--any more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) knew that Scully was but a tool and puppet of the packers.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) Scully was a mighty power, the <div class="bookquote">``biggest''  (<font color='red'><b>Scully/Mike Scully</b></font>)</div>man he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had ever met. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was a little, dried-up Irishman, whose hands shook.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) had a brief talk with his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) visitor, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) ratlike eyes, and making up his (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) mind about him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>); and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) a note to Mr. Harmon, one of the head managers of Durham's--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The bearer, Jurgis Rudkus, is a particular friend of mine, and I would like you to find him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a good place, for important reasons.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was once indiscreet, but you will perhaps be so good as to overlook that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the head managers</b></font>)</div>Mr. Harmon looked up inquiringly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) read this.
<p/>'' What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) mean by `indiscreet'? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) asked. '' I was blacklisted, sir,'' said Jurgis. At which the other frowned.
<p/>'' Blacklisted?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) said. '' How do you mean? '' And Jurgis turned red with embarrassment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) had forgotten that a blacklist did not exist.
<p/>'' I--that is--I had difficulty in getting a place,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) stammered. '' What was the matter?'' <div class="bookquote">``I got into a quarrel with a foreman--not my own boss, sir--and struck him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I see,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other, and meditated for a few moments. '' What do you wish to do? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) asked.
<p/>'' Anything, sir,'' said Jurgis--<div class="bookquote">``only I had a broken arm this winter, and so I have to be careful.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How would it suit you to be a night watchman?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' That wouldn't do, sir. I have to be among the men at night. '' <div class="bookquote">``I see--politics. Well, would it suit you to trim hogs?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harmon</b></font>)</div><p/>And Mr. Harmon called a timekeeper and said, ``Take this man to Pat Murphy and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) to find room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) somehow.
<p/>And so Jurgis marched into the hog-killing room, a place where, in the days gone by, he (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) had come begging for a job.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) walked jauntily, and smiled to himself, seeing the frown that came to the boss's face as the timekeeper said, ``Mr. Harmon says to put this man on.
<p/>It would overcrowd his (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) department and spoil the record he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) was trying to make--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) said not a word except ``All right.
<p/>And so Jurgis became a workingman once more; and straightway he (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) sought out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harmon</b></font>) old friends, and joined the union, and began to <div class="bookquote">``root''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>for <div class="bookquote">``Scotty''  (<font color='red'><b>friends</b></font>)</div>Doyle.
<p/>Doyle had done him (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) a good turn once, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) explained, and was really a bully chap; Doyle was a workingman himself, and would represent the workingmen--why did they want to vote for a millionaire <div class="bookquote">``sheeny,''  (<font color='red'><b>the workingmen</b></font>)</div>and what the hell had Mike Scully ever done for them that they should back his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) candidates all the time?
<p/>And meantime Scully had given Jurgis a note to the Republican leader of the ward, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had gone there and met the crowd he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was to work with.
<p/>Already they had hired a big hall, with some of the brewer's money, and every night Jurgis brought in a dozen new members of the <div class="bookquote">``Doyle Republican Association.
<p/>Pretty soon they had a grand opening night; and there was a brass band, which marched through the streets, and fireworks and bombs and red lights in front of the hall; and there was an enormous crowd, with two overflow meetings--so that the pale and trembling candidate had to recite three times over the little speech which one of Scully's henchmen had written, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had been a month learning by heart.
<p/>Best of all, the famous and eloquent Senator Spareshanks, presidential candidate, rode out in an automobile to discuss the sacred privileges of American citizenship, and protection and prosperity for the American workingman.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) inspiriting address was quoted to the extent of half a column in all the morning newspapers, which also said that it could be stated upon excellent authority that the unexpected popularity developed by Doyle, the Republican candidate for alderman, was giving great anxiety to Mr. Scully, the chairman of the Democratic City Committee.
<p/>The chairman was still more worried when the monster torchlight procession came off, with the members of the Doyle Republican Association all in red capes and hats, and free beer for every voter in the ward--the best beer ever given away in a political campaign, as the whole electorate testified.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a dozen members</b></font>)</div>Yes, sir,'' said Jurgis. '' '' '' '' During this parade, and at innumerable cart-tail meetings as well, Jurgis labored tirelessly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) did not make any speeches--there were lawyers and other experts for that--but he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) helped to manage things; distributing notices and posting placards and bringing out the crowds; and when the show was on he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) attended to the fireworks and the beer.
<p/>Thus in the course of the campaign he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) handled many hundreds of dollars of the Hebrew brewer's money, administering it with naive and touching fidelity.
<p/>Toward the end, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) was regarded with hatred by the rest of the <div class="bookquote">``boys,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>because he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) compelled them either to make a poorer showing than he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) or to do without their share of the pie.
<p/>After that Jurgis did his (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) best to please them, and to make up for the time he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) had lost before he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) discovered the extra bungholes of the campaign barrel.
<p/>On election morning he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) was out at four o'clock, <div class="bookquote">``getting out the vote'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) had a two-horse carriage to ride in, and he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) went from house to house for his (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) friends, and escorted them in triumph to the polls.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) voted half a dozen times himself, and voted some of his (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) friends as often; he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) brought bunch after bunch of the newest foreigners--Lithuanians, Poles, Bohemians, Slovaks--and when he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) had put them through the mill he (<font color='blue'><b>voter</b></font>) turned them over to another man to take to the next polling place.
<p/>When Jurgis first set out, the captain of the precinct gave him (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) a hundred dollars, and three times in the course of the day he (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) came for another hundred, and not more than twenty-five out of each lot got stuck in his (<font color='blue'><b>captain</b></font>) own pocket.
<p/>The balance all went for actual votes, and on a day of Democratic landslides they elected <div class="bookquote">``Scotty''  (<font color='red'><b>Doyle/Doyle Republican Association</b></font>)</div>Doyle, the ex-tenpin setter, by nearly a thousand plurality--and beginning at five o'clock in the afternoon, and ending at three the next morning, Jurgis treated himself to a most unholy and horrible ``jag.
<p/>Nearly every one else in Packingtown did the same, however, for there was universal exultation over this triumph of popular government, this crushing defeat of an arrogant plutocrat by the power of the common people.
<p/>The agitation to break up the police protection of criminals was continuing, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) best to <div class="bookquote">``lay low''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>for the present.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) had nearly three hundred dollars in the bank, and might have considered himself entitled to a vacation; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) had an easy job, and force of habit kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) at it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) pleased Mike Scully, also. '' Chapter 26 After the elections Jurgis stayed on in Packingtown and kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Doyle</b></font>) job. Besides, Mike Scully, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) consulted, advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) that something might <div class="bookquote">``turn up''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>before long.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had already inquired of Aniele, and learned that Elzbieta and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) family had gone downtown, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) gave no further thought to them.
<p/>Jurgis got himself a place in a boardinghouse with some congenial friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) went with a new set, now, young unmarried fellows who were <div class="bookquote">``sporty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>fellows</b></font>)</div><p/>Jurgis had long ago cast off his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) fertilizer clothing, and since going into politics he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had donned a linen collar and a greasy red necktie.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had some reason for thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) dress, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was making about eleven dollars a week, and two-thirds of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) might spend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) pleasures without ever touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) savings.
<p/>Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) would ride down-town with a party of friends to the cheap theaters and the music halls and other haunts with which they were familiar.
<p/>Many of the saloons in Packingtown had pool tables, and some of them bowling alleys, by means of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) could spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) evenings in petty gambling.
<p/>One time Jurgis got into a game on a Saturday night and won prodigiously, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was a man of spirit he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) stayed in with the rest and the game continued until late Sunday afternoon, and by that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``out''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>over twenty dollars.
<p/>On Saturday nights, also, a number of balls were generally given in Packingtown; each man would bring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``girl''  (<font color='red'><b>each man</b></font>)</div>with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), paying half a dollar for a ticket, and several dollars additional for drinks in the course of the festivities, which continued until three or four o'clock in the morning, unless broken up by fighting.
<p/>Also, there were cards and dice. During all this time the same man and woman would dance together, half-stupefied with sensuality and drink.
<p/>Before long Jurgis discovered what Scully had meant by something <div class="bookquote">``turning up. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Scully/Mike Scully</b></font>)</div>In May the agreement between the packers and the unions expired, and a new agreement had to be signed.
<p/>The old scale had dealt with the wages of the skilled men only; and of the members of the Meat Workers' Union about two-thirds were unskilled men.
<p/>In Chicago these latter were receiving, for the most part, eighteen and a half cents an hour, and the unions wished to make this the general wage for the next year.
<p/>It was not nearly so large a wage as it seemed--in the course of the negotiations the union officers examined time checks to the amount of ten thousand dollars, and they found that the highest wages paid had been fourteen dollars a week, and the lowest two dollars and five cents, and the average of the whole, six dollars and sixty-five cents.
<p/>And six dollars and sixty-five cents was hardly too much for a man to keep a family on, considering the fact that the price of dressed meat had increased nearly fifty per cent in the last five years, while the price of <div class="bookquote">``beef on the hoof''  (<font color='red'><b>a family</b></font>)</div>had decreased as much, it would have seemed that the packers ought to be able to pay it; but the packers were unwilling to pay it--they rejected the union demand, and to show what their purpose was, a week or two after the agreement expired they put down the wages of about a thousand men to sixteen and a half cents, and it was said that old man Jones had vowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) would put them to fifteen before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) got through.
<p/>There were a million and a half of men in the country looking for work, a hundred thousand of them right in Chicago; and were the packers to let the union stewards march into their places and bind them to a contract that would lose them several thousand dollars a day for a year?
<p/>All this was in June; and before long the question was submitted to a referendum in the unions, and the decision was for a strike.
<p/>It was the same in all the packing house cities; and suddenly the newspapers and public woke up to face the gruesome spectacle of a meat famine.
<p/>All sorts of pleas for a reconsideration were made, but the packers were obdurate; and all the while they were reducing wages, and heading off shipments of cattle, and rushing in wagon-loads of mattresses and cots.
<p/>So the men boiled over, and one night telegrams went out from the union headquarters to all the big packing centers--to St. Paul, South Omaha, Sioux City, St. Joseph, Kansas City, East St. Louis, and New York--and the next day at noon between fifty and sixty thousand men drew off their working clothes and marched out of the factories, and the great <div class="bookquote">``Beef Strike''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>was on.
<p/>Jurgis went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) dinner, and afterward he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) walked over to see Mike Scully, who lived in a fine house, upon a street which had been decently paved and lighted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) especial benefit.
<p/>Negotiations were going on, and the yards were full of talk of a strike. Not much! Scully had gone into semi-retirement, and looked nervous and worried.
<p/>'' What do you want? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) demanded, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) saw Jurgis. '' I came to see if maybe you could get me a place during the strike,'' the other replied.
<p/>In that morning's papers Jurgis had read a fierce denunciation of the packers by Scully, who had declared that if they did not treat their people better the city authorities would end the matter by tearing down their plants.
<p/>Now, therefore, Jurgis was not a little taken aback when the other demanded suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``See here, Rudkus, why don't you stick by your job?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/>And Scully knit his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) brows and eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) narrowly. Jurgis started. <div class="bookquote">``Work as a scab? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) cried. '' Why not?
<p/>'' demanded Scully. '' What's that to you?'' '' But--but--'' stammered Jurgis. He (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had somehow taken it for granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) should go out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) union.
<p/>The packers need good men, and need them bad,'' continued the other, <div class="bookquote">``and they'll treat a man right that stands by them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>Why don't you take your chance and fix yourself?'' '' But,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``how could I ever be of any use to you--in politics?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You couldn't be it anyhow,''  (<font color='red'><b>Scully/Mike Scully</b></font>)</div>said Scully, abruptly. '' Why not?'' asked Jurgis. '' Hell, man!'' cried the other. '' Don't you know you're a Republican?
<p/>And do you think I'm always going to elect Republicans? My brewer has found out already how we served him (<font color='blue'><b>brewer</b></font>), and there is the deuce to pay.''
<p/>Jurgis looked dumfounded. He (<font color='blue'><b>brewer</b></font>) had never thought of that aspect of it before. '' I could be a Democrat,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Democrat</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' Yes,'' responded the other, <div class="bookquote">``but not right away; a man can't change his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) politics every day. And besides, I don't need you--
<p/>there'd be nothing for you to do. And it's a long time to election day, anyhow; and what are you going to do meantime?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I could count on you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>began Jurgis. '' Yes,'' responded Scully, <div class="bookquote">``so you could--I never yet went back on a friend.
<p/>But is it fair to leave the job I got you and come to me for another? I have had a hundred fellows after me today, and what can I do?
<p/>I've put seventeen men on the city payroll to clean streets this one week, and do you think I can keep that up forever?
<p/>It wouldn't do for me to tell other men what I tell you, but you've been on the inside, and you ought to have sense enough to see for yourself.
<p/>Take my word for it, the strike will be over in a few days, and the men will be beaten; and meantime what you can get out of it will belong to you.
<p/>What have you to gain by a strike?''  (<font color='red'><b>Scully/Mike Scully</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hadn't thought,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>said Jurgis. '' Exactly,'' said Scully, <div class="bookquote">``but you'd better. Do you see?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Scully/Mike Scully</b></font>)</div><p/>The men had left a long line of hogs in various stages of preparation, and the foreman was directing the feeble efforts of a score or two of clerks and stenographers and office boys to finish up the job and get them into the chilling rooms.
<p/>And Jurgis saw. He (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) went back to the yards, and into the workroom. Jurgis went straight up to him (<font color='blue'><b>foreman</b></font>) and announced, <div class="bookquote">``I have come back to work, Mr. Murphy.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The boss's face lighted up. '' Good man! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Come ahead!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just a moment,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>said Jurgis, checking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enthusiasm.
<p/>'' I think I ought to get a little more wages. '' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied the other, <div class="bookquote">``of course. What do you want?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis had debated on the way. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nerve almost failed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clenched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands. '' I think I ought to have' three dollars a day,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said.
<p/>All right,'' said the other, promptly; and before the day was out our friend discovered that the clerks and stenographers and office boys were getting five dollars a day, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could have kicked himself!
<p/>So Jurgis became one of the new <div class="bookquote">``American heroes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>a man whose virtues merited comparison with those of the martyrs of Lexington and Valley Forge.
<p/>The resemblance was not complete, of course, for Jurgis was generously paid and comfortably clad, and was provided with a spring cot and a mattress and three substantial meals a day; also he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was perfectly at ease, and safe from all peril of life and limb, save only in the case that a desire for beer should lead him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to venture outside of the stockyards gates.
<p/>And even in the exercise of this privilege he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not left unprotected; a good part of the inadequate police force of Chicago was suddenly diverted from its work of hunting criminals, and rushed out to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>The police, and the strikers also, were determined that there should be no violence; but there was another party interested which was minded to the contrary--and that was the press.
<p/>Jurgis quit work early, and in a spirit of bravado he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) challenged three men of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquaintance to go outside and get a drink.
<p/>They accepted, and went through the big Halsted Street gate, where several policemen were watching, and also some union pickets, scanning sharply those who passed in and out.
<p/>Jurgis and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companions went south on Halsted Street; past the hotel, and then suddenly half a dozen men started across the street toward them and proceeded to argue with them concerning the error of their ways.
<p/>As the arguments were not taken in the proper spirit, they went on to threats; and suddenly one of them jerked off the hat of one of the four and flung it over the fence.
<p/>The man started after it, and then, as a cry of <div class="bookquote">``Scab!''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>was raised and a dozen people came running out of saloons and doorways, a second man's heart failed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) followed.
<p/>Jurgis and the fourth stayed long enough to give themselves the satisfaction of a quick exchange of blows, and then they, too, took to their heels and fled back of the hotel and into the yards again.
<p/>Meantime, of course, policemen were coming on a run, and as a crowd gathered other police got excited and sent in a riot call.
<p/>Jurgis knew nothing of this, but went back to <div class="bookquote">``Packers' Avenue,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>and in front of the <div class="bookquote">``Central Time Station''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw one of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companions, breathless and wild with excitement, narrating to an ever growing throng how the four had been attacked and surrounded by a howling mob, and had been nearly torn to pieces.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood listening, smiling cynically, several dapper young men stood by that Jurgis saw newsboys running about with armfuls of newspapers, printed in red and black letters six inches high:
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been able to buy all of the newspapers of the United States the next morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have discovered that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beer-hunting exploit was being perused by some two score millions of people, and had served as a text for editorials in half the staid and solemn business-men's newspapers in the land.
<p/>'' On the first day of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life as a strikebreaker VIOLENCE IN THE YARDS! STRIKEBREAKERS SURROUNDED BY FRENZIED MOB! Jurgis was to see more of this as time passed.
<p/>For the present, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work being over, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was free to ride into the city, by a railroad direct from the yards, or else to spend the night in a room where cots had been laid in rows.
<p/>As very few of the better class of workingmen could be got for such work, these specimens of the new American hero contained an assortment of the criminals and thugs of the city, besides Negroes and the lowest foreigners--Greeks, Roumanians, Sicilians, and Slovaks.
<p/>They had been attracted more by the prospect of disorder than by the big wages; and they made the night hideous with singing and carousing, and only went to sleep when the time came for them to get up to work.
<p/>In the morning before Jurgis had finished his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) breakfast, <div class="bookquote">``Pat''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Murphy ordered him (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) to one of the superintendents, who questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) experience in the work of the killing room.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) heart began to thump with excitement, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) divined instantly that his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) hour had come--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) was to be a boss!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) chose the latter, but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Murphy</b></font>) regret, for all night long gangs of strikebreakers kept arriving. Some of the foremen were union members, and many who were not had gone out with the men.
<p/>It was in the killing department that the packers had been left most in the lurch, and precisely here that they could least afford it; the smoking and canning and salting of meat might wait, and all the by-products might be wasted--but fresh meats must be had, or the restaurants and hotels and brownstone houses would feel the pinch, and then <div class="bookquote">``public opinion''  (<font color='red'><b>the packers</b></font>)</div>would take a startling turn.
<p/>An opportunity such as this would not come twice to a man; and Jurgis seized it. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew the work, the whole of it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could teach it to others.
<p/>But if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took the job and gave satisfaction he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would expect to keep it--they would not turn him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off at the end of the strike?
<p/>To which the superintendent replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) might safely trust Durham's for that--they proposed to teach these unions a lesson, and most of all those foremen who had gone back on them.
<p/>Jurgis would receive five dollars a day during the strike, and twenty-five a week after it was settled. So our friend got a pair of <div class="bookquote">``slaughter pen''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>boots and <div class="bookquote">``jeans,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>and flung himself at his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) task.
<p/>It was a weird sight, there on the killing beds--a throng of stupid black Negroes, and foreigners who could not understand a word that was said to them, mixed with pale-faced, hollow-chested bookkeepers and clerks, half-fainting for the tropical heat and the sickening stench of fresh blood--and all struggling to dress a dozen or two cattle in the same place where, twenty-four hours ago, the old killing gang had been speeding, with their marvelous precision, turning out four hundred carcasses every hour!
<p/>The Negroes and the <div class="bookquote">``toughs''  (<font color='red'><b>The Negroes toughs</b></font>)</div>from the Levee did not want to work, and every few minutes some of them would feel obliged to retire and recuperate.
<p/>In a couple of days Durham and Company had electric fans up to cool off the rooms for them, and even couches for them to rest on; and meantime they could go out and find a shady corner and take a <div class="bookquote">``snooze,''  (<font color='red'><b>fans</b></font>)</div>and
<p/>as there was no place for any one in particular, and no system, it might be hours before their boss discovered them.
<p/>As for the poor office employees, they did their best, moved to it by terror; thirty of them had been <div class="bookquote">``fired''  (<font color='red'><b>the office employees</b></font>)</div>in a bunch that first morning for refusing to serve, besides a number of women clerks and typewriters who had declined to act as waitresses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) best, flying here and there, placing them in rows and showing them the tricks; he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) had never given an order in his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) life before, but he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) had taken enough of them to know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) soon fell into the spirit of it, and roared and stormed like any old stager.
<p/>It was such a force as this that Jurgis had to organize. He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) had not the most tractable pupils, however. <div class="bookquote">``See hyar, boss,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>a big black <div class="bookquote">``buck''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>would begin, <div class="bookquote">``ef you doan' like de way
<p/>Ah does dis job, you kin get somebody else to do it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then a crowd would gather and listen, muttering threats.
<p/>After the first meal nearly all the steel knives had been missing, and now every Negro had one, ground to a fine point, hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) boots.
<p/>There was no bringing order out of such a chaos, Jurgis soon discovered; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) fell in with the spirit of the thing--there was no reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) should wear himself out with shouting.
<p/>If hides and guts were slashed and rendered useless there was no way of tracing it to any one; and if a man lay off and forgot to come back there was nothing to be gained by seeking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), for all the rest would quit in the meantime.
<p/>Before long Jurgis found that the custom of resting had suggested to some alert minds the possibility of registering at more than one place and earning more than one five dollars a day.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught a man at this he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``fired''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but it chanced to be in a quiet corner, and the man tendered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a ten-dollar bill and a wink, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took them.
<p/>Everything went, during the strike, and the packers paid. Of course, before long this custom spread, and Jurgis was soon making quite a good income from it.
<p/>In the face of handicaps such as these the packers counted themselves lucky if they could kill off the cattle that had been crippled in transit and the hogs that had developed disease.
<p/>Frequently, in the course of a two or three days' trip, in hot weather and without water, some hog would develop cholera, and die; and the rest would attack him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) had ceased kicking, and when the car was opened there would be nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>themselves</b></font>) left but the bones.
<p/>If all the hogs in this carload were not killed at once, they would soon be down with the dread disease, and there would be nothing to do but make them into lard.
<p/>It was the same with cattle that were gored and dying, or were limping with broken bones stuck through their flesh--they must be killed, even if brokers and buyers and superintendents had to take off their coats and help drive and cut and skin them.
<p/>And meantime, agents of the packers were gathering gangs of Negroes in the country districts of the far South, promising them five dollars a day and board, and being careful not to mention there was a strike; already carloads of them were on the way, with special rates from the railroads, and all traffic ordered out of the way.
<p/>Many towns and cities were taking advantage of the chance to clear out their jails and workhouses--in Detroit the magistrates would release every man who agreed to leave town within twenty-four hours, and agents of the packers were in the courtrooms to ship them right.
<p/>And meantime trainloads of supplies were coming in for their accommodation, including beer and whisky, so that they might not be tempted to go outside.
<p/>They hired thirty young girls in Cincinnati to <div class="bookquote">``pack fruit,''  (<font color='red'><b>girls</b></font>)</div>and when they arrived put them at work canning corned beef, and put cots for them to sleep in a public hallway, through which the men passed.
<p/>As the gangs came in day and night, under the escort of squads of police, they stowed away in unused workrooms and storerooms, and in the car sheds, crowded so closely together that the cots touched.
<p/>In some places they would use the same room for eating and sleeping, and at night the men would put their cots upon the tables, to keep away from the swarms of rats.
<p/>Ninety per cent of the men had walked out; and they faced the task of completely remaking their labor force--and with the price of meat up thirty per cent, and the public clamoring for a settlement.
<p/>They made an offer to submit the whole question at issue to arbitration; and at the end of ten days the unions accepted it, and the strike was called off.
<p/>It was agreed that all the men were to be re-employed within forty-five days, and that there was to be <div class="bookquote">``no discrimination against union men.
<p/>But with all their best efforts, the packers were demoralized. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>This was an anxious time for Jurgis. If the men were taken back <div class="bookquote">``without discrimination,''  (<font color='red'><b>the men</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>packers</b></font>) would lose his (<font color='blue'><b>packers</b></font>) present place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>packers</b></font>) sought out the superintendent, who smiled grimly and bade him (<font color='blue'><b>packers</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``wait and see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Durham's strikebreakers were few of them leaving.
<p/>Whether or not the <div class="bookquote">``settlement''  (<font color='red'><b>the packers</b></font>)</div>was simply a trick of the packers to gain time, or whether they really expected to break the strike and cripple the unions by the plan, cannot be said; but that night there went out from the office of Durham and Company a telegram to all the big packing centers, <div class="bookquote">``Employ no union leaders.
<p/>And in the morning, when the twenty thousand men thronged into the yards, with their dinner pails and working clothes, Jurgis stood near the door of the hog-trimming room, where he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had worked before the strike, and saw a throng of eager men, with a score or two of policemen watching them; and he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) saw a superintendent come out and walk down the line, and pick out man after man that pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and one after another came, and there were some men up near the head of the line who were never picked--they being the union stewards and delegates, and the men Jurgis had heard making speeches at the meetings.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the packers</b></font>)</div>Each time, of course, there were louder murmurings and angrier looks. Over where the cattle butchers were waiting, Jurgis heard shouts and saw a crowd, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hurried there.
<p/>One big butcher, who was president of the Packing Trades Council, had been passed over five times, and the men were wild with rage; they had appointed a committee of three to go in and see the superintendent, and the committee had made three attempts, and each time the police had clubbed them back from the door.
<p/>Then there were yells and hoots, continuing until at last the superintendent came to the door. '' We all go back or none of us do!
<p/>And the other shook his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) fist at them, and shouted, <div class="bookquote">``You went out of here like cattle, and like cattle you'll come back!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' cried a hundred voices. Then suddenly the big butcher president leaped upon a pile of stones and yelled: ``It's off, boys.
<p/>And so the cattle butchers declared a new strike on the spot; and gathering their members from the other plants, where the same trick had been played, they marched down Packers' Avenue, which was thronged with a dense mass of workers, cheering wildly.
<p/>Men who had already got to work on the killing beds dropped their tools and joined them; some galloped here and there on horseback, shouting the tidings, and within half an hour the whole of Packingtown was on strike again, and beside itself with fury.
<p/>There was quite a different tone in Packingtown after this--the place was a seething caldron of passion, and the <div class="bookquote">``scab''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>who ventured into it fared badly.
<p/>There were one or two of these incidents each day, the newspapers detailing them, and always blaming them upon the unions.
<p/>Yet ten years before, when there were no unions in Packingtown, there was a strike, and national troops had to be called, and there were pitched battles fought at night, by the light of blazing freight trains.
<p/>Packingtown was always a center of violence; in <div class="bookquote">``Whisky Point,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>where there were a hundred saloons and one glue factory, there was always fighting, and always more of it in hot weather.
<p/>Any one who had taken the trouble to consult the station house blotter would have found that there was less violence that summer than ever before--and this while twenty thousand men were out of work, and with nothing to do all day but brood upon bitter wrongs.
<p/>There was no one to picture the battle the union leaders were fighting--to hold this huge army in rank, to keep it from straggling and pillaging, to cheer and encourage and guide a hundred thousand people, of a dozen different tongues, through six long weeks of hunger and disappointment and despair.
<p/>We'll all of us quit again! '' Meantime the packers had set themselves definitely to the task of making a new labor force.
<p/>Some of them were experienced workers,--butchers, salesmen, and managers from the packers' branch stores, and a few union men who had deserted from other cities; but the vast majority were <div class="bookquote">``green''  (<font color='red'><b>the majority</b></font>)</div>Negroes from the cotton districts of the far South, and they were herded into the packing plants like sheep.
<p/>There was a law forbidding the use of buildings as lodging-houses unless they were licensed for the purpose, and provided with proper windows, stairways, and fire escapes; but here, in a <div class="bookquote">``paint room,''  (<font color='red'><b>a men</b></font>)</div>reached only by an enclosed <div class="bookquote">``chute,''  (<font color='red'><b>a men</b></font>)</div>a room without a single window and only one door, a hundred men were crowded upon mattresses on the floor.
<p/>Up on the third story of the <div class="bookquote">``hog house''  (<font color='red'><b>Jones</b></font>)</div>of Jones's was a storeroom, without a window, into which they crowded seven hundred men, sleeping upon the bare springs of cots, and with a second shift to use them by day.
<p/>And when the clamor of the public led to an investigation into these conditions, and the mayor of the city was forced to order the enforcement of the law, the packers got a judge to issue an injunction forbidding him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) to do it!
<p/>Just at this time the mayor was boasting that he (<font color='blue'><b>mayor</b></font>) had put an end to gambling and prize fighting in the city; but here a swarm of professional gamblers had leagued themselves with the police to fleece the strikebreakers; and any night, in the big open space in front of Brown's, one might see brawny Negroes stripped to the waist and pounding each other for money, while a howling throng of three or four thousand surged about, men and women, young white girls from the country rubbing elbows with big buck Negroes with daggers in their boots, while rows of woolly heads peered down from every window of the surrounding factories.
<p/>The ancestors of these black people had been savages in Africa; and since then they had been chattel slaves, or had been held down by a community ruled by the traditions of slavery.
<p/>A thousand or two of strikebreakers were brought in every night, and distributed among the various plants. Now for the first time they were free--free to gratify every passion, free to wreck themselves.
<p/>They were wanted to break a strike, and when it was broken they would be shipped away, and their present masters would never see them again; and so whisky and women were brought in by the carload and sold to them, and hell was let loose in the yards.
<p/>Every night there were stabbings and shootings; it was said that the packers had blank permits, which enabled them to ship dead bodies from the city without troubling the authorities.
<p/>They lodged men and women on the same floor; and with the night there began a saturnalia of debauchery--scenes such as never before had been witnessed in America.
<p/>And as the women were the dregs from the brothels of Chicago, and the men were for the most part ignorant country Negroes, the nameless diseases of vice were soon rife; and this where food was being handled which was sent out to every corner of the civilized world.
<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``Union Stockyards''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were never a pleasant place; but now they were not only a collection of slaughterhouses, but also the camping place of an army of fifteen or twenty thousand human beasts.
<p/>All day long the blazing midsummer sun beat down upon that square mile of abominations: upon tens of thousands of cattle crowded into pens whose wooden floors stank and steamed contagion; upon bare, blistering, cinder-strewn railroad tracks, and huge blocks of dingy meat factories, whose labyrinthine passages defied a breath of fresh air to penetrate them; and there were not merely rivers of hot blood, and car-loads of moist flesh, and rendering vats and soap caldrons, glue factories and fertilizer tanks, that smelt like the craters of hell
<p/>--there were also tons of garbage festering in the sun, and the greasy laundry of the workers hung out to dry, and dining rooms littered with food and black with flies, and toilet rooms that were open sewers.
<p/>And then at night, when this throng poured out into the streets to play--fighting, gambling, drinking and carousing, cursing and screaming, laughing and singing, playing banjoes and dancing!
<p/>They were worked in the yards all the seven days of the week, and they had their prize fights and crap games on Sunday nights as well; but then around the corner one might see a bonfire blazing, and an old, gray-headed Negress, lean and witchlike, her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hair flying wild and her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) eyes blazing, yelling and chanting of the fires of perdition and the blood of the <div class="bookquote">``Lamb,''  (<font color='red'><b>an Negress hair</b></font>)</div>while men and women lay down upon the ground and moaned and screamed in convulsions of terror and remorse.
<p/>Such were the stockyards during the strike; while the unions watched in sullen despair, and the country clamored like a greedy child for its food, and the packers went grimly on their way.
<p/>Each day they added new workers, and could be more stern with the old ones--could put them on piecework, and dismiss them if they did not keep up the pace.
<p/>Jurgis was now one of their agents in this process; and he (<font color='blue'><b>agents</b></font>) could feel the change day by day, like the slow starting up of a huge machine.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agents</b></font>) had gotten used to being a master of men; and because of the stifling heat and the stench, and the fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>agents</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``scab''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and knew it and despised himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>agents</b></font>) was drinking, and developing a villainous temper, and he (<font color='blue'><b>agents</b></font>) stormed and cursed and raged at his (<font color='blue'><b>agents</b></font>) men, and drove them until they were ready to drop with exhaustion.
<p/>Then one day late in August, a superintendent ran into the place and shouted to Jurgis and his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) gang to drop their work and come.
<p/>They followed him (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) outside, to where, in the midst of a dense throng, they saw several two-horse trucks waiting, and three patrol-wagon loads of police.
<p/>Jurgis and his (<font color='blue'><b>superintendent</b></font>) men sprang upon one of the trucks, and the driver yelled to the crowd, and they went thundering away at a gallop.
<p/>Some steers had just escaped from the yards, and the strikers had got hold of them, and there would be the chance of a scrap!
<p/>There was a yell as soon as they were sighted, men and women rushing out of houses and saloons as they galloped by.
<p/>There were eight or ten policemen on the truck, however, and there was no disturbance until they came to a place where the street was blocked with a dense throng.
<p/>Those on the flying truck yelled a warning and the crowd scattered pell-mell, disclosing one of the steers lying in its blood.
<p/>There were a good many cattle butchers about just then, with nothing much to do, and hungry children at home; and so some one had knocked out the steer--and as a first-class man can kill and dress one in a couple of minutes, there were a good many steaks and roasts already missing.
<p/>This called for punishment, of course; and the police proceeded to administer it by leaping from the truck and cracking at every head they saw.
<p/>There were yells of rage and pain, and the terrified people fled into houses and stores, or scattered helter-skelter down the street.
<p/>Jurgis and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gang joined in the sport, every man singling out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) victim, and striving to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to bay and punch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fled into a house his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursuer would smash in the flimsy door and follow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up the stairs, hitting every one who came within reach, and finally dragging his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) squealing quarry from under a bed or a pile of old clothes in a closet.
<p/>They went out at the Ashland Avenue gate, and over in the direction of the <div class="bookquote">``dump. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis and two policemen chased some men into a bar-room.
<p/>One of them took shelter behind the bar, where a policeman cornered him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) and proceeded to whack him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) over the back and shoulders, until he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) lay down and gave a chance at his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) head.
<p/>The others leaped a fence in the rear, balking the second policeman, who was fat; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) came back, furious and cursing, a big Polish woman, the owner of the saloon, rushed in screaming, and received a poke in the stomach that doubled her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) up on the floor.
<p/>Meantime Jurgis, who was of a practical temper, was helping himself at the bar; and the first policeman, who had laid out his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) man, joined him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>), handing out several more bottles, and filling his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) pockets besides, and then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) started to leave, cleaning off all the balance with a sweep of his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) club.
<p/>The din of the glass crashing to the floor brought the fat Polish woman to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feet again, but another policeman came up behind her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and put his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) knee into her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back and his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) hands over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes--and then called to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) companion, who went back and broke open the cash drawer and filled his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) pockets with the contents.
<p/>Then the three went outside, and the man who was holding the woman gave her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a shove and dashed out himself.
<p/>The gang having already got the carcass on to the truck, the party set out at a trot, followed by screams and curses, and a shower of bricks and stones from unseen enemies.
<p/>These bricks and stones would figure in the accounts of the <div class="bookquote">``riot''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which would be sent out to a few thousand newspapers within an hour or two; but the episode of the cash drawer would never be mentioned again, save only in the heartbreaking legends of Packingtown.
<p/>It was late in the afternoon when they got back, and they dressed out the remainder of the steer, and a couple of others that had been killed, and then knocked off for the day.
<p/>Jurgis went downtown to supper, with three friends who had been on the other trucks, and they exchanged reminiscences on the way.
<p/>To console himself he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) had to drink a good deal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) went back to Packingtown about two o'clock in the morning, very much the worse for his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) excursion, and, it must be confessed, entirely deserving the calamity that was in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) was going to the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) slept, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) met a painted-cheeked woman in a greasy <div class="bookquote">``kimono,''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arm about his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) waist to steady him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>); they turned into a dark room they were passing--but scarcely had they taken two steps before suddenly a door swung open, and a man entered, carrying a lantern.
<p/>Afterward they drifted into a roulette parlor, and Jurgis, who was never lucky at gambling, dropped about fifteen dollars. '' Who's there?
<p/>And Jurgis started to mutter some reply; but at the same instant the man raised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) light, which flashed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, so that it was possible to recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called sharply. Jurgis stood stricken dumb, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart gave a leap like a mad thing. The man was Connor!
<p/>Connor, the boss of the loading gang! The man who had seduced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife--who had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to prison, and wrecked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home, ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life!
<p/>Jurgis had often thought of Connor since coming back to Packingtown, but it had been as of something far off, that no longer concerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>).
<p/>Now, however, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>), alive and in the flesh, the same thing happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) that had happened before--a flood of rage boiled up in him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>), a blind frenzy seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>).
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) flung himself at the man, and smote him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) between the eyes--and then, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) fell, seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) by the throat and began to pound his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) head upon the stones.
<p/>The lantern had been upset and extinguished, and it was so dark they could not see a thing; but they could hear Jurgis panting, and hear the thumping of his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) victim's skull, and they rushed there and tried to pull him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) off.
<p/>Precisely as before, Jurgis came away with a piece of his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) enemy's flesh between his (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) teeth; and, as before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) went on fighting with those who had interfered with him (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>), until a policeman had come and beaten him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) into insensibility.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) stood there, staring, with the light shining full upon him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>). The woman began screaming, and people came rushing in. And so Jurgis spent the balance of the night in the stockyards station house.
<p/>This time, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had money in his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) pocket, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) came to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) senses he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) could get something to drink, and also a messenger to take word of his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) plight to <div class="bookquote">``Bush''  (<font color='red'><b>a messenger</b></font>)</div>Harper.
<p/>Harper did not appear, however, until after the prisoner, feeling very weak and ill, had been hailed into court and remanded at five hundred dollars' bail to await the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) victim's injuries.
<p/>Jurgis was wild about this, because a different magistrate had chanced to be on the bench, and he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had stated that he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had never been arrested before, and also that he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) had been attacked first--and if only someone had been there to speak a good word for him (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>magistrate</b></font>) could have been let off at once.
<p/>But Harper explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) had been downtown, and had not got the message. '' What's happened to you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) asked.
<p/>'' I've been doing a fellow up,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``and I've got to get five hundred dollars' bail. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can arrange that all right,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the other--<div class="bookquote">``though it may cost you a few dollars, of course.
<p/>But what was the trouble?''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>'' It was a man that did me a mean trick once,'' answered Jurgis. '' Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a foreman in Brown's or used to be. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name's Connor. '' And the other gave a start. <div class="bookquote">``Connor!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) cried. '' Not Phil Connor!'' '' Yes,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``that's the fellow. Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good God!''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the other, ``then you're in for it, old man!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s one of Scully's biggest men--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a member of the War-Whoop League, and they talked of sending him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the legislature!
<p/>I can't help you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not help me! Why not?''  (<font color='red'><b>Connor/Phil Connor</b></font>)</div>Phil Connor! Great heavens!'' Jurgis sat dumb with dismay. '' Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) can send you to Joliet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Connor</b></font>) wants to!'' declared the other.
<p/>'' Can't I have Scully get me off before he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) finds out about it? '' asked Jurgis, at length. '' But Scully's out of town,'' the other answered.
<p/>'' I don't even know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) is--he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>)'s run away to dodge the strike. '' That was a pretty mess, indeed.
<p/>Poor Jurgis sat half-dazed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) pull had run up against a bigger pull, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was down and out! '' But what am I going to do?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) asked, weakly. '' How should I know?'' said the other. '' I shouldn't even dare to get bail for you--why, I might ruin myself for life!''
<p/>Again there was silence. '' Can't you do it for me,'' Jurgis asked, <div class="bookquote">``and pretend that you didn't know who I'd hit?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But what good would that do you when you came to stand trial?'' asked Harper. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) sat buried in thought for a minute or two.
<p/>'' There's nothing--unless it's this,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) said. '' I could have your bail reduced; and then if you had the money you could pay it and skip.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How much will it be?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Jurgis asked, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) had had this explained more in detail. '' I don't know,'' said the other.
<p/>'' How much do you own?'' <div class="bookquote">``I've got about three hundred dollars,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer. '' Well,'' was Harper's reply, ``I'm not sure, but I'll try and get you off for that.
<p/>I'll take the risk for friendship's sake-- for I'd hate to see you sent to state's prison for a year or two.
<p/>And so finally Jurgis ripped out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) bankbook--which was sewed up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) trousers--and signed an order, which <div class="bookquote">``Bush''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>Harper wrote, for all the money to be paid out.
<p/>Then the latter went and got it, and hurried to the court, and explained to the magistrate that Jurgis was a decent fellow and a friend of Scully's, who had been attacked by a strike-breaker.
<p/>So the bail was reduced to three hundred dollars, and Harper went on it himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) did not tell this to Jurgis, however--nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) that when the time for trial came it would be an easy matter for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) to avoid the forfeiting of the bail, and pocket the three hundred dollars as his (<font color='blue'><b>Harper</b></font>) reward for the risk of offending Mike Scully!
<p/>All that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) told Jurgis was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was now free, and that the best thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) could do was to clear out as quickly as possible; and so Jurgis overwhelmed with gratitude and relief, took the dollar and fourteen cents that was left him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) out of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) bank account, and put it with the two dollars and quarter that was left from his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) last night's celebration, and boarded a streetcar and got off at the other end of Chicago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was crippled--he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was as literally crippled as any wild animal which has lost its claws, or been torn out of its shell.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had been shorn, at one cut, of all those mysterious weapons whereby he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had been able to make a living easily and to escape the consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) actions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) could no longer command a job when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) wanted it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) could no longer steal with impunity--he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) must take his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) chances with the common herd.
<p/>'' Chapter 27 Poor Jurgis was now an outcast and a tramp once more. Nay worse, he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) dared not mingle with the herd--he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) must hide himself, for he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) was one marked out for destruction.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) old companions would betray him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>), for the sake of the influence they would gain thereby; and he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) would be made to suffer, not merely for the offense he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) had committed, but for others which would be laid at his (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) door, just as had been done for some poor devil on the occasion of that assault upon the <div class="bookquote">``country customer''  (<font color='red'><b>some devil</b></font>)</div>by him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) and Duane.
<p/>And also he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) labored under another handicap now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had acquired new standards of living, which were not easily to be altered.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had been out of work before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had been content if he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) could sleep in a doorway or under a truck out of the rain, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) could get fifteen cents a day for saloon lunches.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) must have a drink now and then, a drink for its own sake, and apart from the food that came with it.
<p/>The craving for it was strong enough to master every other consideration--he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) would have it, though it were his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) last nickel and he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had to starve the balance of the day in consequence.
<p/>But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) desired all sorts of other things, and suffered because he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) had to do without them. Jurgis became once more a besieger of factory gates.
<p/>For one thing, there was the economic crisis, the million or two of men who had been out of work in the spring and summer, and were not yet all back, by any means.
<p/>And then there was the strike, with seventy thousand men and women all over the country idle for a couple of months--twenty thousand in Chicago, and many of them now seeking work throughout the city.
<p/>It did not remedy matters that a few days later the strike was given up and about half the strikers went back to work; for every one taken on, there was a <div class="bookquote">``scab''  (<font color='red'><b>the strikers</b></font>)</div>who gave up and fled.
<p/>But never since he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had been in Chicago had he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) stood less chance of getting a job than just then. The ten or fifteen thousand <div class="bookquote">``green''  (<font color='red'><b>The Negroes foreigners criminals</b></font>)</div>Negroes, foreigners, and criminals were now being turned loose to shift for themselves.
<p/>Everywhere Jurgis went he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) kept meeting them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was in an agony of fear lest some one of them should know that he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``wanted.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) would have left Chicago, only by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had realized his (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) danger he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was almost penniless; and it would be better to go to jail than to be caught out in the country in the winter time.
<p/>At the end of about ten days Jurgis had only a few pennies left; and he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had not yet found a job--not even a day's work at anything, not a chance to carry a satchel.
<p/>Once again, as when he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) had come out of the hospital, he (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) was bound hand and foot, and facing the grisly phantom of starvation.
<p/>Raw, naked terror possessed him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>), a maddening passion that would never leave him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>), and that wore him (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>) down more quickly than the actual want of food.
<p/>The fiend reached out its scaly arms for him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>)--it touched him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>), its breath came into his (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) face; and he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) would cry out for the awfulness of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) would wake up in the night, shuddering, and bathed in perspiration, and start up and flee.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) would walk, begging for work, until he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) was exhausted; he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) could not remain still--he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) would wander on, gaunt and haggard, gazing about him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) with restless eyes.
<p/>Everywhere he (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>) went, from one end of the vast city to the other, there were hundreds of others like him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>); everywhere was the sight of plenty and the merciless hand of authority waving them away.
<p/>There is one kind of prison where the man is behind bars, and everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desires is outside; and there is another kind where the things are behind the bars, and the man is outside.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was down to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last quarter, Jurgis learned that before the bakeshops closed at night they sold out what was left at half price, and after that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would go and get two loaves of stale bread for a nickel, and break them up and stuff his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets with them, munching a bit from time to time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not spend a penny save for this; and, after two or three days more, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even became sparing of the bread, and would stop and peer into the ash barrels as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked along the streets, and now and then rake out a bit of something, shake it free from dust, and count himself just so many minutes further from the end.
<p/>So for several days he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been going about, ravenous all the time, and growing weaker and weaker, and then one morning he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a hideous experience, that almost broke his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was passing down a street lined with warehouses, and a boss offered him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) a job, and then, after he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) had started to work, turned him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) off because he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was not strong enough.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) stood by and saw another man put into his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) place, and then picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) coat, and walked off, doing all that he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) could to keep from breaking down and crying like a baby.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was going to die of hunger! He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was lost! He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was doomed! There was no hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>)! But then, with a sudden rush, his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) fear gave place to rage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) would come back there after dark, and he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) would show that scoundrel whether he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was good for anything or not!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) was still muttering this when suddenly, at the corner, he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) came upon a green-grocery, with a tray full of cabbages in front of it.
<p/>Jurgis, after one swift glance about him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>), stooped and seized the biggest of them, and darted round the corner with it.
<p/>There was a hue and cry, and a score of men and boys started in chase of him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) came to an alley, and then to another branching off from it and leading him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) into another street, where he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) fell into a walk, and slipped his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) cabbage under his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) coat and went off unsuspected in the crowd.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) had gotten a safe distance away he (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) sat down and devoured half the cabbage raw, stowing the balance away in his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) pockets till the next day.
<p/>Just about this time one of the Chicago newspapers, which made much of the <div class="bookquote">``common people,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>opened a <div class="bookquote">``free-soup kitchen''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>for the benefit of the unemployed.
<p/>Some people said that they did this for the sake of the advertising it gave them, and some others said that their motive was a fear lest all their readers should be starved off; but whatever the reason, the soup was thick and hot, and there was a bowl for every man, all night long.
<p/>When Jurgis heard of this, from a fellow <div class="bookquote">``hobo,''  (<font color='red'><b>a fellow</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) vowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would have half a dozen bowls before morning; but, as it proved, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was lucky to get one, for there was a line of men two blocks long before the stand, and there was just as long a line when the place was finally closed up.
<p/>This depot was within the danger line for Jurgis--in the <div class="bookquote">``Levee''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>district, where he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was known; but he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went there, all the same, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was desperate, and beginning to think of even the Bridewell as a place of refuge.
<p/>So far the weather had been fair, and he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had slept out every night in a vacant lot; but now there fell suddenly a shadow of the advancing winter, a chill wind from the north and a driving storm of rain.
<p/>That day Jurgis bought two drinks for the sake of the shelter, and at night he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) spent his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) last two pennies in a ``stale-beer dive.
<p/>This was a place kept by a Negro, who went out and drew off the old dregs of beer that lay in barrels set outside of the saloons; and after he (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) had doctored it with chemicals to make it <div class="bookquote">``fizz,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) sold it for two cents a can, the purchase of a can including the privilege of sleeping the night through upon the floor, with a mass of degraded outcasts, men and women.
<p/>All these horrors afflicted Jurgis all the more cruelly, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) was always contrasting them with the opportunities he (<font color='blue'><b>Negro</b></font>) had lost.
<p/>For instance, just now it was election time again--within five or six weeks the voters of the country would select a President; and he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) heard the wretches with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) associated discussing it, and saw the streets of the city decorated with placards and banners--and what words could describe the pangs of grief and despair that shot through him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had begged all day, for his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) very life, and found not a soul to heed him (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>), until toward evening he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) saw an old lady getting off a streetcar and helped her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) down with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) umbrellas and bundles and then told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``hard-luck story,''  (<font color='red'><b>an lady</b></font>)</div>and after answering all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) suspicious questions satisfactorily, was taken to a restaurant and saw a quarter paid down for a meal.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) had soup and bread, and boiled beef and potatoes and beans, and pie and coffee, and came out with his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) skin stuffed tight as a football.
<p/>And then, through the rain and the darkness, far down the street he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) saw red lights flaring and heard the thumping of a bass drum; and his (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) heart gave a leap, and he (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) made for the place on the run--knowing without the asking that it meant a political meeting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>President</b></font>) fell to cursing. '' For instance, there was a night during this cold spell. The campaign had so far been characterized by what the newspapers termed ``apathy.
<p/>For some reason the people refused to get excited over the struggle, and it was almost impossible to get them to come to meetings, or to make any noise when they did come.
<p/>Those which had been held in Chicago so far had proven most dismal failures, and tonight, the speaker being no less a personage than a candidate for the vice-presidency of the nation, the political managers had been trembling with anxiety.
<p/>But a merciful providence had sent this storm of cold rain--and now all it was necessary to do was to set off a few fireworks, and thump awhile on a drum, and all the homeless wretches from a mile around would pour in and fill the hall!
<p/>And then on the morrow the newspapers would have a chance to report the tremendous ovation, and to add that it had been no <div class="bookquote">``silk-stocking''  (<font color='red'><b>no audience</b></font>)</div>audience, either, proving clearly that the high tariff sentiments of the distinguished candidate were pleasing to the wage-earners of the nation.
<p/>So Jurgis found himself in a large hall, elaborately decorated with flags and bunting; and after the chairman had made his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) little speech, and the orator of the evening rose up, amid an uproar from the band--only fancy the emotions of Jurgis upon making the discovery that the personage was none other than the famous and eloquent Senator Spareshanks, who had addressed the <div class="bookquote">``Doyle Republican Association''  (<font color='red'><b>Spareshanks</b></font>)</div>at the stockyards, and helped to elect Mike Scully's tenpin setter to the Chicago Board of Aldermen!
<p/>What agony it was to him (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) to look back upon those golden hours, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>), too, had a place beneath the shadow of the plum tree!
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>), too, had been of the elect, through whom the country is governed--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) had had a bung in the campaign barrel for his (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) own!
<p/>And this was another election in which the Republicans had all the money; and but for that one hideous accident he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) might have had a share of it, instead of being where he (<font color='blue'><b>Scully</b></font>) was!
<p/>The eloquent senator was explaining the system of protection; an ingenious device whereby the workingman permitted the manufacturer to charge him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) higher prices, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) might receive higher wages; thus taking his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) money out of his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) pocket with one hand, and putting a part of it back with the other.
<p/>'' In truth, the sight of the senator almost brought the tears into Jurgis's eyes. To the senator this unique arrangement had somehow become identified with the higher verities of the universe.
<p/>It was because of it that Columbia was the gem of the ocean; and all her (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) future triumphs, her (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) power and good repute among the nations, depended upon the zeal and fidelity with which each citizen held up the hands of those who were toiling to maintain it.
<p/>The name of this heroic company was <div class="bookquote">``the Grand Old Party'' (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>-- And here the band began to play, and Jurgis sat up with a violent start.
<p/>Singular as it may seem, Jurgis was making a desperate effort to understand what the senator was saying--to comprehend the extent of American prosperity, the enormous expansion of American commerce, and the Republic's future in the Pacific and in South America, and wherever else the oppressed were groaning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) knew that if he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) allowed himself to fall asleep he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) would begin to snore loudly; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) must listen--he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) must be interested!
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) had eaten such a big dinner, and he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was so exhausted, and the hall was so warm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) seat was so comfortable!
<p/>The senator's gaunt form began to grow dim and hazy, to tower before him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) and dance about, with figures of exports and imports.
<p/>Once his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) neighbor gave him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) a savage poke in the ribs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) sat up with a start and tried to look innocent; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was at it again, and men began to stare at him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) with annoyance, and to call out in vexation.
<p/>Finally one of them called a policeman, who came and grabbed Jurgis by the collar, and jerked him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) feet, bewildered and terrified.
<p/>Some of the audience turned to see the commotion, and Senator Spareshanks faltered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Senator</b></font>) speech; but a voice shouted cheerily: <div class="bookquote">``We're just firing a bum!
<p/>And so the crowd roared, and the senator smiled genially, and went on; and in a few seconds poor Jurgis found himself landed out in the rain, with a kick and a string of curses.
<p/>The reason for it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) wanted to keep awake. Go ahead, old sport! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Spareshanks</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) got into the shelter of a doorway and took stock of himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was not hurt, and he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was not arrested--more than he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) had any right to expect. He (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) swore at himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) luck for a while, and then turned his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) thoughts to practical matters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) had no money, and no place to sleep; he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) must begin begging again. He (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) went out, hunching his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) shoulders together and shivering at the touch of the icy rain.
<p/>Coming down the street toward him (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was a lady, well dressed, and protected by an umbrella; and he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) turned and walked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>'' Please, ma'am,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``could you lend me the price of a night's lodging? I'm a poor working-man-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) stopped short.
<p/>By the light of a street lamp he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) had caught sight of the lady's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). It was Alena Jasaityte, who had been the belle of his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) wedding feast!
<p/>Jurgis had only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasaityte</b></font>) once or twice afterward, for Juozas had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasaityte</b></font>) over for another girl, and Alena had gone away from Packingtown, no one knew where.
<p/>Alena Jasaityte, who had looked so beautiful, and danced with such a queenly air, with Juozas Raczius, the teamster! And now he (<font color='blue'><b>teamster</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasaityte</b></font>) here!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jasaityte</b></font>) was as much surprised as he (<font color='blue'><b>teamster</b></font>) was. '' Jurgis Rudkus! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jasaityte</b></font>) gasped. '' And what in the world is the matter with you?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I--I've had hard luck,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>teamster</b></font>) stammered. '' I'm out of work, and I've no home and no money. And you, Alena--are you married?''
<p/>'' No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I'm not married, but I've got a good place. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They stood staring at each other for a few moments longer.
<p/>it happens that I've come out without my purse, and I honestly haven't a penny with me: I can do something better for you, though--I can tell you how to get help.
<p/>Finally Alena spoke again. '' Jurgis,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'd help you if I could, upon my word I would, but I can tell you where Marija is.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Jurgis gave a start. <div class="bookquote">``Marija!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Yes,'' said Alena; <div class="bookquote">``and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>)'ll help you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>)'s got a place, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alena</b></font>)'s doing well
<p/>It was not much more than a year since Jurgis had left Packingtown, feeling like one escaped from jail; and it had been from Marija and Elzbieta that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was escaping.
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>)'ll be glad to see you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Alena/Alena Jasaityte/Jasaityte</b></font>)</div>But now, at the mere mention of them, his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) whole being cried out with joy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wanted to see them; he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wanted to go home! They would help him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)--they would be kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). In a flash he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had thought over the situation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had a good excuse for running away--his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) grief at the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) son; and also he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had a good excuse for not returning--the fact that they had left Packingtown.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a number on Clark Street, adding, <div class="bookquote">``There's no need to give you my address, because Marija knows it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Clark</b></font>)</div>All right,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I'll go. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And Jurgis set out, without further ado. He (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) found a large brownstone house of aristocratic appearance, and rang the basement bell.
<p/>A young colored girl came to the door, opening it about an inch, and gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) suspiciously. '' What do you want?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) demanded. '' Does Marija Berczynskas live here? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>) inquired. '' I dunno,'' said the girl. '' What you want wid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Clark</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s a relative of mine. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The girl hesitated a moment. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) opened the door and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come in.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Jurgis came and stood in the hall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) continued: <div class="bookquote">``I'll go see. What's yo' name?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) it's Jurgis,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) answered, and the girl went upstairs.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came back at the end of a minute or two, and replied, <div class="bookquote">``Dey ain't no sich person here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>Jurgis's heart went down into his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) boots.
<p/>'' I was told this was where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lived! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) cried. But the girl only shook her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head. '' De lady says dey ain't no sich person here,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) stood for a moment, hesitating, helpless with dismay. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) turned to go to the door. At the same instant, however, there came a knock upon it, and the girl went to open it.
<p/>Jurgis heard the shuffling of feet, and then heard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) give a cry; and the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sprang back, and past him (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes shining white with terror, and bounded up the stairway, screaming at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lungs:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Police! Police! We're pinched!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Jurgis stood for a second, bewildered. Then, seeing blue-coated forms rushing upon him (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) sprang after the Negress.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cries had been the signal for a wild uproar above; the house was full of people, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) entered the hallway he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) saw them rushing hither and thither, crying and screaming with alarm.
<p/>There were men and women, the latter clad for the most part in wrappers, the former in all stages of dishabille.
<p/>At one side Jurgis caught a glimpse of a big apartment with plush-covered chairs, and tables covered with trays and glasses.
<p/>There were playing cards scattered all over the floor--one of the tables had been upset, and bottles of wine were rolling about, their contents running out upon the carpet.
<p/>There was a young girl who had fainted, and two men who were supporting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and there were a dozen others crowding toward the front door.
<p/>At the same instant a stout woman, with painted cheeks and diamonds in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ears, came running down the stairs, panting breathlessly: <div class="bookquote">``To the rear!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) led the way to a back staircase, Jurgis following; in the kitchen she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pressed a spring, and a cupboard gave way and opened, disclosing a dark passageway.
<p/>Suddenly, however, there came a series of resounding blows upon it, causing the crowd to give back. Quick! ''  (<font color='red'><b>a stout woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go in!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Scarcely had the last one disappeared, however, before there were cries from in front, and then the panic-stricken throng poured out again, exclaiming: <div class="bookquote">``They're there too!
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried to the crowd, which now amounted to twenty or thirty, and they began to pass through. We're trapped!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Upstairs!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>cried the woman, and there was another rush of the mob, women and men cursing and screaming and fighting to be first.
<p/>One flight, two, three--and then there was a ladder to the roof, with a crowd packed at the foot of it, and one man at the top, straining and struggling to lift the trap door.
<p/>It was not to be stirred, however, and when the woman shouted up to unhook it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``It's already unhooked.
<p/>There's somebody sitting on it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And a moment later came a voice from downstairs: ``You might as well quit, you people.
<p/>So the crowd subsided; and a few moments later several policemen came up, staring here and there, and leering at their victims.
<p/>The women took it as a joke, as if they were used to it--though if they had been pale, one could not have told, for the paint on their cheeks.
<p/>One black-eyed young girl perched herself upon the top of the balustrade, and began to kick with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slippered foot at the helmets of the policemen, until one of them caught her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) by the ankle and pulled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) down.
<p/>On the floor below four or five other girls sat upon trunks in the hall, making fun of the procession which filed by them.
<p/>They were noisy and hilarious, and had evidently been drinking; one of them, who wore a bright red kimono, shouted and screamed in a voice that drowned out all the other sounds in the hall--and Jurgis took a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and then gave a start, and a cry, <div class="bookquote">``Marija!''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>We mean business, this time. '' Of the latter the men were for the most part frightened and sheepish-looking. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), and glanced around; then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shrank back and half sprang to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet in amazement.
<p/>'' Jurgis! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gasped. For a second or two they stood staring at each other. '' How did you come here?''
<p/>Marija exclaimed. '' I came to see you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) answered. <div class="bookquote">``When?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But how did you know--who told you I was here?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Alena Jasaityte. I met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jasaityte</b></font>) on the street. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Again there was a silence, while they gazed at each other. The rest of the crowd was watching them, and so Marija got up and came closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).
<p/>'' And you?'' Jurgis asked. '' You live here?'' '' Yes,'' said Marija, <div class="bookquote">``I live here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>Then suddenly came a hail from below:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Get your clothes on now, girls, and come along. You'd best begin, or you'll be sorry --it's raining outside.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Br-r-r! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>shivered some one, and the women got up and entered the various doors which lined the hallway.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>said Marija, and took Jurgis into her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) room, which was a tiny place about eight by six, with a cot and a chair and a dressing stand and some dresses hanging behind the door.
<p/>There were clothes scattered about on the floor, and hopeless confusion everywhere--boxes of rouge and bottles of perfume mixed with hats and soiled dishes on the dresser, and a pair of slippers and a clock and a whisky bottle on a chair.
<p/>Marija had nothing on but a kimono and a pair of stockings; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) proceeded to dress before Jurgis, and without even taking the trouble to close the door.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had by this time divined what sort of a place he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) was in; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had seen a great deal of the world since he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) had left home, and was not easy to shock--and yet it gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) a painful start that Marija should do this.
<p/>They had always been decent people at home, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) that the memory of old times ought to have ruled her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).
<p/>But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) laughed at himself for a fool. What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>), to be pretending to decency! '' How long have you been living here?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) asked. '' Nearly a year,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) answered. '' Why did you come?'' <div class="bookquote">``I had to live,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and I couldn't see the children starve.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) paused for a moment, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). '' You were out of work? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) asked, finally. '' I got sick,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``and after that I had no money.
<p/>And then Stanislovas died--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stanislovas dead!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>'' Yes,'' said Marija, <div class="bookquote">``I forgot. You didn't know about it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How did he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) die?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Rats killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) answered. Jurgis gave a gasp. '' Rats killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>)!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the other; she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) was bending over, lacing her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) shoes as she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) used to carry cans on a long pole; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>)'d drink a little out of each can, and one day he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) drank too much, and fell asleep in a corner, and got locked up in the place all night.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) was working in an oil factory--at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) was hired by the men to get their beer. When they found him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) the rats had killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) and eaten him (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) nearly all up.
<p/>'' Jurgis sat, frozen with horror. Marija went on lacing up her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) shoes. There was a long silence. Suddenly a big policeman came to the door.
<p/>'' Hurry up, there,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) said. '' As quick as I can,'' said Marija, and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) stood up and began putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) corsets with feverish haste.
<p/>'' Are the rest of the people alive? '' asked Jurgis, finally. '' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) said. '' Where are they?'' ''
<p/>They live not far from here. They're all right now. '' '' They are working? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) inquired. '' Elzbieta is,'' said Marija, <div class="bookquote">``when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) can.
<p/>I take care of them most of the time--I'm making plenty of money now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>Jurgis was silent for a moment.
<p/>'' Do they know you live here--how you live? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) asked. '' Elzbieta knows,'' answered Marija. '' I couldn't lie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>).
<p/>And maybe the children have found out by this time. It's nothing to be ashamed of--we can't help it.'' <div class="bookquote">``And Tamoszius?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) asked. '' Does he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) know? '' Marija shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) shoulders. '' How do I know? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) said. ''
<p/>I haven't seen him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) for over a year. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) got blood poisoning and lost one finger, and couldn't play the violin any more; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) went away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) could hardly believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was the same woman he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) had known in the old days; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was so quiet--so hard!
<p/>'' Marija was standing in front of the glass fastening her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) dress. Jurgis sat staring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>). It struck fear to his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) heart to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>).
<p/>Then suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) gave a glance at him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>). '' You look as if you had been having a rough time of it yourself,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I have,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) answered. '' I haven't a cent in my pockets, and nothing to do. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where have you been?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' All over. I've been hoboing it. Then I went back to the yards--just before the strike. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) paused for a moment, hesitating.
<p/>'' I asked for you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) added. '' I found you had gone away, no one knew where. Perhaps you think I did you a dirty trick running away as I did, Marija--
<p/>'' '' No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't blame you. We never have--any of us. You did your best--the job was too much for us.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) paused a moment, then added: <div class="bookquote">``We were too ignorant--that was the trouble. We didn't stand any chance. If I'd known what I know
<p/>now we'd have won out. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' You'd have come here?'' said Jurgis. '' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``but that's not what I meant.
<p/>I meant you--how differently you would have behaved--about Ona. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Jurgis was silent; he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) had never thought of that aspect of it.
<p/>When people are starving,'' the other continued, <div class="bookquote">``and they have anything with a price, they ought to sell it, I say.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>I guess you realize it now when it's too late. Ona could have taken care of us all, in the beginning.
<p/>'' Marija spoke without emotion, as one who had come to regard things from the business point of view. '' I--
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) did not add that he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) had paid three hundred dollars, and a foreman's job, for the satisfaction of knocking down
<p/>yes, I guess so,'' Jurgis answered hesitatingly. <div class="bookquote">``Phil''  (<font color='red'><b>Phil Connor</b></font>)</div>Connor a second time. The policeman came to the door again just then.
<p/>All right,'' said Marija, reaching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) hat, which was big enough to be a drum major's, and full of ostrich feathers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) went out into the hall and Jurgis followed, the policeman remaining to look under the bed and behind the door.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come on, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) said. '' Lively!'' '' '' What's going to come of this?'' Jurgis asked, as they started down the steps.
<p/>The madame's having some sort of time with the police; I don't know what it is, but maybe they'll come to terms before morning.
<p/>'' The raid, you mean? Oh, nothing--it happens to us every now and then. Anyhow, they won't do anything to you.
<p/>They always let the men off.'' '' Maybe so,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) responded, <div class="bookquote">``but not me-- I'm afraid I'm in for it. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I'm wanted by the police,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) said, lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) voice, though of course their conversation was in Lithuanian.
<p/>'' They'll send me up for a year or two, I'm afraid.'' <div class="bookquote">``Hell!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>said Marija. '' That's too bad. I'll see if I can't get you off.
<p/>Downstairs, where the greater part of the prisoners were now massed, she (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) sought out the stout personage with the diamond earrings, and had a few whispered words with her (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>).
<p/>'' The latter then approached the police sergeant who was in charge of the raid. '' Billy,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) said, pointing to Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``there's a fellow who came in to see his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sister.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)'d just got in the door when you knocked. You aren't taking hoboes, are you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>The sergeant laughed as he (<font color='blue'><b>sergeant</b></font>) looked at Jurgis.
<p/>So Jurgis slunk in among the rest of the men, who kept dodging behind each other like sheep that have smelled a wolf.
<p/>There were old men and young men, college boys and gray-beards old enough to be their grandfathers; some of them wore evening dress--there was no one among them save Jurgis who showed any signs of poverty.
<p/>'' Sorry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>wolf</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but the orders are every one but the servants. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>When the roundup was completed, the doors were opened and the party marched out.
<p/>Three patrol wagons were drawn up at the curb, and the whole neighborhood had turned out to see the sport; there was much chaffing, and a universal craning of necks.
<p/>The women stared about them with defiant eyes, or laughed and joked, while the men kept their heads bowed, and their hats pulled over their faces.
<p/>They were crowded into the patrol wagons as if into streetcars, and then off they went amid a din of cheers.
<p/>At the station house Jurgis gave a Polish name and was put into a cell with half a dozen others; and while these sat and talked in whispers, he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) lay down in a corner and gave himself up to his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) thoughts.
<p/>Yet when he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had thought of all humanity as vile and hideous, he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had somehow always excepted his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) own family that he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had loved; and now this sudden horrible discovery--Marija a whore, and Elzbieta and the children living off her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) shame!
<p/>Jurgis might argue with himself all he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) chose, that he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had done worse, and was a fool for caring--but still he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) could not get over the shock of that sudden unveiling, he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) could not help being sunk in grief because of it.
<p/>The depths of him (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) were troubled and shaken, memories were stirred in him (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) that had been sleeping so long he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had counted them dead.
<p/>Jurgis had looked into the deepest reaches of the social pit, and grown used to the sights in them. Memories of the old life--his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) old hopes and his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) old yearnings, his (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) old dreams of decency and independence!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) saw Ona again, he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ona</b></font>) gentle voice pleading with him (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) saw little Antanas, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had meant to make a man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) lived again through that day of horror when he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) had discovered Ona's shame--God, how he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had suffered, what a madman he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been!
<p/>How dreadful it had all seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and now, today, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had sat and listened, and half agreed when Marija told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been a fool!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) trembling old father, who had blessed them all with his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wonderful love. Yes--told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ought to have sold his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife's honor and lived by it!--And
<p/>The poor little fellow, with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) frostbitten fingers and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) terror of the snow--his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wailing voice rang in Jurgis's ears, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lay there in the darkness, until the sweat started on his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>Now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would quiver with a sudden spasm of horror, at the picture of little Stanislovas shut up in the deserted building and fighting for his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) life with the rats!
<p/>All these emotions had become strangers to the soul of Jurgis; it was so long since they had troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had ceased to think they might ever trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) again.
<p/>then there was Stanislovas and his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) awful fate--that brief story which Marija had narrated so calmly, with such dull indifference! Helpless, trapped, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was, what good did they do him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
<p/>It had been the task of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) recent life to fight them down, to crush them out of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); never in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) life would he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) have suffered from them again, save that they had caught him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) unawares, and overwhelmed him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could protect himself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) heard the old voices of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) saw its old ghosts beckoning to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), stretching out their arms to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)!
<p/>But they were far-off and shadowy, and the gulf between them was black and bottomless; they would fade away into the mists of the past once more.
<p/>Their voices would die, and never again would he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hear them--and so the last faint spark of manhood in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) soul would flicker out.
<p/>After breakfast Jurgis was driven to the court, which was crowded with the prisoners and those who had come out of curiosity or in the hope of recognizing one of the men and getting a case for blackmail.
<p/>The men were called up first, and reprimanded in a bunch, and then dismissed; but, Jurgis, to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) terror, was called separately, as being a suspicious-looking case.
<p/>It was in this very same court that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been tried, that time when his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) sentence had been <div class="bookquote">``suspended'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; it was the same judge, and the same clerk.
<p/>The latter now stared at Jurgis, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) half thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>); but the judge had no suspicions--just then his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) thoughts were upon a telephone message he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was expecting from a friend of the police captain of the district, telling what disposition he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) should make of the case of <div class="bookquote">``Polly''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Simpson, as the <div class="bookquote">``madame''  (<font color='red'><b>Polly Simpson</b></font>)</div>of the house was known.
<p/>Meantime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) listened to the story of how Jurgis had been looking for his (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) sister, and advised him (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) dryly to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) sister in a better place; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) let him (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) go, and proceeded to fine each of the girls five dollars, which fines were paid in a bunch from a wad of bills which Madame Polly extracted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) stocking.
<p/>The police had left the house, and already there were a few visitors; by evening the place would be running again, exactly as if nothing had happened.
<p/>--why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) ever have allowed them to torment him (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>)? Chapter 28 Jurgis waited outside and walked home with Marija. Meantime, Marija took Jurgis upstairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) room, and they sat and talked.
<p/>By daylight, Jurgis was able to observe that the color on her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) cheeks was not the old natural one of abounding health; her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) complexion was in reality a parchment yellow, and there were black rings under her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>'' Have you been sick? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Simpson</b></font>) asked. '' Sick? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) said. '' Hell!'' -LRB-Marija had learned to scatter her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) conversation with as many oaths as a longshoreman or a mule driver.-RRB-
<p/>'' How can I ever be anything but sick, at this life? '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) fell silent for a moment, staring ahead of her (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) gloomily.
<p/>'' It's morphine,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Polly</b></font>) said, at last. '' I seem to take more of it every day. '' '' What's that for?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) asked. '' It's the way of it; I don't know why. If it isn't that, it's drink. If the girls didn't booze they couldn't stand it any time at all.
<p/>And the madame always gives them dope when they first come, and they learn to like it; or else they take it for headaches and such things, and get the habit that way.
<p/>I've got it, I know ; I've tried to quit, but I never will while I'm here.'' <div class="bookquote">``How long are you going to stay?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) asked. '' I don't know,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) said. '' Always, I guess. What else could I do?'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't you save any money?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I get a half share, two dollars and a half for each customer, and sometimes I make twenty-five or thirty dollars a night, and
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Save!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Marija. '' Good Lord, no! I get enough, I suppose, but it all goes. you'd think I ought to save something out of that!
<p/>But then I am charged for my room and my meals--and such prices as you never heard of; and then for extras, and drinks--for everything I get, and some I don't.
<p/>My laundry bill is nearly twenty dollars each week alone--think of that! Yet what can I do? I either have to stand it or quit, and it would be the same anywhere else.
<p/>It's all I can do to save the fifteen dollars I give Elzbieta each week, so the children can go to school.
<p/>'' Marija sat brooding in silence for a while; then, seeing that Jurgis was interested, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">``That's the way they keep the girls--they let them run up debts, so they can't get away.
<p/>A young girl comes from abroad, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doesn't know a word of English, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gets into a place like this, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) wants to go the madame shows her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is a couple of hundred dollars in debt, and takes all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clothes away, and threatens to have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arrested if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) doesn't stay and do as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s told.
<p/>So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stays, and the longer she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stays, the more in debt she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gets. Often, too, they are girls that didn't know what they were coming to, that had hired out for housework.
<p/>Did you notice that little French girl with the yellow hair, that stood next to me in the court?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Jurgis answered in the affirmative.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a store clerk, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hired herself to a man to be sent here to work in a factory.
<p/>There were six of them, all together, and they were brought to a house just down the street from here, and this girl was put into a room alone, and they gave her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) some dope in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) food, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came to she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been ruined.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried, and screamed, and tore her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hair, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had nothing but a wrapper, and couldn't get away, and they kept her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) half insensible with drugs all the time, until she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave up.
<p/>'' Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came to America about a year ago. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never got outside of that place for ten months, and then they sent her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) away, because she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) didn't suit.
<p/>Only one of the girls that came out with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) got away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) jumped out of a second-story window one night.
<p/>I guess they'll put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out of here, too--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'s getting to have crazy fits, from drinking absinthe. There was a great fuss about that--maybe you heard of it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``I heard of it afterward. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>-LRB-It had happened in the place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Jurgis</b></font>) and Duane had taken refuge from their <div class="bookquote">``country customer.
<p/>There's lots of money in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Duane/Jack Duane/Jack</b></font>)</div>said Marija--<div class="bookquote">``they get as much as forty dollars a head for girls, and they bring them from all over.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>The girl had become insane, fortunately for the police.-RRB- '' There are seventeen in this place, and nine different countries among them.
<p/>In some places you might find even more. We have half a dozen French girls--I suppose it's because the madame speaks the language.
<p/>There's a place next door that's full of Japanese women, but I wouldn't live in the same house with one of them.
<p/>Marija paused for a moment or two, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``Most of the women here are pretty decent--you'd be surprised.
<p/>I used to think they did it because they liked to; but fancy a woman selling herself to every kind of man that comes, old or young, black or white--and doing it because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) likes to!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>French girls are bad, too, the worst of all, except for the Japanese. '' <div class="bookquote">``Some of them say they do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>said Jurgis.
<p/>'' I know,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``they say anything. They're in, and they know they can't get out. But they didn't like it when they began--
<p/>There's a little Jewish girl here who used to run errands for a milliner, and got sick and lost her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) place; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was four days on the streets without a mouthful of food, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went to a place just around the corner and offered herself, and they made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) give up her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clothes before they would give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a bite to eat!
<p/>you'd find out--it's always misery! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Marija sat for a minute or two, brooding somberly. <div class="bookquote">``Tell me about yourself, Jurgis,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, suddenly.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the long story of his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) adventures since his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flight from home; his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life as a tramp, and his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) work in the freight tunnels, and the accident; and then of Jack Duane, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) political career in the stockyards, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) downfall and subsequent failures.
<p/>Marija listened with sympathy; it was easy to believe the tale of his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) late starvation, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) face showed it all.
<p/>'' Where have you been? '' '' You found me just in the nick of time,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said. '' I'll stand by you--
<p/>I'll help you till you can get some work. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't like to let you--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) began. '' Why not?
<p/>Because I'm here?'' '' No, not that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Duane</b></font>) said. '' But I went off and left you-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Marija.
<p/>'' Don't think about it. I don't blame you.'' <div class="bookquote">``You must be hungry,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, after a minute or two. ''
<p/>You stay here to lunch--I'll have something up in the room. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) pressed a button, and a colored woman came to the door and took her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) order.
<p/>It's nice to have somebody to wait on you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) observed, with a laugh, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lay back on the bed.
<p/>As the prison breakfast had not been liberal, Jurgis had a good appetite, and they had a little feast together, talking meanwhile of Elzbieta and the children and old times.
<p/>Shortly before they were through, there came another colored girl, with the message that the <div class="bookquote">``madame''  (<font color='red'><b>another girl</b></font>)</div>wanted Marija--<div class="bookquote">``Lithuanian Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>as they called her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) here.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the new address of the family, a tenement over in the Ghetto district.
<p/>'' '' That means you have to go,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said to Jurgis. '' You go there,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said. '' They'll be glad to see you.
<p/>'' But Jurgis stood hesitating. '' I--I don't like to,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. '' Honest, Marija, why don't you just give me a little money and let me look for work first?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How do you need money? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reply. '' All you want is something to eat and a place to sleep, isn't it?''
<p/>Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but then I don't like to go there after I left them--and while I have nothing to do, and while you--you--''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>What are you talking?--I won't give you money,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) added, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to the door, <div class="bookquote">``because you'll drink it up, and do yourself harm.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go on!''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div>said Marija, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a push. '' Here's a quarter for you now, and go along, and they'll be so glad to have you back
<p/>, you won't have time to feel ashamed. Good-by! '' So Jurgis went out, and walked down the street to think it over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would first try to get work, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put in the rest of the day wandering here and there among factories and warehouses without success.
<p/>Then, when it was nearly dark, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) concluded to go home, and set out; but he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came to a restaurant, and went in and spent his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) quarter for a meal; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came out he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) changed his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind--the night was pleasant, and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would sleep somewhere outside, and put in the morrow hunting, and so have one more chance of a job.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) started away again, when suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) chanced to look about him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and found that he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was walking down the same street and past the same hall where he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had listened to the political speech the night before.
<p/>There was no red fire and no band now, but there was a sign out, announcing a meeting, and a stream of people pouring in through the entrance.
<p/>In a flash Jurgis had decided that he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would chance it once more, and sit down and rest while making up his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind what to do.
<p/>There were no decorations in the hall this time; but there was quite a crowd upon the platform, and almost every seat in the place was filled.
<p/>There was no one taking tickets, so it must be a free show again. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took one of the last, far in the rear, and straightway forgot all about his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) surroundings.
<p/>Would Elzbieta think that he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had come to sponge off her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), or would she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) meant to get to work again and do his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) share?
<p/>If only he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could get some sort of a job before he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went--if that last boss had only been willing to try him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)!
<p/>A tremendous roar had burst from the throats of the crowd, which by this time had packed the hall to the very doors.
<p/>Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) be decent to him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or would she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) scold him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)? --Then suddenly Jurgis looked up. Men and women were standing up, waving handkerchiefs, shouting, yelling.
<p/>Evidently the speaker had arrived, thought Jurgis; what fools they were making of themselves! What were they expecting to get out of it anyhow--what had they to do with elections, with governing the country?
<p/>Jurgis had been behind the scenes in politics. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) thoughts, but with one further fact to reckon with--that he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) was caught here.
<p/>The hall was now filled to the doors; and after the meeting it would be too late for him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) to go home, so he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) would have to make the best of it outside.
<p/>Perhaps it would be better to go home in the morning, anyway, for the children would be at school, and he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) and Elzbieta could have a quiet explanation.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) always had been a reasonable person; and he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) really did mean to do right. He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) would manage to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) of it--and besides, Marija was willing, and Marija was furnishing the money.
<p/>So Jurgis went on meditating; until finally, when he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had been an hour or two in the hall, there began to prepare itself a repetition of the dismal catastrophe of the night before.
<p/>Speaking had been going on all the time, and the audience was clapping its hands and shouting, thrilling with excitement; and little by little the sounds were beginning to blur in Jurgis's ears, and his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) thoughts were beginning to run together, and his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) head to wobble and nod.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) caught himself many times, as usual, and made desperate resolutions; but the hall was hot and close, and his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) long walk and is dinner were too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)--in the end his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) head sank forward and he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) went off again.
<p/>If Elzbieta were ugly, he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) that in so many words. And then again someone nudged him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) sat up with his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) old terrified start!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) eyes ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), with painful intensity, staring at the platform as if nothing else ever had interested him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), or ever could interest him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), all his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had been snoring again, of course! And now what? He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) imagined the angry exclamations, the hostile glances; he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) imagined the policeman striding toward him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)--reaching for his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Or was he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) to have one more chance? Were they going to let him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) alone this time? He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) sat trembling; waiting--
<p/>And then suddenly came a voice in his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) ear, a woman's voice, gentle and sweet, <div class="bookquote">``If you would try to listen, comrade, perhaps you would be interested.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>Jurgis was more startled by that than he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) would have been by the touch of a policeman. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) still kept his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) eyes fixed ahead, and did not stir; but his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) heart gave a great leap.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) waited long, long; and at last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was no longer watched, he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) stole a glance out of the corner of his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) eyes at the woman who sat beside him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>).
<p/>Comrade! Who was it that called him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``comrade'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>? She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was young and beautiful; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wore fine clothes, and was what is called a <div class="bookquote">``lady.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``comrade'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>! He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) turned a little, carefully, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) better; then he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) began to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), fascinated.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had apparently forgotten all about him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>), and was looking toward the platform. A man was speaking there--Jurgis heard his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice vaguely; but all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts were for this woman's face.
<p/>A feeling of alarm stole over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). It made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) flesh creep. What was the matter with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), what could be going on, to affect any one like that?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat as one turned to stone, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands clenched tightly in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lap, so tightly that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see the cords standing out in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wrists.
<p/>There was a look of excitement upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, of tense effort, as of one struggling mightily, or witnessing a struggle.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bosom rose and fell as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breathed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) excitement seemed to mount higher and higher, and then to sink away again, like a boat tossing upon ocean surges.
<p/>There was a faint quivering of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nostrils; and now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would moisten her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips with feverish haste. What was it?
<p/>What was the matter? It must be something that the man was saying, up there on the platform. What sort of a man was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
<p/>It was like coming suddenly upon some wild sight of nature--a mountain forest lashed by a tempest, a ship tossed about upon a stormy sea.
<p/>And what sort of thing was this, anyhow?--So all at once it occurred to Jurgis to look at the speaker. Jurgis had an unpleasant sensation, a sense of confusion, of disorder, of wild and meaningless uproar.
<p/>The man was tall and gaunt, as haggard as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) auditor himself; a thin black beard covered half of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, and one could see only two black hollows where the eyes were.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was speaking rapidly, in great excitement; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) used many gestures--as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) moved here and there upon the stage, reaching with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long arms as if to seize each person in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) audience.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice was deep, like an organ; it was some time, however, before Jurgis thought of the voice--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was too much occupied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes to think of what the man was saying.
<p/>But suddenly it seemed as if the speaker had begun pointing straight at him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had singled him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) out particularly for his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) remarks; and so Jurgis became suddenly aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) voice, trembling, vibrant with emotion, with pain and longing, with a burden of things unutterable, not to be compassed by words.
<p/>You listen to these things,'' the man was saying, <div class="bookquote">``and you say, `Yes, they are true, but they have been that way always.'
<p/>To hear it was to be suddenly arrested, to be gripped, transfixed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>Or you say, `Maybe it will come, but not in my time--it will not help me.'
<p/>And so you return to your daily round of toil, you go back to be ground up for profits in the world-wide mill of economic might!
<p/>To toil long hours for another's advantage; to live in mean and squalid homes, to work in dangerous and unhealthful places; to wrestle with the specters of hunger and privation, to take your chances of accident, disease, and death.
<p/>And each day the struggle becomes fiercer, the pace more cruel; each day you have to toil a little harder, and feel the iron hand of circumstance close upon you a little tighter.
<p/>Months pass, years maybe--and then you come again; and again I am here to plead with you, to know if want and misery have yet done their work with you, if injustice and oppression have yet opened your eyes!
<p/>There is no wilderness where I can hide from these things, there is no haven where I can escape them; though I travel to the ends of the earth, I find the same accursed system--I find that all the fair and noble impulses of humanity, the dreams of poets and the agonies of martyrs, are shackled and bound in the service of organized and predatory Greed!
<p/>, I cannot be silent; therefore I cast aside comfort and happiness, health and good repute--and go out into the world and cry out the pain of my spirit!
<p/>Therefore I am not to be silenced by poverty and sickness, not by hatred and obloquy, by threats and ridicule--not by prison and persecution, if they should come--not by any power that is upon the earth or above the earth, that was, or is, or ever can be created.
<p/>If I fail tonight, I can only try tomorrow; knowing that the fault must be mine--that if once the vision of my soul were spoken upon earth, if once the anguish of its defeat were uttered in human speech, it would break the stoutest barriers of prejudice, it would shake the most sluggish soul to action!
<p/>It would abash the most cynical, it would terrify the most selfish; and the voice of mockery would be silenced, and fraud and falsehood would slink back into their dens, and the truth would stand forth alone!
<p/>I shall still be waiting--there is nothing else that I can do. And therefore I cannot rest For I speak with the voice of the millions who are voiceless!
<p/>Of the disinherited of life, for whom there is no respite and no deliverance, to whom the world is a prison, a dungeon of torture, a tomb!
<p/>With the voice of the little child who toils tonight in a Southern cotton mill, staggering with exhaustion, numb with agony, and knowing no hope but the grave!
<p/>Of the mother who sews by candlelight in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tenement garret, weary and weeping, smitten with the mortal hunger of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) babes!
<p/>Of the man who lies upon a bed of rags, wrestling in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last sickness and leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved ones to perish!
<p/>Of the young girl who, somewhere at this moment, is walking the streets of this horrible city, beaten and starving, and making her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) choice between the brothel and the lake!
<p/>With the voice of those, whoever and wherever they may be, who are caught beneath the wheels of the Juggernaut of Greed!
<p/>Of the everlasting soul of Man, arising from the dust; breaking its way out of its prison--rending the bands of oppression and ignorance--groping its way to the light!''
<p/>There was an instant of silence, while men caught their breaths, and then like a single sound there came a cry from a thousand people.
<p/>Through it all Jurgis sat still, motionless and rigid, his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) eyes fixed upon the speaker; he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was trembling, smitten with wonder.
<p/>Of them that are oppressed and have no comforter! With the voice of humanity, calling for deliverance! The speaker paused. Suddenly the man raised his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands, and silence fell, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began again.
<p/>I plead with you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``whoever you may be, provided that you care about the truth; but most of all I plead with working-man, with those to whom the evils I portray are not mere matters of sentiment, to be dallied and toyed with, and then perhaps put aside and forgotten--to whom they are the grim and relentless realities of the daily grind, the chains upon their limbs, the lash upon their backs, the iron in their souls.
<p/>To you, whose lot it is to sow that others may reap, to labor and obey, and ask no more than the wages of a beast of burden, the food and shelter to keep you alive from day to day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>To you, working-men! To you, the toilers, who have made this land, and have no voice in its councils! It is to you that I come with my message of salvation, it is to you that I appeal.
<p/>I know how much it is to ask of you--I know, for I have been in your place, I have lived your life, and there is no man before me here tonight who knows it better.
<p/>I have known what it is to be a street-waif, a bootblack, living upon a crust of bread and sleeping in cellar stairways and under empty wagons.
<p/>I have known what it is to dare and to aspire, to dream mighty dreams and to see them perish--to see all the fair flowers of my spirit trampled into the mire by the wild-beast powers of my life.
<p/>I know what is the price that a working-man pays for knowledge--I have paid for it with food and sleep, with agony of body and mind, with health, almost with life itself; and so, when I come to you with a story of hope and freedom, with the vision of a new earth to be created, of a new labor to be dared, I am not surprised that I find you sordid and material, sluggish and incredulous.
<p/>That I do not despair is because I know also the forces that are driving behind you--because I know the raging lash of poverty, the sting of contempt and mastership, `the insolence of office and the spurns.'
<p/>Because I feel sure that in the crowd that has come to me tonight, no matter how many may be dull and heedless, no matter how many may have come out of idle curiosity, or in order to ridicule--there will be some one man whom pain and suffering have made desperate, whom some chance vision of wrong and horror has startled and shocked into attention.
<p/>And to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) my words will come like a sudden flash of lightning to one who travels in darkness--revealing the way before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), the perils and the obstacles--solving all problems, making all difficulties clear!
<p/>The scales will fall from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes, the shackles will be torn from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) limbs--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will leap up with a cry of thankfulness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will stride forth a free man at last!
<p/>A man who will never more be trapped--whom no blandishments will cajole, whom no threats will frighten; who from tonight on will move forward, and not backward, who will study and understand, who will gird on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sword and take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) place in the army of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comrades and brothers.
<p/>Who will carry the good tidings to others, as I have carried them to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--priceless gift of liberty and light that is neither mine nor his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but is the heritage of the soul of man!
<p/>You have lived so long in the toil and heat that your senses are dulled, your souls are numbed; but realize once in your lives this world in which you dwell--tear off the rags of its customs and conventions--behold it as it is, in all its hideous nakedness!
<p/>Realize that out upon the plains of Manchuria tonight two hostile armies are facing each other--that now, while we are seated here, a million human beings may be hurled at each other's throats, striving with the fury of maniacs to tear each other to pieces!
<p/>A man delivered from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) self-created slavery! Working-men, working-men--comrades! open your eyes and look about you! Realize it, realize it! And this in the twentieth century, nineteen hundred years since the Prince of Peace was born on earth!
<p/>Nineteen hundred years that his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) words have been preached as divine, and here two armies of men are rending and tearing each other like the wild beasts of the forest!
<p/>We have schools and colleges, newspapers and books; we have searched the heavens and the earth, we have weighed and probed and reasoned--and all to equip men to destroy each other!
<p/>We call it War, and pass it by--but do not put me off with platitudes and conventions--come with me, come with me--realize it!
<p/>Philosophers have reasoned, prophets have denounced, poets have wept and pleaded--and still this hideous Monster roams at large! See the bodies of men pierced by bullets, blown into pieces by bursting shells!
<p/>Hear the crunching of the bayonet, plunged into human flesh; hear the groans and shrieks of agony, see the faces of men crazed by pain, turned into fiends by fury and hate!
<p/>Put your hand upon that piece of flesh--it is hot and quivering--just now it was a part of a man! This blood is still steaming--it was driven by a human heart!
<p/>And we know it, and read of it, and take it for granted; our papers tell of it, and the presses are not stopped--our churches know of it, and do not close their doors--the people behold it, and do not rise up in horror and revolution!
<p/>Almighty God! and this goes on--it is systematic, organized, premeditated! '' Or perhaps Manchuria is too far away for you--come home with me then, come here to Chicago.
<p/>Here in this city to-night ten thousand women are shut up in foul pens, and driven by hunger to sell their bodies to live.
<p/>And these women are made in the image of your mothers, they may be your sisters, your daughters; the child whom you left at home tonight, whose laughing eyes will greet you in the morning--that fate may be waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>women</b></font>)!
<p/>To-night in Chicago there are ten thousand men, homeless and wretched, willing to work and begging for a chance, yet starving, and fronting in terror the awful winter cold!
<p/>Tonight in Chicago there are a hundred thousand children wearing out their strength and blasting their lives in the effort to earn their bread!
<p/>There are a hundred thousand mothers who are living in misery and squalor, struggling to earn enough to feed their little ones!
<p/>And we know it, we make it a jest! There are a hundred thousand old people, cast off and helpless, waiting for death to take them from their torments!
<p/>There are a million people, men and women and children, who share the curse of the wage-slave; who toil every hour they can stand and see, for just enough to keep them alive; who are condemned till the end of their days to monotony and weariness, to hunger and misery, to heat and cold, to dirt and disease, to ignorance and drunkenness and vice!
<p/>And then turn over the page with me, and gaze upon the other side of the picture. There are a thousand--ten thousand, maybe--who are the masters of these slaves, who own their toil.
<p/>They do nothing to earn what they receive, they do not even have to ask for it--it comes to them of itself, their only care is to dispose of it.
<p/>They live in palaces, they riot in luxury and extravagance--such as no words can describe, as makes the imagination reel and stagger, makes the soul grow sick and faint.
<p/>They spend hundreds of dollars for a pair of shoes, a handkerchief, a garter; they spend millions for horses and automobiles and yachts, for palaces and banquets, for little shiny stones with which to deck their bodies.
<p/>Their life is a contest among themselves for supremacy in ostentation and recklessness, in the destroying of useful and necessary things, in the wasting of the labor and the lives of their fellow creatures, the toil and anguish of the nations, the sweat and tears and blood of the human race!
<p/>It is all theirs--it comes to them; just as all the springs pour into streamlets, and the streamlets into rivers, and the rivers into the oceans--so, automatically and inevitably, all the wealth of society comes to them.
<p/>The farmer tills the soil, the miner digs in the earth, the weaver tends the loom, the mason carves the stone; the clever man invents, the shrewd man directs, the wise man studies, the inspired man sings--and all the result, the products of the labor of brain and muscle, are gathered into one stupendous stream and poured into their laps!
<p/>The whole of society is in their grip, the whole labor of the world lies at their mercy--and like fierce wolves they rend and destroy, like ravening vultures they devour and tear!
<p/>The whole power of mankind belongs to them, forever and beyond recall--do what it can, strive as it will, humanity lives for them and dies for them!
<p/>They own not merely the labor of society, they have bought the governments; and everywhere they use their raped and stolen power to intrench themselves in their privileges, to dig wider and deeper the channels through which the river of profits flows to
<p/>You have been brought up to it, you plod on like beasts of burden, thinking only of the day and its pain--yet is there a man among you who can believe that such a system will continue forever--is there a man here in this audience tonight so hardened and debased that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dare rise up before me and say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believes it can continue forever; that the product of the labor of society, the means of existence of the human race, will always belong to idlers and parasites, to be spent for the gratification of vanity and lust--to be spent for any purpose whatever, to be at the disposal of any individual will whatever--that somehow, somewhere, the labor of humanity will not belong to humanity, to be used for the purposes of humanity, to be controlled by the will of humanity?
<p/>them!--And you, workingmen, workingmen! And if this is ever to be, how is it to be--what power is there that will bring it about?
<p/>Will they forge you the sword of your deliverance, will they marshal you the army and lead it to the fray?
<p/>Will their wealth be spent for the purpose--will they build colleges and churches to teach you, will they print papers to herald your progress, and organize political parties to guide and carry on the struggle?
<p/>Will it be the task of your masters , do you think--will they write the charter of your liberties? Can you not see that the task is your task--yours to dream, yours to resolve, yours to execute?
<p/>That if ever it is carried out, it will be in the face of every obstacle that wealth and mastership can oppose--in the face of ridicule and slander, of hatred and persecution, of the bludgeon and the jail?
<p/>That it will be by the power of your naked bosoms, opposed to the rage of oppression! By the grim and bitter teaching of blind and merciless affliction!
<p/>By the sad and lonely hunger of the spirit; by seeking and striving and yearning, by heartache and despairing, by agony and sweat of blood!
<p/>It will be by money paid for with hunger, by knowledge stolen from sleep, by thoughts communicated under the shadow of the gallows!
<p/>It will be a movement beginning in the far-off past, a thing obscure and unhonored, a thing easy to ridicule, easy to despise; a thing unlovely, wearing the aspect of vengeance and hate--but to you, the working-man, the wage-slave, calling with a voice insistent, imperious--with a voice that you cannot escape, wherever upon the earth you may be!
<p/>With the voice of all your wrongs, with the voice of all your desires; with the voice of your duty and your hope--of everything in the world that is worth while to you!
<p/>By the painful gropings of the untutored mind, by the feeble stammerings of the uncultured voice! The voice of the poor, demanding that poverty shall cease!
<p/>The voice of power, wrought out of suffering--of resolution, crushed out of weakness--of joy and courage, born in the bottomless pit of anguish and despair!
<p/>The voice of Labor, despised and outraged; a mighty giant, lying prostrate--mountainous, colossal, but blinded, bound, and ignorant of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) strength.
<p/>And now a dream of resistance haunts him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), hope battling with fear; until suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stirs, and a fetter snaps--and a thrill shoots through him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), to the farthest ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) huge body, and in a flash the dream becomes an act!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) starts, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lifts himself; and the bands are shattered, the burdens roll off him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) rises--towering, gigantic; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) springs to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) feet, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) shouts in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) newborn exultation--
<p/>'' And the speaker's voice broke suddenly, with the stress of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) feelings; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) arms stretched out above him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and the power of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) vision seemed to lift him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) from the floor.
<p/>The voice of the oppressed, pronouncing the doom of oppression! The audience came to its feet with a yell; men waved their arms, laughing aloud in their excitement.
<p/>And Jurgis was with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was shouting to tear his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) throat; shouting because he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could not help it, because the stress of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) feeling was more than he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could bear.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) presence, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) voice: a voice with strange intonations that rang through the chambers of the soul like the clanging of a bell--that gripped the listener like a mighty hand about his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) body, that shook him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) and startled him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) with sudden fright, with a sense of things not of earth, of mysteries never spoken before, of presences of awe and terror!
<p/>There was an unfolding of vistas before him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>), a breaking of the ground beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>), an upheaving, a stirring, a trembling; he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) felt himself suddenly a mere man no longer--there were powers within him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) undreamed of, there were demon forces contending, age-long wonders struggling to be born; and he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) sat oppressed with pain and joy, while a tingling stole down into his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) finger tips, and his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) breath came hard and fast.
<p/>The sentences of this man were to Jurgis like the crashing of thunder in his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) soul; a flood of emotions surged up in him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>)--all his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) old hopes and longings, his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) old griefs and rages and despairs.
<p/>All that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) had ever felt in his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) whole life seemed to come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) at once, and with one new emotion, hardly to be described.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) should have suffered such oppressions and such horrors was bad enough; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) should have been crushed and beaten by them, that he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) should have submitted, and forgotten, and lived in peace--ah, truly that was a thing not to be put into words, a thing not to be borne by a human creature, a thing of terror and madness!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What,''  (<font color='red'><b>the prophet</b></font>)</div>asks the prophet, <div class="bookquote">``is the murder of them that kill the body, to the murder of them that kill the soul?
<p/>And Jurgis was a man whose soul had been murdered, who had ceased to hope and to struggle--who had made terms with degradation and despair; and now, suddenly, in one awful convulsion, the black and hideous fact was made plain to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!
<p/>There was a falling in of all the pillars of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, the sky seemed to split above him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood there, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clenched hands upraised, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes bloodshot, and the veins standing out purple in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face, roaring in the voice of a wild beast, frantic, incoherent, maniacal.
<p/>It was not merely the man's words, the torrent of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eloquence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the prophet</b></font>)</div>And when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could shout no more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) still stood there, gasping, and whispering hoarsely to himself:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``By God! By God! By God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Chapter 29 The man had gone back to a seat upon the platform, and Jurgis realized that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speech was over.
<p/>The applause continued for several minutes; and then some one started a song, and the crowd took it up, and the place shook with it.
<p/>Jurgis had never heard it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not make out the words, but the wild and wonderful spirit of it seized upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--
<p/>it was the <div class="bookquote">``Marseillaise!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>As stanza after stanza of it thundered forth, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands clasped, trembling in every nerve.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not think at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was stunned; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that in the mighty upheaval that had taken place in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, a new man had been born.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been torn out of the jaws of destruction, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been delivered from the thraldom of despair; the whole world had been changed for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was free, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was free!
<p/>Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were to suffer as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had before, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were to beg and starve, nothing would be the same to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would understand it, and bear it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would no longer be the sport of circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be a man, with a will and a purpose; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have something to fight for, something to die for, if need be!
<p/>Here were men who would show him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have friends and allies, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would dwell in the sight of justice, and walk arm in arm with power.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been so stirred in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life--it was a miracle that had been wrought in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). The audience subsided again, and Jurgis sat back.
<p/>The chairman of the meeting came forward and began to speak. His (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) voice sounded thin and futile after the other's, and to Jurgis it seemed a profanation.
<p/>The chairman was explaining that a collection would now be taken up to defray the expenses of the meeting, and for the benefit of the campaign fund of the party.
<p/>Why should any one else speak, after that miraculous man--why should they not all sit in silence? Jurgis heard; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not a penny to give, and so his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts went elsewhere again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes fixed on the orator, who sat in an armchair, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attitude indicating exhaustion.
<p/>But suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood up again, and Jurgis heard the chairman of the meeting saying that the speaker would now answer any questions which the audience might care to put to him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>).
<p/>The man came forward, and some one--a woman--arose and asked about some opinion the speaker had expressed concerning Tolstoy. Jurgis had never heard of Tolstoy, and did not care anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>).
<p/>The thing was not to talk, but to do; the thing was to get bold of others and rouse them, to organize them and prepare for the fight!
<p/>Why should any one want to ask such questions, after an address like that? But still the discussion went on, in ordinary conversational tones, and it brought Jurgis back to the everyday world.
<p/>A few minutes ago he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) had felt like seizing the hand of the beautiful lady by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) side, and kissing it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) had felt like flinging his (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) arms about the neck of the man on the other side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>).
<p/>And now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) began to realize again that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``hobo,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) was ragged and dirty, and smelled bad, and had no place to sleep that night!
<p/>And so, at last, when the meeting broke up, and the audience started to leave, poor Jurgis was in an agony of uncertainty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) had not thought of leaving--he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) had thought that the vision must last forever, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) had found comrades and brothers.
<p/>But now he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) would go out, and the thing would fade away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) would never be able to find it again!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) seat, frightened and wondering; but others in the same row wanted to get out, and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) had to stand up and move along.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) was swept down the aisle he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) looked from one person to another, wistfully; they were all excitedly discussing the address--but there was nobody who offered to discuss it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) knew nothing at all about that speech he (<font color='blue'><b>Tolstoy</b></font>) had heard, not even the name of the orator; and he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was to go away--no,
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was near enough to the door to feel the night air, when desperation seized him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>). no, it was preposterous, he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) must speak to some one; he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) must find that man himself and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>).
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) stepped into an empty row of seats and watched, and when the crowd had thinned out, he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) started toward the platform.
<p/>The speaker was gone; but there was a stage door that stood open, with people passing in and out, and no one on guard.
<p/>Jurgis summoned up his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) courage and went in, and down a hallway, and to the door of a room where many people were crowded.
<p/>No one paid any attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) pushed in, and in a corner he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) saw the man he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) sought.
<p/>The orator sat in a chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) shoulders sunk together and his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) eyes half closed; his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) face was ghastly pale, almost greenish in hue, and one arm lay limp at his (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) side.
<p/>A big man with spectacles on stood near him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>), and kept pushing back the crowd, saying, <div class="bookquote">``Stand away a little, please; can't you see the comrade is worn out?
<p/>Now and then the man would look up, and address a word or two to those who were near him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and, at last, on one of these occasions, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) glance rested on Jurgis.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not despise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), tramp as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was! ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>So Jurgis stood watching, while five or ten minutes passed. There seemed to be a slight hint of inquiry about it, and a sudden impulse seized the other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stepped forward. '' I wanted to thank you, sir!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began, in breathless haste. '' I could not go away without telling you how much--how glad I am I heard you.
<p/>I --I didn't know anything about it all-- '' The big man with the spectacles, who had moved away, came back at this moment.
<p/>'' The comrade is too tired to talk to any one--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) began; but the other held up his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) hand. ''
<p/>Wait,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) said. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) has something to say to me. '' And then he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) looked into Jurgis's face. '' You want to know more about Socialism?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) asked.
<p/>Jurgis started. '' I-- I--'' he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) stammered. <div class="bookquote">``Is it Socialism? I didn't know. I want to know about what you spoke of--I want to help.
<p/>I have been through all that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where do you live?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>asked the other. '' I have no home,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``I am out of work.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>'' You are a foreigner, are you not?'' <div class="bookquote">``Lithuanian, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div>The man thought for a moment, and then turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend.
<p/>'' Who is there, Walters? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Walters</b></font>) asked. '' There is Ostrinski--but he (<font color='blue'><b>Walters</b></font>) is a Pole-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Ostrinski speaks Lithuanian,''  (<font color='red'><b>a Pole</b></font>)</div>said the other.
<p/>'' All right, then; would you mind seeing if he (<font color='blue'><b>Walters</b></font>) has gone yet? '' The other started away, and the speaker looked at Jurgis again.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) had deep, black eyes, and a face full of gentleness and pain. '' You must excuse me, comrade,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' I am just tired out--I have spoken every day for the last month. I will introduce you to some one who will be able to help you as well as I could--
<p/>The messenger had had to go no further than the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) came back, followed by a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) introduced to Jurgis as <div class="bookquote">``Comrade Ostrinski.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>'' Comrade Ostrinski was a little man, scarcely up to Jurgis's shoulder, wizened and wrinkled, very ugly, and slightly lame.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had on a long-tailed black coat, worn green at the seams and the buttonholes; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes must have been weak, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wore green spectacles that gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a grotesque appearance.
<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handclasp was hearty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke in Lithuanian, which warmed Jurgis to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' You want to know about Socialism?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. '' Surely. Let us go out and take a stroll, where we can be quiet and talk some.
<p/>Ostrinski asked where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lived, offering to walk in that direction; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had to explain once more that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was without a home.
<p/>At the other's request he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story; how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come to America, and what had happened to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the stockyards, and how his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) family had been broken up, and how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had become a wanderer.
<p/>'' And so Jurgis bade farewell to the master wizard, and went out. So much the little man heard, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pressed Jurgis's arm tightly.
<p/>'' You have been through the mill, comrade! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) said. '' We will make a fighter out of you!'' Then Ostrinski in turn explained his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) circumstances.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) would have asked Jurgis to his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) home--but he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) had only two rooms, and had no bed to offer. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) would have given up his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) own bed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) wife was ill.
<p/>Later on, when he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) understood that otherwise Jurgis would have to sleep in a hallway, he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) offered him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) kitchen floor, a chance which the other was only too glad to accept.
<p/>'' Perhaps tomorrow we can do better,'' said Ostrinski. '' We try not to let a comrade starve. '' Ostrinski's home was in the Ghetto district, where he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) had two rooms in the basement of a tenement.
<p/>There was a baby crying as they entered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) closed the door leading into the bedroom. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) had three young children, he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) explained, and a baby had just come.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) drew up two chairs near the kitchen stove, adding that Jurgis must excuse the disorder of the place, since at such a time one's domestic arrangements were upset.
<p/>Half of the kitchen was given up to a workbench, which was piled with clothing, and Ostrinski explained that he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) was a <div class="bookquote">``pants finisher.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) brought great bundles of clothing here to his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) home, where he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) wife worked on them. He (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) made a living at it, but it was getting harder all the time, because his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) eyes were failing.
<p/>What would come when they gave out he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) could not tell; there had been no saving anything--a man could barely keep alive by twelve or fourteen hours' work a day.
<p/>The finishing of pants did not take much skill, and anybody could learn it, and so the pay was forever getting less.
<p/>That was the competitive wage system; and if Jurgis wanted to understand what Socialism was, it was there he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had best begin.
<p/>The workers were dependent upon a job to exist from day to day, and so they bid against each other, and no man could get more than the lowest man would consent to work for.
<p/>That was <div class="bookquote">``competition,''  (<font color='red'><b>the wage-earner</b></font>)</div>so far as it concerned the wage-earner, the man who had only his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) labor to sell; to those on top, the exploiters, it appeared very differently, of course--there were few of them, and they could combine and dominate, and their power would be unbreakable.
<p/>And so all over the world two classes were forming, with an unbridged chasm between them--the capitalist class, with its enormous fortunes, and the proletariat, bound into slavery by unseen chains.
<p/>The latter were a thousand to one in numbers, but they were ignorant and helpless, and they would remain at the mercy of their exploiters until they were organized--until they had become ``class-conscious.
<p/>It was a slow and weary process, but it would go on--it was like the movement of a glacier, once it was started it could never be stopped.
<p/>Every Socialist did his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) share, and lived upon the vision of the <div class="bookquote">``good time coming,'' (<font color='red'><b>Every Socialist</b></font>)</div>--when the working class should go to the polls and seize the powers of government, and put an end to private property in the means of production.
<p/>No matter how poor a man was, or how much he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suffered, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could never be really unhappy while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew of that future; even if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not live to see it himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) children would, and, to a Socialist, the victory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) class was his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) victory.
<p/>Also he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had always the progress to encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>); here in Chicago, for instance, the movement was growing by leaps and bounds.
<p/>Chicago was the industrial center of the country, and nowhere else were the unions so strong; but their organizations did the workers little good, for the employers were organized, also; and so the strikes generally failed, and as fast as the unions were broken up the men were coming over to the Socialists.
<p/>And thus the mass of the people were always in a life-and-death struggle with poverty. '' Ostrinski explained the organization of the party, the machinery by which the proletariat was educating itself.
<p/>There were <div class="bookquote">``locals''  (<font color='red'><b>a members</b></font>)</div>in every big city and town, and they were being organized rapidly in the smaller places; a local had anywhere from six to a thousand members, and there were fourteen hundred of them in all, with a total of about twenty-five thousand members, who paid dues to support the organization.
<p/>Local Cook County,'' as the city organization was called, had eighty branch locals, and it alone was spending several thousand dollars in the campaign.
<p/>It published a weekly in English, and one each in Bohemian and German; also there was a monthly published in Chicago, and a cooperative publishing house, that issued a million and a half of Socialist books and pamphlets every year.
<p/>All this was the growth of the last few years--there had been almost nothing of it when Ostrinski first came to Chicago.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had lived in Silesia, a member of a despised and persecuted race, and had taken part in the proletarian movement in the early seventies, when Bismarck, having conquered France, had turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) policy of blood and iron upon the <div class="bookquote">``International.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Bismarck</b></font>)</div>Ostrinski was a Pole, about fifty years of age. '' Ostrinski himself had twice been in jail, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had been young then, and had not cared.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had had more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) share of the fight, though, for just when Socialism had broken all its barriers and become the great political force of the empire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had come to America, and begun all over again.
<p/>In America every one had laughed at the mere idea of Socialism then--in America all men were free. As if political liberty made wage slavery any the more tolerable! said Ostrinski.
<p/>The little tailor sat tilted back in his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) stiff kitchen chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) feet stretched out upon the empty stove, and speaking in low whispers, so as not to waken those in the next room.
<p/>To Jurgis he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) seemed a scarcely less wonderful person than the speaker at the meeting; he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) was poor, the lowest of the low, hunger-driven and miserable--and yet how much he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) knew, how much he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) had dared and achieved, what a hero he (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) had been!
<p/>There were others like him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>), too--thousands like him (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>), and all of them workingmen! That all this wonderful machinery of progress had been created by his (<font color='blue'><b>tailor</b></font>) fellows--
<p/>Jurgis could not believe it, it seemed too good to be true. That was always the way, said Ostrinski; when a man was first converted to Socialism
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was like a crazy person--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not understand how others could fail to see it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expected to convert all the world the first week.
<p/>After a while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would realize how hard a task it was; and then it would be fortunate that other new hands kept coming, to save him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from settling down into a rut.
<p/>Just now Jurgis would have plenty of chance to vent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) excitement, for a presidential campaign was on, and everybody was talking politics.
<p/>Ostrinski would take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to the next meeting of the branch local, and introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might join the party.
<p/>The dues were five cents a week, but any one who could not afford this might be excused from paying. The Socialist party was a really democratic political organization--it was controlled absolutely by its own membership, and had no bosses.
<p/>You might say that there was really but one Socialist principle--that of <div class="bookquote">``no compromise,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which was the essence of the proletarian movement all over the world.
<p/>When a Socialist was elected to office he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) voted with old party legislators for any measure that was likely to be of help to the working class, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) never forgot that these concessions, whatever they might be, were trifles compared with the great purpose--the organizing of the working class for the revolution.
<p/>So far, the rule in America had been that one Socialist made another Socialist once every two years; and if they should maintain the same rate they would carry the country in 1912--though not all of them expected to succeed as quickly as that.
<p/>The Socialists were organized in every civilized nation; it was an international political party, said Ostrinski, the greatest the world had ever known.
<p/>All of these things Ostrinski explained, as also the principles of the party. It numbered thirty million of adherents, and it cast eight million votes.
<p/>It had started its first newspaper in Japan, and elected its first deputy in Argentina; in France it named members of cabinets, and in Italy and Australia it held the balance of power and turned out ministries.
<p/>In Germany, where its vote was more than a third of the total vote of the empire, all other parties and powers had united to fight it.
<p/>It would not do, Ostrinski explained, for the proletariat of one nation to achieve the victory, for that nation would be crushed by the military power of the others; and so the Socialist movement was a world movement, an organization of all mankind to establish liberty and fraternity.
<p/>It was the new religion of humanity--or you might say it was the fulfillment of the old religion, since it implied but the literal application of all the teachings of Christ.
<p/>Until long after midnight Jurgis sat lost in the conversation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) new acquaintance. It was a most wonderful experience to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>)--an almost supernatural experience.
<p/>It was like encountering an inhabitant of the fourth dimension of space, a being who was free from all one's own limitations.
<p/>For four years, now, Jurgis had been wondering and blundering in the depths of a wilderness; and here, suddenly, a hand reached down and seized him (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>), and lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) out of it, and set him (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) upon a mountain-top, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) could survey it all--could see the paths from which he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) had wandered, the morasses into which he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) had stumbled, the hiding places of the beasts of prey that had fallen upon him (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>).
<p/>There were his (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) Packingtown experiences, for instance --what was there about Packingtown that Ostrinski could not explain! To Jurgis the packers had been equivalent to fate; Ostrinski showed him (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) that they were the Beef Trust.
<p/>They were a gigantic combination of capital, which had crushed all opposition, and overthrown the laws of the land, and was preying upon the people.
<p/>Jurgis recollected how, when he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) had first come to Packingtown, he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) had stood and watched the hog-killing, and thought how cruel and savage it was, and come away congratulating himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) was not a hog; now his (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) new acquaintance showed him (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) that a hog was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) had been--one of the packers' hogs.
<p/>What they wanted from a hog was all the profits that could be got out of him (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>); and that was what they wanted from the workingman, and also that was what they wanted from the public.
<p/>What the hog thought of it, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) suffered, were not considered; and no more was it with labor, and no more with the purchaser of meat.
<p/>That was true everywhere in the world, but it was especially true in Packingtown; there seemed to be something about the work of slaughtering that tended to ruthlessness and ferocity--it was literally the fact that in the methods of the packers a hundred human lives did not balance a penny of profit.
<p/>When Jurgis had made himself familiar with the Socialist literature, as he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) would very quickly, he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) would get glimpses of the Beef Trust from all sorts of aspects, and he (<font color='blue'><b>inhabitant</b></font>) would find it everywhere the same; it was the incarnation of blind and insensate Greed.
<p/>It was a monster devouring with a thousand mouths, trampling with a thousand hoofs; it was the Great Butcher--it was the spirit of Capitalism made flesh.
<p/>Upon the ocean of commerce it sailed as a pirate ship; it had hoisted the black flag and declared war upon civilization.
<p/>In Chicago the city government was simply one of its branch offices; it stole billions of gallons of city water openly, it dictated to the courts the sentences of disorderly strikers, it forbade the mayor to enforce the building laws against it.
<p/>In the national capital it had power to prevent inspection of its product, and to falsify government reports; it violated the rebate laws, and when an investigation was threatened it burned its books and sent its criminal agents out of the country.
<p/>In the commercial world it was a Juggernaut car; it wiped out thousands of businesses every year, it drove men to madness and suicide.
<p/>It had forced the price of cattle so low as to destroy the stock-raising industry, an occupation upon which whole states existed; it had ruined thousands of butchers who had refused to handle its products.
<p/>It divided the country into districts, and fixed the price of meat in all of them; and it owned all the refrigerator cars, and levied an enormous tribute upon all poultry and eggs and fruit and vegetables.
<p/>With the millions of dollars a week that poured in upon it, it was reaching out for the control of other interests, railroads and trolley lines, gas and electric light franchises--it already owned the leather and the grain business of the country.
<p/>The people were tremendously stirred up over its encroachments, but nobody had any remedy to suggest; it was the task of Socialists to teach and organize them, and prepare them for the time when they were to seize the huge machine called the Beef Trust, and use it to produce food for human beings and not to heap up fortunes for a band of pirates.
<p/>It was long after midnight when Jurgis lay down upon the floor of Ostrinski's kitchen; and yet it was an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) could get to sleep, for the glory of that joyful vision of the people of Packingtown marching in and taking possession of the Union Stockyards!
<p/>Bribery and corruption were its everyday methods. Chapter 30 Jurgis had breakfast with Ostrinski and his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) family, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) went home to Elzbieta.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was no longer shy about it--when he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) went in, instead of saying all the things he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had been planning to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) started to tell Elzbieta about the revolution!
<p/>At first she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was out of his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) mind, and it was hours before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) could really feel certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was himself.
<p/>When, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had satisfied herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was sane upon all subjects except politics, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) troubled herself no further about it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) soul had been baked hard in the fire of adversity, and there was no altering it now; life to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) was the hunt for daily bread, and ideas existed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) only as they bore upon that.
<p/>All that interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) in regard to this new frenzy which had seized hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) son-in-law was whether or not it had a tendency to make him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) sober and industrious; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) intended to look for work and to contribute his (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) share to the family fund, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>son-in-law</b></font>) full rein to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) of anything.
<p/>A wonderfully wise little woman was Elzbieta; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) could think as quickly as a hunted rabbit, and in half an hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) had chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) life-attitude to the Socialist movement.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) agreed in everything with Jurgis, except the need of his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) dues; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) would even go to a meeting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) now and then, and sit and plan her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) next day's dinner amid the storm.
<p/>For a week after he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) became a convert Jurgis continued to wander about all day, looking for work; until at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) met with a strange fortune.
<p/>Jurgis was destined to find that Elzbieta's armor was absolutely impervious to Socialism. He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) was passing one of Chicago's innumerable small hotels, and after some hesitation he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) concluded to go in.
<p/>A man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took for the proprietor was standing in the lobby, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went up to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and tackled him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a job.
<p/>'' What can you do? '' the man asked. '' Anything, sir,'' said Jurgis, and added quickly: <div class="bookquote">``I've been out of work for a long time, sir.
<p/>I'm an honest man, and I'm strong and willing-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>The other was eying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) narrowly. '' Do you drink? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked.
<p/>'' No, sir,'' said Jurgis. '' Well, I've been employing a man as a porter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) drinks. I've discharged him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) seven times now, and I've about made up my mind
<p/>that's enough. Would you be a porter?'' '' Yes, sir.'' '' It's hard work. You'll have to clean floors and wash spittoons and fill lamps and handle trunks--
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I'm willing, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' All right. I'll pay you thirty a month and board, and you can begin now, if you feel like it.
<p/>You can put on the other fellow's rig. '' And so Jurgis fell to work, and toiled like a Trojan till night.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) went and told Elzbieta, and also, late as it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) paid a visit to Ostrinski to let him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) know of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) good fortune.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) received a great surprise, for when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was describing the location of the hotel Ostrinski interrupted suddenly, <div class="bookquote">``Not Hinds's!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Ostrinski</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' said Jurgis, <div class="bookquote">``that's the name. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>To which the other replied, <div class="bookquote">``Then you've got the best boss in Chicago
<p/>So the next morning Jurgis went to his (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>) employer and told him (<font color='blue'><b>boss</b></font>); and the man seized him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the hand and shook it.
<p/>--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s a state organizer of our party, and one of our best-known speakers! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jove</b></font>)</div>'' By Jove! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, ``that lets me out.
<p/>So, after that, Jurgis was known to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``boss''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>as <div class="bookquote">``Comrade Jurgis,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>and in return he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was expected to call him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Comrade Hinds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Tommy''  (<font color='red'><b>Tommy Hinds</b></font>)</div>Hinds, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) was known to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) intimates, was a squat little man, with broad shoulders and a florid face, decorated with gray side whiskers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the kindest-hearted man that ever lived, and the liveliest--inexhaustible in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enthusiasm, and talking Socialism all day and all night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a great fellow to jolly along a crowd, and would keep a meeting in an uproar; when once he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got really waked up, the torrent of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eloquence could be compared with nothing save Niagara.
<p/>Tommy Hinds had begun life as a blacksmith's helper, and had run away to join the Union army, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) first acquaintance with <div class="bookquote">``graft,''  (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div>in the shape of rotten muskets and shoddy blankets.
<p/>To a musket that broke in a crisis he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) always attributed the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) only brother, and upon worthless blankets he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) blamed all the agonies of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) own old age.
<p/>I didn't sleep all last night because I had discharged a good Socialist!'' Whenever it rained, the rheumatism would get into his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) joints, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) would screw up his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) face and mutter:
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had one unfailing remedy for all the evils of this world, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) preached it to every one; no matter whether the person's trouble was failure in business, or dyspepsia, or a quarrelsome mother-in-law, a twinkle would come into his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) eyes and he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) would say, ``You know what to do about it--vote the Socialist ticket!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Capitalism, my boy, capitalism! ' Ecrasez l'infame!' ''  (<font color='red'><b>Tommy Hinds/Hinds</b></font>)</div>'' Tommy Hinds had set out upon the trail of the Octopus as soon as the war was over.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) had gone into business, and found himself in competition with the fortunes of those who had been stealing while he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) had been fighting.
<p/>The city government was in their hands and the railroads were in league with them, and honest business was driven to the wall; and so Hinds had put all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) savings into Chicago real estate, and set out singlehanded to dam the river of graft.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) had been a reform member of the city council, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) had been a Greenbacker, a Labor Unionist, a Populist, a Bryanite--and after thirty years of fighting, the year 1896 had served to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Unionist</b></font>) that the power of concentrated wealth could never be controlled, but could only be destroyed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Unionist</b></font>) had published a pamphlet about it, and set out to organize a party of his (<font color='blue'><b>Unionist</b></font>) own, when a stray Socialist leaflet had revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) that others had been ahead of him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>).
<p/>Now for eight years he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had been fighting for the party, anywhere, everywhere--whether it was a G.A.R. reunion, or a hotel-keepers' convention, or an Afro-American business-men's banquet, or a Bible society picnic, Tommy Hinds would manage to get himself invited to explain the relations of Socialism to the subject in hand.
<p/>After that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) would start off upon a tour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) own, ending at some place between New York and Oregon; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) came back from there, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) would go out to organize new locals for the state committee; and finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) would come home to rest--and talk Socialism in Chicago.
<p/>Hinds's hotel was a very hot-bed of the propaganda; all the employees were party men, and if they were not when they came, they were quite certain to be before they went away.
<p/>The proprietor would get into a discussion with some one in the lobby, and as the conversation grew animated, others would gather about to listen, until finally every one in the place would be crowded into a group, and a regular debate would be under way.
<p/>This went on every night--when Tommy Hinds was not there to do it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) clerk did it; and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) clerk was away campaigning, the assistant attended to it, while Mrs. Hinds sat behind the desk and did the work.
<p/>The clerk was an old crony of the proprietor's, an awkward, rawboned giant of a man, with a lean, sallow face, a broad mouth, and whiskers under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin, the very type and body of a prairie farmer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been that all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had fought the railroads in Kansas for fifty years, a Granger, a Farmers' Alliance man, a <div class="bookquote">``middle-of-the-road''  (<font color='red'><b>Farmers Alliance man</b></font>)</div>Populist.
<p/>Finally, Tommy Hinds had revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) the wonderful idea of using the trusts instead of destroying them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) had sold his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) farm and come to Chicago.
<p/>That was Amos Struver; and then there was Harry Adams, the assistant clerk, a pale, scholarly-looking man, who came from Massachusetts, of Pilgrim stock.
<p/>Adams had been a cotton operative in Fall River, and the continued depression in the industry had worn him (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) family out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) had emigrated to South Carolina.
<p/>In Massachusetts the percentage of white illiteracy is eight-tenths of one per cent, while in South Carolina it is thirteen and six-tenths per cent; also in South Carolina there is a property qualification for voters--and for these and other reasons child labor is the rule, and so the cotton mills were driving those of Massachusetts out of the business.
<p/>Adams did not know this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) only knew that the Southern mills were running; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) got there he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) found that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) was to live, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) family would have to work, and from six o'clock at night to six o'clock in the morning.
<p/>So he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) had set to work to organize the mill hands, after the fashion in Massachusetts, and had been discharged; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) had gotten other work, and stuck at it, and at last there had been a strike for shorter hours, and Harry Adams had attempted to address a street meeting, which was the end of him (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>).
<p/>In the states of the far South the labor of convicts is leased to contractors, and when there are not convicts enough they have to be supplied.
<p/>Harry Adams was sent up by a judge who was a cousin of the mill owner with whose business he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) had interfered; and though the life had nearly killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) had been wise enough not to murmur, and at the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) term he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) family had left the state of South Carolina--hell's back yard, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) called it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) had no money for carfare, but it was harvest-time, and they walked one day and worked the next; and so Adams got at last to Chicago, and joined the Socialist party.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) was a studious man, reserved, and nothing of an orator; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always had a pile of books under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desk in the hotel, and articles from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pen were beginning to attract attention in the party press.
<p/>Contrary to what one would have expected, all this radicalism did not hurt the hotel business; the radicals flocked to it, and the commercial travelers all found it diverting.
<p/>Now that the Beef Trust had adopted the trick of raising prices to induce enormous shipments of cattle, and then dropping them again and scooping in all they needed, a stock raiser was very apt to find himself in Chicago without money enough to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>raiser</b></font>) freight bill; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>raiser</b></font>) had to go to a cheap hotel, and it was no drawback to him (<font color='blue'><b>raiser</b></font>) if there was an agitator talking in the lobby.
<p/>These Western fellows were just <div class="bookquote">``meat''  (<font color='red'><b>These fellows</b></font>)</div>for Tommy Hinds--he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) would get a dozen of them around him (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) and paint little pictures of <div class="bookquote">``the System.
<p/>Of course, it was not a week before he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) had heard Jurgis's story, and after that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) would not have let his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) new porter go for the world.
<p/>See here,''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) would say, in the middle of an argument, <div class="bookquote">``I've got a fellow right here in my place who's worked there and seen every bit of it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>And then Jurgis would drop his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) work, whatever it was, and come, and the other would say, <div class="bookquote">``Comrade Jurgis, just tell these gentlemen what you saw on the killing-beds.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/>At first this request caused poor Jurgis the most acute agony, and it was like pulling teeth to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Comrade</b></font>) to talk; but gradually he (<font color='blue'><b>Comrade</b></font>) found out what was wanted, and in the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Comrade</b></font>) learned to stand up and speak his (<font color='blue'><b>Comrade</b></font>) piece with enthusiasm.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Comrade</b></font>) employer would sit by and encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>Comrade</b></font>) with exclamations and shakes of the head; when Jurgis would give the formula for <div class="bookquote">``potted ham,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>or tell about the condemned hogs that were dropped into the <div class="bookquote">``destructors''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>at the top and immediately taken out again at the bottom, to be shipped into another state and made into lard, Tommy Hinds would bang his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) knee and cry, <div class="bookquote">``Do you think a man could make up a thing like that out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Tommy Hinds/Hinds</b></font>)</div>And then the hotel-keeper would go on to show how the Socialists had the only real remedy for such evils, how they alone <div class="bookquote">``meant business''  (<font color='red'><b>the Socialists</b></font>)</div>with the Beef Trust.
<p/>And when, in answer to this, the victim would say that the whole country was getting stirred up, that the newspapers were full of denunciations of it, and the government taking action against it, Tommy Hinds had a knock-out blow all ready.
<p/>Of late, also, the hotel had become a favorite stopping place for Western cattlemen. '' '' '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) would say, ``all that is true--but what do you suppose is the reason for it?
<p/>There are other trusts in the country just as illegal and extortionate as the Beef Trust: there is the Coal Trust, that freezes the poor in winter--there is the Steel Trust, that doubles the price of every nail in your shoes--there is the Oil Trust, that keeps you from reading at night--and why do you suppose it is that all the fury of the press and the government is directed against the Beef Trust?
<p/>And when to this the victim would reply that there was clamor enough over the Oil Trust, the other would continue: <div class="bookquote">``Ten years ago Henry D. Lloyd told all the truth about the Standard Oil Company in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) Wealth versus Commonwealth; and the book was allowed to die, and you hardly ever hear of it.
<p/>Are you foolish enough to believe that it's done for the public? ''  (<font color='red'><b>this the victim</b></font>)</div>And now, at last, two magazines have the courage to tackle `Standard Oil' again, and what happens?
<p/>The newspapers ridicule the authors, the churches defend the criminals, and the government--does nothing. And now, why is it all so different with the Beef Trust?
<p/>Here the other would generally admit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``stuck'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and Tommy Hinds would explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>), and it was fun to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) eyes open.
<p/>If you were a Socialist,'' the hotel-keeper would say, <div class="bookquote">``you would understand that the power which really governs the United States today is the Railroad Trust.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>a Socialist</b></font>)</div>'' It is the Railroad Trust that runs your state government, wherever you live, and that runs the United States Senate.
<p/>The Beef Trust has defied the railroads--it is plundering them day by day through the Private Car; and so the public is roused to fury, and the papers clamor for action, and the government goes on the war-path!
<p/>And you poor common people watch and applaud the job, and think it's all done for you, and never dream that it is really the grand climax of the century-long battle of commercial competition--the final death grapple between the chiefs of the Beef Trust and `Standard Oil,' for the prize of the mastery and ownership of the United States of America!''
<p/>And all of the trusts that I have named are railroad trusts--save only the Beef Trust! Such was the new home in which Jurgis lived and worked, and in which his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) education was completed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would have cut off one hand for Tommy Hinds; and to keep Hinds's hotel a thing of beauty was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) joy in life.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Hinds</b></font>) had a score of Socialist arguments chasing through his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) brain in the meantime did not interfere with this; on the contrary, Jurgis scrubbed the spittoons and polished the banisters all the more vehemently because at the same time he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) was wrestling inwardly with an imaginary recalcitrant.
<p/>It would be pleasant to record that he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) swore off drinking immediately, and all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) bad habits with it; but that would hardly be exact.
<p/>These revolutionists were not angels; they were men, and men who had come up from the social pit, and with the mire of it smeared over them.
<p/>Some of them drank, and some of them swore, and some of them ate pie with their knives; there was only one difference between them and all the rest of the populace--that they were men with a hope, with a cause to fight for and suffer for.
<p/>There came times to Jurgis when the vision seemed far-off and pale, and a glass of beer loomed large in comparison; but if the glass led to another glass, and to too many glasses, he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had something to spur him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) to remorse and resolution on the morrow.
<p/>It was so evidently a wicked thing to spend one's pennies for drink, when the working class was wandering in darkness, and waiting to be delivered; the price of a glass of beer would buy fifty copies of a leaflet, and one could hand these out to the unregenerate, and then get drunk upon the thought of the good that was being accomplished.
<p/>That was the way the movement had been made, and it was the only way it would progress; it availed nothing to know of it, without fighting for it--it was a thing for all, not for a few!
<p/>A corollary of this proposition of course was, that any one who refused to receive the new gospel was personally responsible for keeping Jurgis from his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heart's desire; and this, alas, made him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) uncomfortable as an acquaintance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) met some neighbors with whom Elzbieta had made friends in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) neighborhood, and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) set out to make Socialists of them by wholesale, and several times he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) all but got into a fight.
<p/>Perhaps you would imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) did not do much work there, but that would be a great mistake. It was all so painfully obvious to Jurgis!
<p/>Here were all the opportunities of the country, the land, and the buildings upon the land, the railroads, the mines, the factories, and the stores, all in the hands of a few private individuals, called capitalists, for whom the people were obliged to work for wages.
<p/>The whole balance of what the people produced went to heap up the fortunes of these capitalists, to heap, and heap again, and yet again--and that in spite of the fact that they, and every one about them, lived in unthinkable luxury!
<p/>And was it not plain that if the people cut off the share of those who merely <div class="bookquote">``owned,''  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>the share of those who worked would be much greater?
<p/>That was as plain as two and two makes four; and it was the whole of it, absolutely the whole of it; and yet there were people who could not see it, who would argue about everything else in the world.
<p/>They would tell you that governments could not manage things as economically as private individuals; they would repeat and repeat that, and think they were saying something!
<p/>They could not see that <div class="bookquote">``economical''  (<font color='red'><b>masters</b></font>)</div>management by masters meant simply that they, the people, were worked harder and ground closer and paid less!
<p/>They were wage-earners and servants, at the mercy of exploiters whose one thought was to get as much out of them as possible; and they were taking an interest in the process, were anxious lest it should not be done thoroughly enough!
<p/>It was so incomprehensible how a man could fail to see it! Was it not honestly a trial to listen to an argument such as that?
<p/>You would begin talking to some poor devil who had worked in one shop for the last thirty years, and had never been able to save a penny; who left home every morning at six o'clock, to go and tend a machine, and come back at night too tired to take his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) clothes off; who had never had a week's vacation in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) life, had never traveled, never had an adventure, never learned anything, never hoped anything--and when you started to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) about Socialism he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) would sniff and say, ``I'm not interested in that--I'm an individualist!
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) would go on to tell you that Socialism was <div class="bookquote">``paternalism,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and that if it ever had its way the world would stop progressing.
<p/>It was enough to make a mule laugh, to hear arguments like that; and yet it was no laughing matter, as you found out--for how many millions of such poor deluded wretches there were, whose lives had been so stunted by capitalism that they no longer knew what freedom was!
<p/>And they really thought that it was <div class="bookquote">``individualism''  (<font color='red'><b>thousands</b></font>)</div>for tens of thousands of them to herd together and obey the orders of a steel magnate, and produce hundreds of millions of dollars of wealth for him (<font color='blue'><b>magnate</b></font>), and then let him (<font color='blue'><b>magnate</b></font>) give them libraries; while for them to take the industry, and run it to suit themselves, and build their own libraries--that would have been <div class="bookquote">``Paternalism'' (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>!
<p/>Sometimes the agony of such things as this was almost more than Jurgis could bear; yet there was no way of escape from it, there was nothing to do but to dig away at the base of this mountain of ignorance and prejudice.
<p/>You must keep at the poor fellow; you must hold your temper, and argue with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and watch for your chance to stick an idea or two into his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) head.
<p/>And the rest of the time you must sharpen up your weapons--you must think out new replies to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) objections, and provide yourself with new facts to prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) the folly of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ways.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would carry in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) pocket a tract or a pamphlet which some one had loaned him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had an idle moment during the day he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would plod through a paragraph, and then think about it while he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) worked.
<p/>And yet there were things even worse. '' So Jurgis acquired the reading habit. Also he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) read the newspapers, and asked questions about them.
<p/>One of the other porters at Hinds's was a sharp little Irishman, who knew everything that Jurgis wanted to know; and while they were busy he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) would explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) the geography of America, and its history, its constitution and its laws; also he (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Irishman</b></font>) an idea of the business system of the country, the great railroads and corporations, and who owned them, and the labor unions, and the big strikes, and the men who had led them.
<p/>During the campaign one was not dependent upon the street corner affairs, where the weather and the quality of the orator were equally uncertain; there were hall meetings every night, and one could hear speakers of national prominence.
<p/>These discussed the political situation from every point of view, and all that troubled Jurgis was the impossibility of carrying off but a small part of the treasures they offered him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>).
<p/>Then at night, when he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) could get off, Jurgis would attend the Socialist meetings. There was a man who was known in the party as the <div class="bookquote">``Little Giant.
<p/>The Lord had used up so much material in the making of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) head that there had not been enough to complete his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) legs; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) got about on the platform, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) raven whiskers the pillars of capitalism rocked.
<p/>And then there was a young author, who came from California, and had been a salmon fisher, an oyster-pirate, a longshoreman, a sailor; who had tramped the country and been sent to jail, had lived in the Whitechapel slums, and been to the Klondike in search of gold.
<p/>All these things he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) pictured in his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) books, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was a man of genius he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) forced the world to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the party</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had written a veritable encyclopedia upon the subject, a book that was nearly as big as himself-- Now he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was famous, but wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) went he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) still preached the gospel of the poor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had made a fortune in business, and spent nearly all of it in building up a magazine, which the post office department had tried to suppress, and had driven to Canada.
<p/>And then there was one who was known at the <div class="bookquote">``millionaire Socialist. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) was a quiet-mannered man, whom you would have taken for anything in the world but a Socialist agitator.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>agitator</b></font>) speech was simple and informal--he (<font color='blue'><b>agitator</b></font>) could not understand why any one should get excited about these things. It was a process of economic evolution, he (<font color='blue'><b>agitator</b></font>) said, and he (<font color='blue'><b>agitator</b></font>) exhibited its laws and methods.
<p/>Those who lost in the struggle were generally exterminated; but now and then they had been known to save themselves by combination--which was a new and higher kind of strength.
<p/>It was so that the gregarious animals had overcome the predaceous; it was so, in human history, that the people had mastered the kings.
<p/>Life was a struggle for existence, and the strong overcame the weak, and in turn were overcome by the strongest. The workers were simply the citizens of industry, and the Socialist movement was the expression of their will to survive.
<p/>The inevitability of the revolution depended upon this fact, that they had no choice but to unite or be exterminated; this fact, grim and inexorable, depended upon no human will, it was the law of the economic process, of which the editor showed the details with the most marvelous precision.
<p/>And later on came the evening of the great meeting of the campaign, when Jurgis heard the two standard-bearers of his (<font color='blue'><b>editor</b></font>) party.
<p/>Ten years before there had been in Chicago a strike of a hundred and fifty thousand railroad employees, and thugs had been hired by the railroads to commit violence, and the President of the United States had sent in troops to break the strike, by flinging the officers of the union into jail without trial.
<p/>The president of the union came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) cell a ruined man; but also he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) came out a Socialist; and now for just ten years he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had been traveling up and down the country, standing face to face with the people, and pleading with them for justice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) was a man of electric presence, tall and gaunt, with a face worn thin by struggle and suffering. The fury of outraged manhood gleamed in it--and the tears of suffering little children pleaded in his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) voice.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) paced the stage, lithe and eager, like a panther. He (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) leaned over, reaching out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) audience; he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) pointed into their souls with an insistent finger.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) voice was husky from much speaking, but the great auditorium was as still as death, and every one heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>).
<p/>And then, as Jurgis came out from this meeting, some one handed him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) a paper which he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) carried home with him (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) and read; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) became acquainted with the ``Appeal to Reason.
<p/>About twelve years previously a Colorado real-estate speculator had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) mind that it was wrong to gamble in the necessities of life of human beings: and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had retired and begun the publication of a Socialist weekly.
<p/>There had come a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) own type, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) had held on and won out, and now his (<font color='blue'><b>Socialist</b></font>) publication was an institution.
<p/>It used a carload of paper every week, and the mail trains would be hours loading up at the depot of the little Kansas town.
<p/>It was a four-page weekly, which sold for less than half a cent a copy; its regular subscription list was a quarter of a million, and it went to every crossroads post office in America.
<p/>It had a manner all its own--it was full of ginger and spice, of Western slang and hustle: It collected news of the doings of the <div class="bookquote">``plutes,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and served it up for the benefit of the <div class="bookquote">``American working-mule.
<p/>It would have columns of the deadly parallel--the million dollars' worth of diamonds, or the fancy pet-poodle establishment of a society dame, beside the fate of Mrs. Murphy of San Francisco, who had starved to death on the streets, or of John Robinson, just out of the hospital, who had hanged himself in New York because he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) could not find work.
<p/>It collected the stories of graft and misery from the daily press, and made a little pungent paragraphs out of them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The <div class="bookquote">``Appeal''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was a <div class="bookquote">``propaganda''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>paper. '' '' Three banks of Bungtown, South Dakota, failed, and more savings of the workers swallowed up!''
<p/>'' The mayor of Sandy Creek, Oklahoma, has skipped with a hundred thousand dollars. That's the kind of rulers the old partyites give you!''
<p/>'' The president of the Florida Flying Machine Company is in jail for bigamy. He (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) was a prominent opponent of Socialism, which he (<font color='blue'><b>president</b></font>) said would break up the home!''
<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``Appeal''  (<font color='red'><b>the faithful</b></font>)</div>had what it called its <div class="bookquote">``Army,''  (<font color='red'><b>the faithful</b></font>)</div>about thirty thousand of the faithful, who did things for it; and it was always exhorting the <div class="bookquote">``Army''  (<font color='red'><b>the faithful</b></font>)</div>to keep its dander up, and occasionally encouraging it with a prize competition, for anything from a gold watch to a private yacht or an eighty-acre farm.
<p/>Its office helpers were all known to the <div class="bookquote">``Army''  (<font color='red'><b>office helpers</b></font>)</div>by quaint titles--<div class="bookquote">``Inky Ike,''  (<font color='red'><b>office helpers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``the Bald-headed Man,''  (<font color='red'><b>office helpers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``the Redheaded Girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>office helpers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``the Bulldog,''  (<font color='red'><b>office helpers</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``the Office Goat,''  (<font color='red'><b>office helpers</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``the One Hoss.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>office helpers</b></font>)</div>But sometimes, again, the <div class="bookquote">``Appeal''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>would be desperately serious. It sent a correspondent to Colorado, and printed pages describing the overthrow of American institutions in that state.
<p/>In a certain city of the country it had over forty of its <div class="bookquote">``Army''  (<font color='red'><b>Socialists</b></font>)</div>in the headquarters of the Telegraph Trust, and no message of importance to Socialists ever went through that a copy of it did not go to the ``Appeal.
<p/>It would print great broadsides during the campaign; one copy that came to Jurgis was a manifesto addressed to striking workingmen, of which nearly a million copies had been distributed in the industrial centers, wherever the employers' associations had been carrying out their <div class="bookquote">``open shop''  (<font color='red'><b>the employers</b></font>)</div>program.
<p/>'' '' You have lost the strike! '' it was headed. '' And now what are you going to do about it?
<p/>'' It was what is called an <div class="bookquote">``incendiary''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>appeal--it was written by a man into whose soul the iron had entered.
<p/>When this edition appeared, twenty thousand copies were sent to the stockyards district; and they were taken out and stowed away in the rear of a little cigar store, and every evening, and on Sundays, the members of the Packingtown locals would get armfuls and distribute them on the streets and in the houses.
<p/>The people of Packingtown had lost their strike, if ever a people had, and so they read these papers gladly, and twenty thousand were hardly enough to go round.
<p/>Jurgis had resolved not to go near his (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) old home again, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) heard of this it was too much for him (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>), and every night for a week he (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) would get on the car and ride out to the stockyards, and help to undo his (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) work of the previous year, when he (<font color='blue'><b>members</b></font>) had sent Mike Scully's ten-pin setter to the city Board of Aldermen.
<p/>It was quite marvelous to see what a difference twelve months had made in Packingtown--the eyes of the people were getting opened!
<p/>The Socialists were literally sweeping everything before them that election, and Scully and the Cook County machine were at their wits' end for an ``issue.
<p/>At the very close of the campaign they bethought themselves of the fact that the strike had been broken by Negroes, and so they sent for a South Carolina fire-eater, the <div class="bookquote">``pitchfork senator,''  (<font color='red'><b>a South Carolina fire-eater</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) was called, a man who took off his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) coat when he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) talked to workingmen, and damned and swore like a Hessian.
<p/>This meeting they advertised extensively, and the Socialists advertised it too--with the result that about a thousand of them were on hand that evening.
<p/>The <div class="bookquote">``pitchfork senator''  (<font color='red'><b>party</b></font>)</div>stood their fusillade of questions for about an hour, and then went home in disgust, and the balance of the meeting was a strictly party affair.
<p/>Jurgis, who had insisted upon coming, had the time of his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) life that night; he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) danced about and waved his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) arms in his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) excitement--and at the very climax he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) broke loose from his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) friends, and got out into the aisle, and proceeded to make a speech himself!
<p/>The senator had been denying that the Democratic party was corrupt; it was always the Republicans who bought the votes, he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) said--and here was Jurgis shouting furiously, ``It's a lie!
<p/>After which he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) went on to tell them how he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) knew it--that he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) knew it because he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) had bought them himself!
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) would have told the <div class="bookquote">``pitchfork senator''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>all his (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) experiences, had not Harry Adams and a friend grabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) about the neck and shoved him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) into a seat.
<p/>Chapter 31 One of the first things that Jurgis had done after he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got a job was to go and see Marija.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) came down into the basement of the house to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stood by the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hand, saying, <div class="bookquote">``I've got work now, and so you can leave here.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It's a lie!'' '' But Marija only shook her (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) head. There was nothing else for her (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) to do, she (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) said, and nobody to employ her (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) past a secret--girls had tried it, and they were always found out. There were thousands of men who came to this place, and sooner or later she (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) would meet one of them.
<p/>'' And besides,'' Marija added, <div class="bookquote">``I can't do anything. I'm no good--I take dope. What could you do with me?''  (<font color='red'><b>Marija/Marija Berczynskas</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can't you stop?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div><p/>Jurgis cried. '' No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I'll never stop. What's the use of talking about it--I'll stay here till I die, I guess.
<p/>It's all I'm fit for. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And that was all that he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) could get her (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) to say --there was no use trying.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>senator</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) would not let Elzbieta take her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) answered indifferently: <div class="bookquote">``Then it'll be wasted here--that's all.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) eyelids looked heavy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) face was red and swollen; he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) was annoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elzbieta</b></font>) only wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) to go away.
<p/>Elzbieta was sick a good deal now, and the boys were wild and unruly, and very much the worse for their life upon the streets.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) stuck by the family nevertheless, for they reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) old happiness; and when things went wrong he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) could solace himself with a plunge into the Socialist movement.
<p/>Since his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) life had been caught up into the current of this great stream, things which had before been the whole of life to him (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) came to seem of relatively slight importance; his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) interests were elsewhere, in the world of ideas.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) outward life was commonplace and uninteresting; he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) was just a hotel-porter, and expected to remain one while he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) lived; but meantime, in the realm of thought, his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) life was a perpetual adventure.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So he (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) went, disappointed and sad. Poor Jurgis was not very happy in his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) home-life. There was so much to know--so many wonders to be discovered!
<p/>Never in all his (<font color='blue'><b>dope</b></font>) life did Jurgis forget the day before election, when there came a telephone message from a friend of Harry Adams, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) to bring Jurgis to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) that night; and Jurgis went, and met one of the minds of the movement.
<p/>The invitation was from a man named Fisher, a Chicago millionaire who had given up his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) life to settlement work, and had a little home in the heart of the city's slums.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) did not belong to the party, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) was in sympathy with it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) was to have as his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) guest that night the editor of a big Eastern magazine, who wrote against Socialism, but really did not know what it was.
<p/>The millionaire suggested that Adams bring Jurgis along, and then start up the subject of <div class="bookquote">``pure food,''  (<font color='red'><b>Jurgis/Jurgis Rudkus/Rudkus</b></font>)</div>in which the editor was interested.
<p/>The room that Jurgis saw was half lined with books, and upon the walls were many pictures, dimly visible in the soft, yellow light; it was a cold, rainy night, so a log fire was crackling in the open hearth.
<p/>Seven or eight people were gathered about it when Adams and his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) friend arrived, and Jurgis saw to his (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) dismay that three of them were ladies.
<p/>Young Fisher's home was a little two-story brick house, dingy and weather-beaten outside, but attractive within. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) had never talked to people of this sort before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) fell into an agony of embarrassment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) stood in the doorway clutching his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) hat tightly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) hands, and made a deep bow to each of the persons as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) was introduced; then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) was asked to have a seat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) took a chair in a dark corner, and sat down upon the edge of it, and wiped the perspiration off his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) sleeve.
<p/>There was the host himself, a tall, athletic young man, clad in evening dress, as also was the editor, a dyspeptic-looking gentleman named Maynard.
<p/>There was the former's frail young wife, and also an elderly lady, who taught kindergarten in the settlement, and a young college student, a beautiful girl with an intense and earnest face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only spoke once or twice while Jurgis was there--the rest of the time she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sat by the table in the center of the room, resting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chin in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands and drinking in the conversation.
<p/>There were two other men, whom young Fisher had introduced to Jurgis as Mr. Lucas and Mr. Schliemann; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) heard them address Adams as <div class="bookquote">``Comrade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry/Adams/Harry Adams</b></font>)</div>and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Comrade</b></font>) knew that they were Socialists.
<p/>The one called Lucas was a mild and meek-looking little gentleman of clerical aspect; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been an itinerant evangelist, it transpired, and had seen the light and become a prophet of the new dispensation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>prophet</b></font>) traveled all over the country, living like the apostles of old, upon hospitality, and preaching upon street-corners when there was no hall.
<p/>The other man had been in the midst of a discussion with the editor when Adams and Jurgis came in; and at the suggestion of the host they resumed it after the interruption.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) was terrified lest they should expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Adams</b></font>) to talk. Jurgis was soon sitting spellbound, thinking that here was surely the strangest man that had ever lived in the world.
<p/>Nicholas Schliemann was a Swede, a tall, gaunt person, with hairy hands and bristling yellow beard; he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) was a university man, and had been a professor of philosophy--until, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) had found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) was selling his (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) character as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) time.
<p/>Instead he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) had come to America, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) lived in a garret room in this slum district, and made volcanic energy take the place of fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) studied the composition of food-stuffs, and knew exactly how many proteids and carbohydrates his (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) body needed; and by scientific chewing he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) tripled the value of all he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) ate, so that it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) eleven cents a day.
<p/>About the first of July he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) would leave Chicago for his (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) vacation, on foot; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) struck the harvest fields he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) would set to work for two dollars and a half a day, and come home when he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) had another year's supply--a hundred and twenty-five dollars.
<p/>That was the nearest approach to independence a man could make <div class="bookquote">``under capitalism,''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) explained; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would never marry, for no sane man would allow himself to fall in love until after the revolution.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat in a big arm-chair, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) legs crossed, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head so far in the shadow that one saw only two glowing lights, reflected from the fire on the hearth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoke simply, and utterly without emotion; with the manner of a teacher setting forth to a group of scholars an axiom in geometry, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would enunciate such propositions as made the hair of an ordinary person rise on end.
<p/>And when the auditor had asserted his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) non-comprehension, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would proceed to elucidate by some new proposition, yet more appalling. To Jurgis the Herr Dr. Schliemann assumed the proportions of a thunderstorm or an earthquake.
<p/>And yet, strange as it might seem, there was a subtle bond between them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could follow the argument nearly all the time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was carried over the difficult places in spite of himself; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went plunging away in mad career--a very Mazeppa-ride upon the wild horse Speculation.
<p/>Nicholas Schliemann was familiar with all the universe, and with man as a small part of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understood human institutions, and blew them about like soap bubbles.
<p/>It was surprising that so much destructiveness could be contained in one human mind. Was it government? The purpose of government was the guarding of property-rights, the perpetuation of ancient force and modern fraud.
<p/>Or was it marriage? Marriage and prostitution were two sides of one shield, the predatory man's exploitation of the sex-pleasure. The difference between them was a difference of class.
<p/>If a woman had money she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might dictate her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own terms: equality, a life contract, and the legitimacy--that is, the property-rights--of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no money, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a proletarian, and sold herself for an existence. And then the subject became Religion, which was the Archfiend's deadliest weapon.
<p/>Government oppressed the body of the wage-slave, but Religion oppressed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind, and poisoned the stream of progress at its source.
<p/>The working-man was to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hopes upon a future life, while his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pockets were picked in this one; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was brought up to frugality, humility, obedience--in short to all the pseudo-virtues of capitalism.
<p/>The destiny of civilization would be decided in one final death struggle between the Red International and the Black, between Socialism and the Roman Catholic Church; while here at home, <div class="bookquote">``the stygian midnight of American evangelicalism--
<p/>Comrade''  (<font color='red'><b>Catholic</b></font>)</div>Lucas was not what is called an educated man; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) knew only the Bible, but it was the Bible interpreted by real experience.
<p/>'' And here the ex-preacher entered the field, and there was a lively tussle. '' And what was the use, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) asked, of confusing Religion with men's perversions of it?
<p/>That the church was in the hands of the merchants at the moment was obvious enough; but already there were signs of rebellion, and if Comrade Schliemann could come back a few years from now--
<p/>Ah, yes,'' said the other, <div class="bookquote">``of course, I have no doubt that in a hundred years the Vatican will be denying that it ever opposed Socialism, just as at present it denies that it ever tortured Galileo.
<p/>I am defending the word of God--which is one long cry of the human spirit for deliverance from the sway of oppression.
<p/>Take the twenty-fourth chapter of the Book of Job, which I am accustomed to quote in my addresses as `the Bible upon the Beef Trust'; or take the words of Isaiah--or of the Master himself!
<p/>Not the elegant prince of our debauched and vicious art, not the jeweled idol of our society churches--but the Jesus of the awful reality, the man of sorrow and pain, the outcast, despised of the world, who had nowhere to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>outcast</b></font>) head--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Schliemann/Nicholas Schliemann</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I am not defending the Vatican,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucas</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lucas, vehemently.

<p/>Well, then,'' cried Lucas, <div class="bookquote">``and why should Jesus have nothing to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) church--why should his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) words and his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) life be of no authority among those who profess to adore him (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>)?
<p/>Here is a man who was the world's first revolutionist, the true founder of the Socialist movement; a man whose whole being was one flame of hatred for wealth, and all that wealth stands for,--for the pride of wealth, and the luxury of wealth, and the tyranny of wealth; who was himself a beggar and a tramp, a man of the people, an associate of saloon-keepers and women of the town; who again and again, in the most explicit language, denounced wealth and the holding of wealth: `Lay not up for yourselves treasures on earth!'--`Sell that ye have and give alms!'--`Blessed are ye poor, for yours is the kingdom of Heaven!'--`Woe unto you that are rich, for ye have received your consolation!'--`Verily, I say unto you, that a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of Heaven!'
<p/>Who denounced in unmeasured terms the exploiters of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own time: `Woe unto you, scribes and pharisees, hypocrites!'--`Woe unto you also, you lawyers!'--`Ye serpents, ye generation of vipers, how can ye escape the damnation of hell?'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lucas</b></font>)</div>Who drove out the business men and brokers from the temple with a whip! Who was crucified--think of it--for an incendiary and a disturber of the social order!
<p/>And this man they have made into the high priest of property and smug respectability, a divine sanction of all the horrors and abominations of modern commercial civilization!
<p/>Jeweled images are made of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), sensual priests burn incense to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and modern pirates of industry bring their dollars, wrung from the toil of helpless women and children, and build temples to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and sit in cushioned seats and listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) teachings expounded by doctors of dusty divinity--
<p/>But the other was in full career--he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had talked this subject every day for five years, and had never yet let himself be stopped.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Bravo! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Schliemann/Nicholas Schliemann</b></font>)</div>cried Schliemann, laughing. '' This Jesus of Nazareth! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) cried. '' This class-conscious working-man! This union carpenter!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), the sovereign lord and master of a world which grinds the bodies and souls of human beings into dollars--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) could come into the world this day and see the things that men have made in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) name, would it not blast his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) soul with horror?
<p/>This agitator, law-breaker, firebrand, anarchist! Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) not go mad at the sight of it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) the Prince of Mercy and Love!
<p/>That dreadful night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) lay in the Garden of Gethsemane and writhed in agony until he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) sweat blood--do you think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) saw anything worse than he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) might see tonight upon the plains of Manchuria, where men march out with a jeweled image of him (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) before them, to do wholesale murder for the benefit of foul monsters of sensuality and cruelty?
<p/>Do you not know that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) were in St. Petersburg now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) would take the whip with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) drove out the bankers from his (<font color='blue'><b>Prince</b></font>) temple--

<p/>No, no, a thousand times no!--we shall use his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) authority to turn out the knaves and sluggards from his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) ministry, and we shall yet rouse the people to

'' Here, comrade,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) said, with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``here is a place for you to begin.
<p/>A bishop whose wife has just been robbed of fifty thousand dollars' worth of diamonds! And a most unctuous and oily of bishops!
<p/>An eminent and scholarly bishop! A philanthropist and friend of labor bishop--a Civic Federation decoy duck for the chloroforming of the wage-working-man!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But now Mr. Maynard, the editor, took occasion to remark, somewhat naively, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maynard</b></font>) had always understood that Socialists had a cut-and-dried program for the future of civilization; whereas here were two active members of the party, who, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Maynard</b></font>) could make out, were agreed about nothing at all.
<p/>Would the two, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Maynard</b></font>) enlightenment, try to ascertain just what they had in common, and why they belonged to the same party?
<p/>To this little passage of arms the rest of the company sat as spectators. This resulted, after much debating, in the formulating of two carefully worded propositions:
<p/>First, that a Socialist believes in the common ownership and democratic management of the means of producing the necessities of life; and, second, that a Socialist believes that the means by which this is to be brought about is the class conscious political organization of the wage-earners.
<p/>Thus far they were at one; but no farther. To Lucas, the religious zealot, the co-operative commonwealth was the New Jerusalem, the kingdom of Heaven, which is <div class="bookquote">``within you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the zealot</b></font>)</div>To the other, Socialism was simply a necessary step toward a far-distant goal, a step to be tolerated with impatience.
<p/>Schliemann called himself a <div class="bookquote">``philosophic anarchist'' (<font color='red'><b>Schliemann/Nicholas Schliemann</b></font>)</div>; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) explained that an anarchist was one who believed that the end of human existence was the free development of every personality, unrestricted by laws save those of its own being.
<p/>Since the same kind of match would light every one's fire and the same-shaped loaf of bread would fill every one's stomach, it would be perfectly feasible to submit industry to the control of a majority vote.
<p/>Of intellectual and moral things, on the other hand, there was no limit, and one could have more without another's having less; hence <div class="bookquote">``Communism in material production, anarchism in intellectual,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the formula of modern proletarian thought.
<p/>As soon as the birth agony was over, and the wounds of society had been healed, there would be established a simple system whereby each man was credited with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) labor and debited with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) purchases; and after that the processes of production, exchange, and consumption would go on automatically, and without our being conscious of them, any more than a man is conscious of the beating of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart.
<p/>And then, explained Schliemann, society would break up into independent, self-governing communities of mutually congenial persons; examples of which at present were clubs, churches, and political parties.
<p/>After the revolution, all the intellectual, artistic, and spiritual activities of men would be cared for by such <div class="bookquote">``free associations'' (<font color='red'><b>men</b></font>)</div>; romantic novelists would be supported by those who liked to read romantic novels, and impressionist painters would be supported by those who liked to look at impressionist pictures--and the same with preachers and scientists, editors and actors and musicians.
<p/>If any one wanted to work or paint or pray, and could find no one to maintain him (<font color='blue'><b>novelists</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>novelists</b></font>) could support himself by working part of the time.
<p/>That was the case at present, the only difference being that the competitive wage system compelled a man to work all the time to live, while, after the abolition of privilege and exploitation, any one would be able to support himself by an hour's work a day.
<p/>Also the artist's audience of the present was a small minority of people, all debased and vulgarized by the effort it had cost them to win in the commercial battle, of the intellectual and artistic activities which would result when the whole of mankind was set free from the nightmare of competition, we could at present form no conception whatever.
<p/>And then the editor wanted to know upon what ground Dr. Schliemann asserted that it might be possible for a society to exist upon an hour's toil by each of its members.
<p/>Just what,'' answered the other, <div class="bookquote">``would be the productive capacity of society if the present resources of science were utilized, we have no means of ascertaining; but we may be sure it would exceed anything that would sound reasonable to minds inured to the ferocious barbarities of capitalism.
<p/>After the triumph of the international proletariat, war would of course be inconceivable; and who can figure the cost of war to humanity--not merely the value of the lives and the material that it destroys, not merely the cost of keeping millions of men in idleness, of arming and equipping them for battle and parade, but the drain upon the vital energies of society by the war attitude and the war terror, the brutality and ignorance, the drunkenness, prostitution, and crime it entails, the industrial impotence and the moral deadness?
<p/>Do you think that it would be too much to say that two hours of the working time of every efficient member of a community goes to feed the red fiend of war?
<p/>And then Schliemann went on to outline some of the wastes of competition: the losses of industrial warfare; the ceaseless worry and friction; the vices--such as drink, for instance, the use of which had nearly doubled in twenty years, as a consequence of the intensification of the economic struggle; the idle and unproductive members of the community, the frivolous rich and the pauperized poor; the law and the whole machinery of repression; the wastes of social ostentation, the milliners and tailors, the hairdressers, dancing masters, chefs and lackeys.
<p/>You understand,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>masters</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``that in a society dominated by the fact of commercial competition, money is necessarily the test of prowess, and wastefulness the sole criterion of power.
<p/>So we have, at the present moment, a society with, say, thirty per cent of the population occupied in producing useless articles, and one per cent occupied in destroying them.
<p/>And this is not all; for the servants and panders of the parasites are also parasites, the milliners and the jewelers and the lackeys have also to be supported by the useful members of the community.
<p/>And bear in mind also that this monstrous disease affects not merely the idlers and their menials, its poison penetrates the whole social body.
<p/>Beneath the hundred thousand women of the elite are a million middle-class women, miserable because they are not of the elite, and trying to appear of it in public; and beneath them, in turn, are five million farmers' wives reading `fashion papers' and trimming bonnets, and shop-girls and serving-maids selling themselves into brothels for cheap jewelry and imitation seal-skin robes.
<p/>And then consider that, added to this competition in display, you have, like oil on the flames, a whole system of competition in selling!
<p/>You have manufacturers contriving tens of thousands of catchpenny devices, storekeepers displaying them, and newspapers and magazines filled up with advertisements of them!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was only one earth, and the quantity of material things was limited. '' '' '' '' And don't forget the wastes of fraud,'' put in young Fisher.
<p/>When one comes to the ultra-modern profession of advertising,'' responded Schliemann--<div class="bookquote">``the science of persuading people to buy what they do not want--he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) is in the very center of the ghastly charnel house of capitalist destructiveness, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) scarcely knows which of a dozen horrors to point out first.
<p/>But consider the waste in time and energy incidental to making ten thousand varieties of a thing for purposes of ostentation and snobbishness, where one variety would do for use!
<p/>Consider all the waste incidental to the manufacture of cheap qualities of goods, of goods made to sell and deceive the ignorant; consider the wastes of adulteration,--the shoddy clothing, the cotton blankets, the unstable tenements, the ground-cork life-preservers, the adulterated milk, the aniline soda water, the potato-flour sausages--''  (<font color='red'><b>Schliemann/Nicholas Schliemann</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And consider the moral aspects of the thing,''  (<font color='red'><b>the ex-preacher</b></font>)</div>put in the ex-preacher.
<p/>Precisely,'' said Schliemann; <div class="bookquote">``the low knavery and the ferocious cruelty incidental to them, the plotting and the lying and the bribing, the blustering and bragging, the screaming egotism, the hurrying and worrying.
<p/>Of course, imitation and adulteration are the essence of competition--they are but another form of the phrase `to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the dearest.'
<p/>A government official has stated that the nation suffers a loss of a billion and a quarter dollars a year through adulterated foods; which means, of course, not only materials wasted that might have been useful outside of the human stomach, but doctors and nurses for people who would otherwise have been well, and undertakers for the whole human race ten or twenty years before the proper time.
<p/>Then again, consider the waste of time and energy required to sell these things in a dozen stores, where one would do.
<p/>There are a million or two of business firms in the country, and five or ten times as many clerks; and consider the handling and rehandling, the accounting and reaccounting, the planning and worrying, the balancing of petty profit and loss.
<p/>the libraries of ponderous tomes, the courts and juries to interpret them, the lawyers studying to circumvent them, the pettifogging and chicanery, the hatreds and lies!
<p/>Consider the wastes incidental to the blind and haphazard production of commodities--the factories closed, the workers idle, the goods spoiling in storage; consider the activities of the stock manipulator, the paralyzing of whole industries, the overstimulation of others, for speculative purposes; the assignments and bank failures, the crises and panics, the deserted towns and the starving populations!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Schliemann/Nicholas Schliemann</b></font>)</div>'' Consider the whole machinery of the civil law made necessary by these processes; Consider the energies wasted in the seeking of markets,
<p/>Consider the wastes incidental to the crowding into cities, made necessary by competition and by monopoly railroad rates; consider the slums, the bad air, the disease and the waste of vital energies; consider the office buildings, the waste of time and material in the piling of story upon story, and the burrowing underground!
<p/>Then take the whole business of insurance, the enormous mass of administrative and clerical labor it involves, and all utter waste--
<p/>the sterile trades, such as drummer, solicitor, bill-poster, advertising agent. '' <div class="bookquote">``I do not follow that,''  (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div>said the editor. '' The Cooperative Commonwealth is a universal automatic insurance company and savings bank for all its members.
<p/>Capital being the property of all , injury to it is shared by all and made up by all. The bank is the universal government credit-account, the ledger in which every individual's earnings and spendings are balanced.
<p/>There is also a universal government bulletin, in which are listed and precisely described everything which the commonwealth has for sale.
<p/>As no one makes any profit by the sale, there is no longer any stimulus to extravagance, and no misrepresentation; no cheating, no adulteration or imitation, no bribery or `grafting.'''
<p/>The price is the labor it has cost to make and deliver it, and it is determined by the first principles of arithmetic.
<p/>The million workers in the nation's wheat fields have worked a hundred days each, and the total product of the labor is a billion bushels, so the value of a bushel of wheat is the tenth part of a farm labor-day.
<p/>If we employ an arbitrary symbol, and pay, say, five dollars a day for farm work, then the cost of a bushel of wheat is fifty cents.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How is the price of an article determined?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``You say `for farm work,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maynard/Maynard</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Maynard. '' Then labor is not to be paid alike?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Manifestly not, since some work is easy and some hard, and we should have millions of rural mail carriers, and no coal miners.
<p/>Of course the wages may be left the same, and the hours varied; one or the other will have to be varied continually, according as a greater or less number of workers is needed in any particular industry.
<p/>That is precisely what is done at present, except that the transfer of the workers is accomplished blindly and imperfectly, by rumors and advertisements, instead of instantly and completely, by a universal government bulletin.

<p/>I live on the same earth as the majority, I wear the same kind of shoes and sleep in the same kind of bed; but I do not think the same kind of thoughts, and I do not wish to pay for such thinkers as the majority selects.

<p/>If people want to listen to a certain preacher, they get together and contribute what they please, and pay for a church and support the preacher, and then listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>); I, who do not want to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>), stay away, and it costs me nothing.
<p/>In the same way there are magazines about Egyptian coins, and Catholic saints, and flying machines, and athletic records, and I know nothing about any of them.
<p/>On the other hand, if wage slavery were abolished, and I could earn some spare money without paying tribute to an exploiting capitalist, then there would be a magazine for the purpose of interpreting and popularizing the gospel of Friedrich Nietzsche, the prophet of Evolution, and also of Horace Fletcher, the inventor of the noble science of clean eating; and incidentally, perhaps, for the discouraging of long skirts, and the scientific breeding of men and women, and the establishing of divorce by mutual consent.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Schliemann</b></font>)</div>Dr. Schliemann paused for a moment. '' That was a lecture,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Fletcher</b></font>) said with a laugh, <div class="bookquote">``and yet I am only begun!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What else is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Maynard/Maynard</b></font>)</div>asked Maynard. '' I have pointed out some of the negative wastes of competition,'' answered the other.
<p/>Allowing five to a family, there are fifteen million families in this country; and at least ten million of these live separately, the domestic drudge being either the wife or a wage slave.
<p/>Now set aside the modern system of pneumatic house-cleaning, and the economies of co-operative cooking; and consider one single item, the washing of dishes.
<p/>Surely it is moderate to say that the dish-washing for a family of five takes half an hour a day; with ten hours as a day's work, it takes, therefore, half a million able-bodied persons--mostly women to do the dish-washing of the country.
<p/>And note that this is most filthy and deadening and brutalizing work; that it is a cause of anemia, nervousness, ugliness, and ill-temper; of prostitution, suicide, and insanity; of drunken husbands and degenerate children--for all of which things the community has naturally to pay.
<p/>And now consider that in each of my little free communities there would be a machine which would wash and dry the dishes, and do it, not merely to the eye and the touch, but scientifically--sterilizing them--and do it at a saving of all the drudgery and nine-tenths of the time!
<p/>All of these things you may find in the books of Mrs. Gilman; and then take Kropotkin's Fields, Factories, and Workshops, and read about the new science of agriculture, which has been built up in the last ten years; by which, with made soils and intensive culture, a gardener can raise ten or twelve crops in a season, and two hundred tons of vegetables upon a single acre; by which the population of the whole globe could be supported on the soil now cultivated in the United States alone!
<p/>It is impossible to apply such methods now, owing to the ignorance and poverty of our scattered farming population; but imagine the problem of providing the food supply of our nation once taken in hand systematically and rationally, by scientists!
<p/>All the poor and rocky land set apart for a national timber reserve, in which our children play, and our young men hunt, and our poets dwell!
<p/>The most favorable climate and soil for each product selected; the exact requirements of the community known, and the acreage figured accordingly; the most improved machinery employed, under the direction of expert agricultural chemists!
<p/>I was brought up on a farm, and I know the awful deadliness of farm work; and I like to picture it all as it will be after the revolution.
<p/>To picture the great potato-planting machine, drawn by four horses, or an electric motor, ploughing the furrow, cutting and dropping and covering the potatoes, and planting a score of acres a day!
<p/>To picture the great potato-digging machine, run by electricity, perhaps, and moving across a thousand-acre field, scooping up earth and potatoes, and dropping the latter into sacks!
<p/>To every other kind of vegetable and fruit handled in the same way--apples and oranges picked by machinery, cows milked by electricity--things which are already done, as you may know.
<p/>To picture the harvest fields of the future, to which millions of happy men and women come for a summer holiday, brought by special trains, the exactly needful number to each place!
<p/>And to contrast all this with our present agonizing system of independent small farming,--a stunted, haggard, ignorant man, mated with a yellow, lean, and sad-eyed drudge, and toiling from four o'clock in the morning until nine at night, working the children as soon as they are able to walk, scratching the soil with its primitive tools, and shut out from all knowledge and hope, from all their benefits of science and invention, and all the joys of the spirit--held to a bare existence by competition in labor, and boasting of his (<font color='blue'><b>drudge</b></font>) freedom because he (<font color='blue'><b>drudge</b></font>) is too blind to see his (<font color='blue'><b>drudge</b></font>) chains!''
<p/>And then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>drudge</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``place beside this fact of an unlimited food supply, the newest discovery of physiologists, that most of the ills of the human system are due to overfeeding!
<p/>And then again, it has been proven that meat is unnecessary as a food; and meat is obviously more difficult to produce than vegetable food, less pleasant to prepare and handle, and more likely to be unclean.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I have hardly mentioned the positive economies of co-operation. Dr. Schliemann paused a moment. '' But what of that, so long as it tickles the palate more strongly?''
<p/>So long as we have wage slavery,'' answered Schliemann, ``it matters not in the least how debasing and repulsive a task may be, it is easy to find people to perform it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How would Socialism change that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>asked the girl-student, quickly. It was the first time she (<font color='blue'><b>Schliemann</b></font>) had spoken. '' But just as soon as labor is set free, then the price of such work will begin to rise.
<p/>So one by one the old, dingy, and unsanitary factories will come down--it will be cheaper to build new; and so the steamships will be provided with stoking machinery, and so the dangerous trades will be made safe, or substitutes will be found for their products.
<p/>In exactly the same way, as the citizens of our Industrial Republic become refined, year by year the cost of slaughterhouse products will increase; until eventually those who want to eat meat will have to do their own killing--and how long do you think the custom would survive then?--To go on to another item--
<p/>one of the necessary accompaniments of capitalism in a democracy is political corruption; and one of the consequences of civic administration by ignorant and vicious politicians, is that preventable diseases kill off half our population.
<p/>And even if science were allowed to try, it could do little, because the majority of human beings are not yet human beings at all, but simply machines for the creating of wealth for others.
<p/>They are penned up in filthy houses and left to rot and stew in misery, and the conditions of their life make them ill faster than all the doctors in the world could heal them; and so, of course, they remain as centers of contagion, poisoning the lives of all of us, and making happiness impossible for even the most selfish.
<p/>For this reason I would seriously maintain that all the medical and surgical discoveries that science can make in the future will be of less importance than the application of the knowledge we already possess, when the disinherited of the earth have established their right to a human existence.
<p/>Jurgis had noticed that the beautiful young girl who sat by the center-table was listening with something of the same look that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) himself had worn, the time when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had first discovered Socialism.
<p/>'' And here the Herr Doctor relapsed into silence again. Jurgis would have liked to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) felt sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>).
<p/>Later on in the evening, when the group broke up, he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) heard Mrs. Fisher say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>), in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``I wonder if Mr. Maynard will still write the same things about Socialism'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>; to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fisher</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``I don't know--but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Maynard</b></font>) does we shall know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Maynard</b></font>) is a knave!
<p/>And only a few hours after this came election day--when the long campaign was over, and the whole country seemed to stand still and hold its breath, awaiting the issue.
<p/>Jurgis and the rest of the staff of Hinds's Hotel could hardly stop to finish their dinner, before they hurried off to the big hall which the party had hired for that evening.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But already there were people waiting, and already the telegraph instrument on the stage had begun clicking off the returns.
<p/>When the final accounts were made up, the Socialist vote proved to be over four hundred thousand--an increase of something like three hundred and fifty per cent in four years.
<p/>And that was doing well; but the party was dependent for its early returns upon messages from the locals, and naturally those locals which had been most successful were the ones which felt most like reporting; and so that night every one in the hall believed that the vote was going to be six, or seven, or even eight hundred thousand.
<p/>Just such an incredible increase had actually been made in Chicago, and in the state; the vote of the city had been 6,700 in 1900, and now it was 47,000; that of Illinois had been 9,600, and now it was 69,000!
<p/>Bulletins would be read, and the people would shout themselves hoarse--and then some one would make a speech, and there would be more shouting; and then a brief silence, and more bulletins.
<p/>There would come messages from the secretaries of neighboring states, reporting their achievements; the vote of Indiana had gone from 2,300 to 12,000, of Wisconsin from 7,000 to 28,000; of Ohio from 4,800 to 36,000!
<p/>There were telegrams to the national office from enthusiastic individuals in little towns which had made amazing and unprecedented increases in a single year: Benedict, Kansas, from 26 to 260; Henderson, Kentucky, from 19 to 111; Holland, Michigan, from 14 to 208; Cleo, Oklahoma, from 0 to 104; Martin's Ferry, Ohio, from 0 to 296--and many more of the same kind.
<p/>There were literally hundreds of such towns; there would be reports from half a dozen of them in a single batch of telegrams.
<p/>And the men who read the despatches off to the audience were old campaigners, who had been to the places and helped to make the vote, and could make appropriate comments: Quincy, Illinois, from 189 to 831--that was where the mayor had arrested a Socialist speaker!
<p/>So, as the evening waxed, and the crowd piled in, the meeting was a sight to be seen. Crawford County, Kansas, from 285 to 1,975; that was the home of the <div class="bookquote">``Appeal to Reason'' (<font color='red'><b>Crawford</b></font>)</div>!
<p/>Battle Creek, Michigan, from 4,261 to 10,184; that was the answer of labor to the Citizens' Alliance Movement! And then there were official returns from the various precincts and wards of the city itself!
<p/>Whether it was a factory district or one of the <div class="bookquote">``silk-stocking''  (<font color='red'><b>party</b></font>)</div>wards seemed to make no particular difference in the increase; but one of the things which surprised the party leaders most was the tremendous vote that came rolling in from the stockyards.
<p/>Packingtown comprised three wards of the city, and the vote in the spring of 1903 had been 500, and in the fall of the same year, 1,600.
<p/>There were other wards in which the Democratic vote had been actually surpassed, and in two districts, members of the state legislature had been elected.
<p/>Thus Chicago now led the country; it had set a new standard for the party, it had shown the workingmen the way!
<p/>spoke an orator upon the platform; and two thousand pairs of eyes were fixed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>), and two thousand voices were cheering his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) every sentence.
<p/>The orator had been the head of the city's relief bureau in the stockyards, until the sight of misery and corruption had made him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) sick.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was young, hungry-looking, full of fire; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) swung his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) long arms and beat up the crowd, to Jurgis he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) seemed the very spirit of the revolution.
<p/>Now, only one year later, it was over 6,300--and the Democratic vote only 8,800! --So '' Organize! Organize! Organize!''--that was his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) cry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was afraid of this tremendous vote, which his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) party had not expected, and which it had not earned. '' These men are not Socialists!
<p/>This election will pass, and the excitement will die, and people will forget about it; and if you forget about it, too, if you sink back and rest upon your oars, we shall lose this vote that we have polled to-day, and our enemies will laugh us to scorn!
<p/>It rests with you to take your resolution--now, in the flush of victory, to find these men who have voted for us, and bring them to our meetings, and organize them and bind them to us!
<p/>Everywhere in the country tonight the old party politicians are studying this vote, and setting their sails by it; and nowhere will they be quicker or more cunning than here in our own city.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) cried. '' We shall not find all our campaigns as easy as this one. Fifty thousand Socialist votes in Chicago means a municipal-ownership Democracy in the spring!
<p/>And then they will fool the voters once more, and all the powers of plunder and corruption will be swept into office again!
<p/>But whatever they may do when they get in, there is one thing they will not do, and that will be the thing for which they were elected!
<p/>They will not give the people of our city municipal ownership--they will not mean to do it, they will not try to do it; all that they will do is give our party in Chicago the greatest opportunity that has ever come to Socialism in America!
<p/>We shall have the sham reformers self-stultified and self-convicted; we shall have the radical Democracy left without a lie with which to cover its nakedness!
<p/>And then will begin the rush that will never be checked, the tide that will never turn till it has reached its flood--that will be irresistible, overwhelming--the rallying of the outraged workingmen of Chicago to our standard!
<p/>And we shall organize them, we shall drill them, we shall marshal them for the victory! We shall bear down the opposition, we shall sweep if before us--and Chicago will be ours!
