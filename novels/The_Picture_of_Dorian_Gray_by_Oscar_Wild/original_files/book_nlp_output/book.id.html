To reveal art and conceal the artist is art's aim.
<p/>The critic is he (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) who can translate into another manner or a new material his (<font color='blue'><b>critic</b></font>) impression of beautiful things. The highest as the lowest form of criticism is a mode of autobiography.
<p/>Those who find ugly meanings in beautiful things are corrupt without being charming. This is a fault. Those who find beautiful meanings in beautiful things are the cultivated.
<p/>For these there is hope. They are the elect to whom beautiful things mean only beauty. There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book.
<p/>Books are well written, or badly written. That is all. The nineteenth century dislike of realism is the rage of Caliban seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Caliban</b></font>) own face in a glass.
<p/>The moral life of man forms part of the subject-matter of the artist, but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium.
<p/>The nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of Caliban not seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) own face in a glass. No artist desires to prove anything.
<p/>Even things that are true can be proved. No artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style.
<p/>No artist is ever morbid. The artist can express everything. Thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art.
<p/>Vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art. From the point of view of form, the type of all the arts is the art of the musician.
<p/>From the point of view of feeling, the actor's craft is the type. All art is at once surface and symbol.
<p/>Those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril.
<p/>It is the spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital.
<p/>When critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself. We can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) does not admire it.
<p/>The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely. All art is quite useless. OSCAR WILDE CHAPTER 1
<p/>The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume of the pink-flowering thorn.
<p/>From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) was lying, smoking, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) custom, innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary Japanese effect, and making him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion.
<p/>The sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.
<p/>In the centre of the room, clamped to an upright easel, stood the full-length portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty, and in front of it, some little distance away, was sitting the artist himself, Basil Hallward, whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused, at the time, such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures.
<p/>As the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had so skilfully mirrored in his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) art, a smile of pleasure passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) face, and seemed about to linger there.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) suddenly started up, and closing his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) eyes, placed his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) fingers upon the lids, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) sought to imprison within his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) brain some curious dream from which he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) feared he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) might awake.
<p/>The dim roar of London was like the bourdon note of a distant organ. '' It is your best work, Basil, the best thing you have ever done,'' said Lord Henry languidly.
<p/>Whenever I have gone there, there have been either so many people that I have not been able to see the pictures, which was dreadful, or so many pictures that I have not been able to see the people, which was worse.
<p/>'' You must certainly send it next year to the Grosvenor. The Academy is too large and too vulgar. The Grosvenor is really the only place.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I shall send it anywhere,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered, tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) head back in that odd way that used to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) friends laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at Oxford.
<p/>Lord Henry elevated his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyebrows and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heavy, opium-tainted cigarette.
<p/>'' No, I won't send it anywhere. '' '' Not send it anywhere? My dear fellow, why? Have you any reason?
<p/>What odd chaps you painters are! You do anything in the world to gain a reputation. As soon as you have one, you seem to want to throw it away.
<p/>It is silly of you, for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.
<p/>A portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in England, and make the old men quite jealous, if old men are ever capable of any emotion.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know you will laugh at me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">``but I really can't exhibit it. I have put too much of myself into it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Lord Henry stretched himself out on the divan and laughed. '' Yes, I knew you would; but it is quite true, all the same.''
<p/>Upon my word, Basil, I didn't know you were so vain; and I really can't see any resemblance between you, with your rugged strong face and your coal-black hair, and this young Adonis, who looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Adonis</b></font>) was made out of ivory and rose-leaves.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too much of yourself in it! Why, my dear Basil, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) is a Narcissus, and you--well, of course you have an intellectual expression and all that.
<p/>But beauty, real beauty, ends where an intellectual expression begins. Intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration, and destroys the harmony of any face.
<p/>The moment one sits down to think, one becomes all nose, or all forehead, or something horrid. Look at the successful men in any of the learned professions.
<p/>A bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was told to say when he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) was a boy of eighteen, and as a natural consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>bishop</b></font>) always looks absolutely delightful.
<p/>How perfectly hideous they are! Except, of course, in the Church. But then in the Church they don't think. Your mysterious young friend, whose name you have never told me, but whose picture really fascinates me, never thinks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at, and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence.
<p/>I feel quite sure of that. Don't flatter yourself, Basil: you are not in the least like him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't understand me, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div>answered the artist.
<p/>'' Of course I am not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). I know that perfectly well. Indeed, I should be sorry to look like him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<p/>There is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction, the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings.
<p/>You shrug your shoulders? I am telling you the truth. It is better not to be different from one's fellows. The ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world.
<p/>They can sit at their ease and gape at the play. If they know nothing of victory, they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat.
<p/>They live as we all should live--undisturbed, indifferent, and without disquiet. They neither bring ruin upon others, nor ever receive it from alien hands.
<p/>Your rank and wealth, Harry; my brains, such as they are--my art, whatever it may be worth; Dorian Gray's good looks--we shall all suffer for what the gods have given us, suffer terribly.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Dorian Gray? Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) name? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>asked Lord Henry, walking across the studio towards Basil Hallward. '' Yes, that is his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) name.
<p/>I didn't intend to tell it to you.'' '' But why not?'' '' Oh, I can't explain. When I like people immensely, I never tell their names to any one.
<p/>It is like surrendering a part of them. I have grown to love secrecy. It seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us.
<p/>The commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it. When I leave town now I never tell my people where I am going.
<p/>It is a silly habit, I dare say, but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into one's life.
<p/>If I did, I would lose all my pleasure. I suppose you think me awfully foolish about it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry, ``not at all, my dear Basil.
<p/>You seem to forget that I am married, and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.
<p/>When we meet--we do meet occasionally, when we dine out together, or go down to the Duke's--we tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces.
<p/>I never know where my wife is, and my wife never knows what I am doing. My wife is very good at it--much better, in fact, than I am.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) never gets confused over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) dates, and I always do. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does find me out, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) makes no row at all.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hate the way you talk about your married life, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Basil Hallward, strolling towards the door that led into the garden.
<p/>I sometimes wish she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would; but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) merely laughs at me.'' '' I believe that you are really a very good husband, but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues.
<p/>You are an extraordinary fellow. You never say a moral thing, and you never do a wrong thing. Your cynicism is simply a pose.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Being natural is simply a pose, and the most irritating pose I know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, laughing; and the two young men went out into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush.
<p/>The sunlight slipped over the polished leaves. In the grass, white daisies were tremulous. After a pause, Lord Henry pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) watch.
<p/>I am afraid I must be going, Basil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``and before I go, I insist on your answering a question I put to you some time ago.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``What is that?''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) eyes fixed on the ground. '' You know quite well.'' <div class="bookquote">``I do not, Harry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, I will tell you what it is. I want you to explain to me why you won't exhibit Dorian Gray's picture.
<p/>I want the real reason. '' <div class="bookquote">``I told you the real reason.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, you did not. You said it was because there was too much of yourself in it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Basil Hallward, looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) straight in the face, <div class="bookquote">``every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist, not of the sitter.
<p/>It is not he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) who is revealed by the painter; it is rather the painter who, on the coloured canvas, reveals himself.
<p/>The reason I will not exhibit this picture is that I am afraid that I have shown in it the secret of my own soul.
<p/>Now, that is childish.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The sitter is merely the accident, the occasion. '' Lord Henry laughed. '' And what is that?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked.
<p/>'' I will tell you,'' said Hallward; but an expression of perplexity came over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) face. '' I am all expectation, Basil,'' continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) companion, glancing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>).
<p/>Oh, there is really very little to tell, Harry,'' answered the painter; <div class="bookquote">``and I am afraid you will hardly understand it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>Perhaps you will hardly believe it. '' Lord Henry smiled, and leaning down, plucked a pink-petalled daisy from the grass and examined it.
<p/>I am quite sure I shall understand it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) replied, gazing intently at the little golden, white-feathered disk, <div class="bookquote">``and as for believing things, I can believe anything, provided that it is quite incredible.
<p/>The wind shook some blossoms from the trees, and the heavy lilac-blooms, with their clustering stars, moved to and fro in the languid air.
<p/>A grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall, and like a blue thread a long thin dragon-fly floated past on its brown gauze wings.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Lord Henry felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could hear Basil Hallward's heart beating, and wondered what was coming. '' The story is simply this,'' said the painter after some time.
<p/>You know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time, just to remind the public that we are not savages.
<p/>With an evening coat and a white tie, as you told me once, anybody, even a stock-broker, can gain a reputation for being civilized.
<p/>Well, after I had been in the room about ten minutes, talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians, I suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me.
<p/>'' Two months ago I went to a crush at Lady Brandon's. I turned half-way round and saw Dorian Gray for the first time.
<p/>I knew that I had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that, if I allowed it to do so, it would absorb my whole nature, my whole soul, my very art itself.
<p/>When our eyes met, I felt that I was growing pale. A curious sensation of terror came over me. I did not want any external influence in my life.
<p/>You know yourself, Harry, how independent I am by nature. I have always been my own master; had at least always been so, till I met Dorian Gray.
<p/>Then--but I don't know how to explain it to you. Something seemed to tell me that I was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life.
<p/>I had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows. I grew afraid and turned to quit the room.
<p/>It was not conscience that made me do so : it was a sort of cowardice. I take no credit to myself for trying to escape.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Conscience and cowardice are really the same things, Basil. Conscience is the trade-name of the firm. That is all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe that, Harry, and I don't believe you do either.
<p/>However, whatever was my motive--and it may have been pride, for I used to be very proud-- I certainly struggled to the door.
<p/>There, of course, I stumbled against Lady Brandon. ' You are not going to run away so soon, Mr. Hallward?' she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) screamed out.
<p/>Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) is a peacock in everything but beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, pulling the daisy to bits with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) long nervous fingers.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) brought me up to royalties, and people with stars and garters, and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses.
<p/>You know her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) curiously shrill voice?'' '' '' I could not get rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) spoke of me as her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) dearest friend.
<p/>I believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time, at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers, which is the nineteenth-century standard of immortality.
<p/>I had only met her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) once before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) took it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) head to lionize me. Suddenly I found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me.
<p/>We were quite close, almost touching. Our eyes met again. It was reckless of me, but I asked Lady Brandon to introduce me to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Perhaps it was not so reckless, after all. It was simply inevitable. We would have spoken to each other without any introduction.
<p/>I am sure of that. Dorian told me so afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>), too, felt that we were destined to know each other.''
<p/>'' And how did Lady Brandon describe this wonderful young man?'' asked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) companion. '' I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) goes in for giving a rapid precis of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) guests.
<p/>I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) bringing me up to a truculent and red-faced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons, and hissing into my ear, in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room, the most astounding details.
<p/>I simply fled. I like to find out people for myself. But Lady Brandon treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) goods.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) either explains them entirely away, or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know. '' <div class="bookquote">``Poor Lady Brandon!
<p/>You are hard on her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward listlessly. '' My dear fellow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) tried to found a salon , and only succeeded in opening a restaurant.
<p/>How could I admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)? But tell me, what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) say about Mr. Dorian Gray?'' '' Oh, something like, `Charming boy--poor dear mother and I absolutely inseparable.
<p/>Quite forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does--afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--doesn't do anything--oh, yes, plays the piano--or is it the violin, dear Mr. Gray?' Neither of us could help laughing, and we became friends at once.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laughter is not at all a bad beginning for a friendship, and it is far the best ending for one,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lord</b></font>)</div>said the young lord, plucking another daisy.
<p/>'' Hallward shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) head. '' You don't understand what friendship is, Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) murmured--``or what enmity is, for that matter.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How horribly unjust of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, tilting his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hat back and looking up at the little clouds that, like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk, were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky.
<p/>You like every one; that is to say, you are indifferent to every one.'' '' Yes; horribly unjust of you. I make a great difference between people.
<p/>I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their good intellects.
<p/>A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enemies. I have not got one who is a fool.
<p/>They are all men of some intellectual power, and consequently they all appreciate me. Is that very vain of me? I think it is rather vain.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I should think it was, Harry. But according to your category I must be merely an acquaintance.''  (<font color='red'><b>Basil</b></font>)</div>'' My dear old Basil, you are much more than an acquaintance.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And much less than a friend. A sort of brother, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>brothers</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, brothers! I don't care for brothers. My elder brother won't die, and my younger brothers seem never to do anything else.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Hallward, frowning. '' My dear fellow, I am not quite serious. But I can't help detesting my relations.
<p/>I suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves.
<p/>The masses feel that drunkenness, stupidity, and immorality should be their own special property, and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is poaching on their preserves.
<p/>I quite sympathize with the rage of the English democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders. When poor Southwark got into the divorce court, their indignation was quite magnificent.
<p/>And yet I don't suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't agree with a single word that you have said, and,
<p/>what is more, Harry, I feel sure you don't either. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>Lord Henry stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) patent-leather boot with a tasselled ebony cane.
<p/>If one puts forward an idea to a true Englishman--always a rash thing to do--he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong.
<p/>'' How English you are Basil! That is the second time you have made that observation. The only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself.
<p/>Indeed, the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is, the more purely intellectual will the idea be, as in that case it will not be coloured by either his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) desires, or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) prejudices.
<p/>Now, the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it. However, I don't propose to discuss politics, sociology, or metaphysics with you.
<p/>I like persons better than principles, and I like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world. Tell me more about Mr. Dorian Gray.
<p/>How often do you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)?'' '' Every day. I couldn't be happy if I didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) every day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is absolutely necessary to me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How extraordinary! I thought you would never care for anything but your art.''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is all my art to me now,'' said the painter gravely.
<p/>The first is the appearance of a new medium for art, and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also.
<p/>What the invention of oil-painting was to the Venetians, the face of Antinous was to late Greek sculpture, and the face of Dorian Gray will some day be to me.
<p/>'' I sometimes think, Harry, that there are only two eras of any importance in the world's history. It is not merely that I paint from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), draw from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), sketch from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<p/>I won't tell you that I am dissatisfied with what I have done of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), or that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) beauty is such that art cannot express it.
<p/>There is nothing that art cannot express, and I know that the work I have done, since I met Dorian Gray, is good work, is the best work of my life.
<p/>But in some curious way--I wonder will you understand me?--his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art, an entirely new mode of style.
<p/>Of course, I have done all that. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is much more to me than a model or a sitter. I see things differently, I think of them differently.
<p/>I can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before. ' A dream of form in days of thought'--who is it who says that?
<p/>The merely visible presence of this lad--for he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) seems to me little more than a lad, though he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is really over twenty--his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) merely visible presence--ah!
<p/>I forget; but it is what Dorian Gray has been to me. I wonder can you realize all that that means?
<p/>Unconsciously he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) defines for me the lines of a fresh school, a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit, all the perfection of the spirit that is Greek.
<p/>We in our madness have separated the two, and have invented a realism that is vulgar, an ideality that is void.
<p/>You remember that landscape of mine, for which Agnew offered me such a huge price but which I would not part with?
<p/>The harmony of soul and body--how much that is! Harry! if you only knew what Dorian Gray is to me! It is one of the best things I have ever done.
<p/>Some subtle influence passed from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to me, and for the first time in my life I saw in the plain woodland the wonder I had always looked for and always missed.''
<p/>And why is it so? Because, while I was painting it, Dorian Gray sat beside me. '' Basil, this is extraordinary!
<p/>I must see Dorian Gray. '' Hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden. After some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) came back.
<p/>'' Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Dorian Gray is to me simply a motive in art. You might see nothing in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). I see everything in him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is never more present in my work than when no image of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is a suggestion, as I have said, of a new manner.
<p/>I find him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) in the curves of certain lines, in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours. That is all.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Because, without intending it, I have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry, of which, of course, I have never cared to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>Then why won't you exhibit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) portrait?'' asked Lord Henry. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) knows nothing about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) shall never know anything about it.
<p/>But the world might guess it, and I will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes. My heart shall never be put under their microscope.
<p/>There is too much of myself in the thing, Harry--too much of myself!'' <div class="bookquote">``Poets are not so scrupulous as you are.
<p/>They know how useful passion is for publication. Nowadays a broken heart will run to many editions. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hate them for it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried Hallward.
<p/>'' An artist should create beautiful things, but should put nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) own life into them. We live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography.
<p/>Some day I will show the world what it is; and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of Dorian Gray.''
<p/>We have lost the abstract sense of beauty. <div class="bookquote">``I think you are wrong, Basil, but I won't argue with you. It is only the intellectually lost who ever argue.
<p/>Tell me, is Dorian Gray very fond of you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>The painter</b></font>)</div>The painter considered for a few moments. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) likes me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) answered after a pause; <div class="bookquote">``I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) likes me.
<p/>Of course I flatter him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) dreadfully. I find a strange pleasure in saying things to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that I know I shall be sorry for having said.
<p/>As a rule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is charming to me, and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things. Now and then, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is horribly thoughtless, and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain.
<p/>Then I feel, Harry, that I have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) coat, a bit of decoration to charm his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) vanity, an ornament for a summer's day.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Days in summer, Basil, are apt to linger,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry. '' Perhaps you will tire sooner than he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will. It is a sad thing to think of, but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty.
<p/>In the wild struggle for existence, we want to have something that endures, and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts, in the silly hope of keeping our place.
<p/>That accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to over-educate ourselves. The thoroughly well-informed man--that is the modern ideal.
<p/>And the mind of the thoroughly well-informed man is a dreadful thing. It is like a bric-a-brac shop, all monsters and dust, with everything priced above its proper value.
<p/>Some day you will look at your friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) will seem to you to be a little out of drawing, or you won't like his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) tone of colour, or something.
<p/>I think you will tire first, all the same. You will bitterly reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in your own heart, and seriously think that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has behaved very badly to you.
<p/>The next time he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) calls, you will be perfectly cold and indifferent. It will be a great pity, for it will alter you.
<p/>What you have told me is quite a romance, a romance of art one might call it, and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry, don't talk like that. As long as I live, the personality of Dorian Gray will dominate me. You can't feel what I feel.
<p/>You change too often.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear Basil, that is exactly why I can feel it. Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.
<p/>And Lord Henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a self-conscious and satisfied air, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had summed up the world in a phrase.
<p/>There was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy, and the blue cloud-shadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How pleasant it was in the garden! And how delightful other people's emotions were!--much more delightful than their ideas, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had missed by staying so long with Basil Hallward.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) aunt's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would have been sure to have met Lord Goodbody there, and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodging-houses.
<p/>Each class would have preached the importance of those virtues, for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives.
<p/>One's own soul, and the passions of one's friends--those were the fascinating things in life. The rich would have spoken on the value of thrift, and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour.
<p/>It was charming to have escaped all that! As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) aunt, an idea seemed to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) turned to Hallward and said, <div class="bookquote">``My dear fellow, I have just remembered.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Remembered what, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where I heard the name of Dorian Gray. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where was it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>asked Hallward, with a slight frown.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) in the East End, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) name was Dorian Gray.
<p/>'' Don't look so angry, Basil. It was at my aunt, Lady Agatha's. I am bound to state that she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) never told me
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was good-looking. Women have no appreciation of good looks; at least, good women have not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was very earnest and had a beautiful nature.
<p/>I at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair, horribly freckled, and tramping about on huge feet.
<p/>I wish I had known it was your friend.'' <div class="bookquote">``I am very glad you didn't, Harry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want you to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't want me to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Dorian Gray is in the studio, sir,'' said the butler, coming into the garden.
<p/>'' You must introduce me now,'' cried Lord Henry, laughing. The painter turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) servant, who stood blinking in the sunlight.
<p/>'' Ask Mr. Gray to wait, Parker: I shall be in in a few moments. '' The man bowed and went up the walk.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked at Lord Henry. '' Dorian Gray is my dearest friend,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) said. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) has a simple and a beautiful nature.
<p/>Your aunt was quite right in what she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Don't spoil him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Don't try to influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Your influence would be bad.
<p/>Don't take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses: my life as an artist depends on him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>).
<p/>The world is wide, and has many marvellous people in it. Mind, Harry, I trust you. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spoke very slowly, and the words seemed wrung out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) almost against his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will.
<p/>What nonsense you talk!'' said Lord Henry, smiling, and taking Hallward by the arm, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) almost led him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) into the house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was seated at the piano, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) back to them, turning over the pages of a volume of Schumann's <div class="bookquote">``Forest Scenes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Schumann</b></font>)</div><p/>'' CHAPTER 2 As they entered they saw Dorian Gray. <div class="bookquote">``You must lend me these, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) cried. '' I want to learn them.
<p/>Oh, I am tired of sitting, and I don't want a life-sized portrait of myself,'' answered the lad, swinging round on the music-stool in a wilful, petulant manner.
<p/>They are perfectly charming.'' '' That entirely depends on how you sit to-day, Dorian.'' '' When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) caught sight of Lord Henry, a faint blush coloured his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cheeks for a moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) started up.
<p/>'' I beg your pardon, Basil, but I didn't know you had any one with you.'' '' This is Lord Henry Wotton, Dorian, an old Oxford friend of mine.
<p/>I have just been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) what a capital sitter you were, and now you have spoiled everything.'' <div class="bookquote">``You have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you, Mr. Gray,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, stepping forward and extending his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' My aunt has often spoken to me about you. You are one of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) favourites, and, I am afraid, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) victims also.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I am in Lady Agatha's black books at present,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>answered Dorian with a funny look of penitence. '' I promised to go to a club in Whitechapel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) last Tuesday, and I really forgot all about it.
<p/>We were to have played a duet together--three duets, I believe. I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) will say to me. I am far too frightened to call.
<p/>'' '' Oh, I will make your peace with my aunt. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is quite devoted to you. And I don't think it really matters about your not being there.
<p/>The audience probably thought it was a duet. When Aunt Agatha sits down to the piano, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) makes quite enough noise for two people.''
<p/>'' That is very horrid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>), and not very nice to me,'' answered Dorian, laughing. Lord Henry looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was certainly wonderfully handsome, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) finely curved scarlet lips, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) frank blue eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) crisp gold hair. There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) face that made one trust him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at once.
<p/>All the candour of youth was there, as well as all youth's passionate purity. One felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had kept himself unspotted from the world.
<p/>No wonder Basil Hallward worshipped him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). '' You are too charming to go in for philanthropy, Mr. Gray--far too charming. ''
<p/>And Lord Henry flung himself down on the divan and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cigarette-case. The painter had been busy mixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) colours and getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brushes ready.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was looking worried, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heard Lord Henry's last remark, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), hesitated for a moment, and then said, <div class="bookquote">``Harry, I want to finish this picture to-day.
<p/>Would you think it awfully rude of me if I asked you to go away? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Lord Henry smiled and looked at Dorian Gray.
<p/>'' Am I to go, Mr. Gray? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) asked. '' Oh, please don't, Lord Henry. I see that Basil is in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sulky moods, and I can't bear him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sulks.
<p/>Besides, I want you to tell me why I should not go in for philanthropy. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know that I shall tell you that, Mr. Gray.
<p/>It is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it. But I certainly shall not run away, now that you have asked me to stop.
<p/>You don't really mind, Basil, do you? You have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) lip. '' If Dorian wishes it, of course you must stay. Dorian's whims are laws to everybody, except himself.
<p/>'' Lord Henry took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hat and gloves. '' You are very pressing, Basil, but I am afraid I must go.
<p/>I have promised to meet a man at the Orleans. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Come and see me some afternoon in Curzon Street.
<p/>I am nearly always at home at five o'clock. Write to me when you are coming. I should be sorry to miss you.''
<p/>You never open your lips while you are painting, and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray, <div class="bookquote">``if Lord Henry Wotton goes, I shall go, too. Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) to stay. I insist upon it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><p/>It is quite true, I never talk when I am working, and never listen either, and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stay, Harry, to oblige Dorian, and to oblige me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward, gazing intently at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) picture. '' I beg you to stay.''
<p/>'' But what about my man at the Orleans? '' The painter laughed. '' I don't think there will be any difficulty about that.
<p/>And now, Dorian, get up on the platform, and don't move about too much, or pay any attention to what Lord Henry says.
<p/>Sit down again, Harry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has a very bad influence over all his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) friends, with the single exception of myself. ''
<p/>Dorian Gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young Greek martyr, and made a little moue of discontent to Lord Henry, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had rather taken a fancy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was so unlike Basil. They made a delightful contrast. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had such a beautiful voice. After a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``Have you really a very bad influence, Lord Henry?
<p/>As bad as Basil says?''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' There is no such thing as a good influence, Mr. Gray. All influence is immoral--immoral from the scientific point of view.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>'' Because to influence a person is to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) one's own soul. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) does not think his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) natural thoughts, or burn with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) natural passions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) becomes an echo of some one else's music, an actor of a part that has not been written for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) virtues are not real to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) sins, if there are such things as sins, are borrowed. The aim of life is self-development.
<p/>To realize one's nature perfectly--that is what each of us is here for. People are afraid of themselves, nowadays. They have forgotten the highest of all duties, the duty that one owes to one's self.
<p/>Of course, they are charitable. They feed the hungry and clothe the beggar. But their own souls starve, and are naked.
<p/>The terror of society, which is the basis of morals, the terror of God, which is the secret of religion--these are the two things that govern us.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Just turn your head a little more to the right, Dorian, like a good boy,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter, deep in his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) work and conscious only that a look had come into the lad's face that he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had never seen there before.
<p/>And yet,'' continued Lord Henry, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) low, musical voice, and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had even in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) Eton days, <div class="bookquote">``I believe that if one man were to live out his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life fully and completely, were to give form to every feeling, expression to every thought, reality to every dream
<p/>--I believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of mediaevalism, and return to the Hellenic ideal--to something finer, richer than the Hellenic ideal, it may be.
<p/>Courage has gone out of our race. Perhaps we never really had it. And yet-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself.
<p/>The mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the self-denial that mars our lives. We are punished for our refusals.
<p/>Every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us. The body sins once, and has done with its sin, for action is a mode of purification.
<p/>Nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure, or the luxury of a regret. The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it.
<p/>Resist it, and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself, with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful.
<p/>It has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain. It is in the brain, and the brain only, that the great sins of the world take place also.
<p/>You, Mr. Gray, you yourself, with your rose-red youth and your rose-white boyhood, you have had passions that have made you afraid, thoughts that have filled you with terror, day-dreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame--'' <div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>youth boyhood</b></font>)</div>faltered Dorian Gray, <div class="bookquote">``stop!
<p/>you bewilder me. I don't know what to say. There is some answer to you, but I cannot find it. Don't speak.
<p/>Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>For nearly ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stood there, motionless, with parted lips and eyes strangely bright.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Yet they seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to have come really from himself.
<p/>The few words that Basil's friend had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--words spoken by chance, no doubt, and with wilful paradox in them--had touched some secret chord that had never been touched before, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses.
<p/>Music had stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) like that. Music had troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) many times. But music was not articulate. It was not a new world, but rather another chaos, that it created in us.
<p/>Words! Mere words! How terrible they were! How clear, and vivid, and cruel! One could not escape from them. And yet what a subtle magic there was in them!
<p/>They seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things, and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute.
<p/>Mere words! Was there anything so real as words? Yes; there had been things in his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) boyhood that he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had not understood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) understood them now. Life suddenly became fiery-coloured to him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>). It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) had been walking in fire.
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) not known it? With his (<font color='blue'><b>They</b></font>) subtle smile, Lord Henry watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was amazed at the sudden impression that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) words had produced, and, remembering a book that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had read when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was sixteen, a book which had revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) much that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had not known before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wondered whether Dorian Gray was passing through a similar experience.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt intensely interested. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had merely shot an arrow into the air. Had it hit the mark? How fascinating the lad was!
<p/>Hallward painted away with that marvellous bold touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), that had the true refinement and perfect delicacy that in art, at any rate comes only from strength.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was unconscious of the silence. '' Basil, I am tired of standing,'' cried Dorian Gray suddenly. '' I must go out and sit in the garden.
<p/>The air is stifling here.'' '' My dear fellow, I am so sorry. When I am painting, I can't think of anything else.
<p/>But you never sat better. You were perfectly still. And I have caught the effect I wanted--the half-parted lips and the bright look in the eyes.
<p/>I don't know what Harry has been saying to you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression.
<p/>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has been paying you compliments. You mustn't believe a word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) says. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has certainly not been paying me compliments.
<p/>Perhaps that is the reason that I don't believe anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has told me.'' <div class="bookquote">``You know you believe it all,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) dreamy languorous eyes.
<p/>'' I will go out to the garden with you. It is horribly hot in the studio. Basil, let us have something iced to drink, something with strawberries in it.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Certainly, Harry. Just touch the bell, and when Parker comes I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Parker</b></font>) what you want. I have got to work up this background, so I will join you later on.
<p/>Don't keep Dorian too long. I have never been in better form for painting than I am to-day. This is going to be my masterpiece.
<p/>Lord Henry went out to the garden and found Dorian Gray burying his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) face in the great cool lilac-blossoms, feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine.
<p/>It is my masterpiece as it stands. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) came close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) shoulder. ''
<p/>You are quite right to do that,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) murmured. '' Nothing can cure the soul but the senses, just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul.
<p/>'' The lad started and drew back. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was bareheaded, and the leaves had tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads.
<p/>There was a look of fear in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) eyes, such as people have when they are suddenly awakened. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) finely chiselled nostrils quivered, and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) lips and left them trembling.
<p/>Yes,'' continued Lord Henry, <div class="bookquote">``that is one of the great secrets of life--to cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>You are a wonderful creation. You know more than you think you know, just as you know less than you want to know.
<p/>'' Dorian Gray frowned and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) could not help liking the tall, graceful young man who was standing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) romantic, olive-coloured face and worn expression interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). There was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cool, white, flowerlike hands, even, had a curious charm. They moved, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) spoke, like music, and seemed to have a language of their own.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), and ashamed of being afraid. Why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) to himself?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had known Basil Hallward for months, but the friendship between them had never altered him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>). Suddenly there had come some one across his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) life who seemed to have disclosed to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) life's mystery.
<p/>And, yet, what was there to be afraid of? He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) was not a schoolboy or a girl. It was absurd to be frightened.
<p/>Parker has brought out the drinks, and if you stay any longer in this glare, you will be quite spoiled, and Basil will never paint you again.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go and sit in the shade,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. '' You really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt.
<p/>It would be unbecoming. '' <div class="bookquote">``What can it matter? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray, laughing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) sat down on the seat at the end of the garden.
<p/>'' It should matter everything to you, Mr. Gray. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because you have the most marvellous youth, and youth is the one thing worth having.
<p/>Some day, when you are old and wrinkled and ugly, when thought has seared your forehead with its lines, and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires, you will feel it, you will feel it terribly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel that, Lord Henry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, you don't feel it now. Now, wherever you go, you charm the world.
<p/>Will it always be so? ... You have a wonderfully beautiful face, Mr. Gray. Don't frown. You have. And beauty is a form of genius--is higher, indeed, than genius, as it needs no explanation.
<p/>It is of the great facts of the world, like sunlight, or spring-time, or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon.
<p/>It cannot be questioned. It has its divine right of sovereignty. It makes princes of those who have it. You smile?
<p/>Ah! when you have lost it you won't smile.... People say sometimes that beauty is only superficial. That may be so, but at least it is not so superficial as thought is.
<p/>To me, beauty is the wonder of wonders. It is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances. The true mystery of the world is the visible, not the invisible....
<p/>Yes, Mr. Gray, the gods have been good to you. But what the gods give they quickly take away. You have only a few years in which to live really, perfectly, and fully.
<p/>When your youth goes, your beauty will go with it, and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you, or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats.
<p/>Every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful. Time is jealous of you, and wars against your lilies and your roses.
<p/>Don't squander the gold of your days, listening to the tedious, trying to improve the hopeless failure, or giving away your life to the ignorant, the common, and the vulgar.
<p/>You will become sallow, and hollow-cheeked, and dull-eyed. You will suffer horribly.... Ah! realize your youth while you have it. These are the sickly aims, the false ideals, of our age.
<p/>Live! Live the wonderful life that is in you! Let nothing be lost upon you. Be always searching for new sensations.
<p/>Be afraid of nothing.... A new Hedonism--that is what our century wants. You might be its visible symbol. With your personality there is nothing you could not do.
<p/>The world belongs to you for a season.... The moment I met you I saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are, of what you really might be.
<p/>There was so much in you that charmed me that I felt I must tell you something about yourself. I thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted.
<p/>For there is such a little time that your youth will last--such a little time. The common hill-flowers wither, but they blossom again.
<p/>In a month there will be purple stars on the clematis, and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars.
<p/>The laburnum will be as yellow next June as it is now. But we never get back our youth. The pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish.
<p/>We degenerate into hideous puppets, haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid, and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to.
<p/>Our limbs fail, our senses rot. Youth! Youth! There is absolutely nothing in the world but youth!'' Dorian Gray listened, open-eyed and wondering.
<p/>The spray of lilac fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand upon the gravel. A furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid, or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression, or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield.
<p/>Then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms. After a time the bee flew away.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a Tyrian convolvulus. The flower seemed to quiver, and then swayed gently to and fro.
<p/>Suddenly the painter appeared at the door of the studio and made staccato signs for them to come in. They turned to each other and smiled.
<p/>'' I am waiting,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) cried. '' Do come in. The light is quite perfect, and you can bring your drinks.
<p/>Two green-and-white butterflies fluttered past them, and in the pear-tree at the corner of the garden a thrush began to sing.
<p/>'' They rose up and sauntered down the walk together. '' You are glad you have met me, Mr. Gray,'' said Lord Henry, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>'' Yes, I am glad now. I wonder shall I always be glad?'' <div class="bookquote">``Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.
<p/>Women are so fond of using it. They spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever. It is a meaningless word, too.
<p/>The only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>As they entered the studio, Dorian Gray put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand upon Lord Henry's arm.
<p/>In that case, let our friendship be a caprice,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) murmured, flushing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own boldness, then stepped up on the platform and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) pose.
<p/>The sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness, except when, now and then, Hallward stepped back to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) work from a distance.
<p/>'' Lord Henry flung himself into a large wicker arm-chair and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). In the slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden.
<p/>Hallward stopped painting, looked for a long time at Dorian Gray, and then for a long time at the picture, biting the end of one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) huge brushes and frowning.
<p/>The heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything. After about a quarter of an hour '' It is quite finished,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cried at last, and stooping down
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wrote his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) name in long vermilion letters on the left-hand corner of the canvas. Lord Henry came over and examined the picture.
<p/>It was certainly a wonderful work of art, and a wonderful likeness as well. '' My dear fellow, I congratulate you most warmly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' It is the finest portrait of modern times. Mr. Gray, come over and look at yourself. '' The lad started, as if awakened from some dream.
<p/>'' Is it really finished? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) murmured, stepping down from the platform. '' Quite finished,'' said the painter. '' And you have sat splendidly to-day.
<p/>I am awfully obliged to you.'' <div class="bookquote">``That is entirely due to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>broke in Lord Henry. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it, Mr. Gray?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>Dorian made no answer, but passed listlessly in front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) picture and turned towards it.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) saw it he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) drew back, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure. A look of joy came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) eyes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had recognized himself for the first time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) stood there motionless and in wonder, dimly conscious that Hallward was speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), but not catching the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) words.
<p/>The sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own beauty came on him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) like a revelation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had never felt it before. Basil Hallward's compliments had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had listened to them, laughed at them, forgotten them. They had not influenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) nature. Then had come Lord Henry Wotton with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) strange panegyric on youth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) terrible warning of its brevity.
<p/>That had stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) at the time, and now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) stood gazing at the shadow of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own loveliness, the full reality of the description flashed across him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>).
<p/>Yes, there would be a day when his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) face would be wrinkled and wizen , his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) eyes dim and colourless, the grace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) figure broken and deformed.
<p/>The scarlet would pass away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) lips and the gold steal from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hair. The life that was to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) soul would mar his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) body.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) thought of it, a sharp pang of pain struck through him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) like a knife and made each delicate fibre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) nature quiver.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would become dreadful, hideous, and uncouth. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) eyes deepened into amethyst, and across them came a mist of tears. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) heart.
<p/>'' Don't you like it? '' cried Hallward at last, stung a little by the lad's silence, not understanding what it meant.
<p/>'' Of course he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) likes it,'' said Lord Henry. '' Who wouldn't like it? It is one of the greatest things in modern art.
<p/>I will give you anything you like to ask for it. I must have it.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is not my property, Harry.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Whose property is it?'' '' Dorian's, of course,'' answered the painter. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is a very lucky fellow. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How sad it is! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>murmured Dorian Gray with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes still fixed upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own portrait. '' How sad it is!
<p/>I shall grow old, and horrible, and dreadful. But this picture will remain always young. It will never be older than this particular day of June....
<p/>If it were only the other way! If it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that was to grow old!
<p/>For that--for that--I would give everything! Yes, there is nothing in the whole world I would not give! I would give my soul for that!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would hardly care for such an arrangement, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, laughing. '' It would be rather hard lines on your work.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I should object very strongly, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward. Dorian Gray turned and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). '' I believe you would, Basil.
<p/>You like your art better than your friends. I am no more to you than a green bronze figure. Hardly as much, I dare say.
<p/>'' The painter stared in amazement. It was so unlike Dorian to speak like that. What had happened? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) seemed quite angry.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) face was flushed and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cheeks burning. '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I am less to you than your ivory Hermes or your silver Faun.
<p/>You will like them always. How long will you like me? Till I have my first wrinkle, I suppose. I know, now, that when one loses one's good looks, whatever they may be, one loses everything.
<p/>Your picture has taught me that. Lord Henry Wotton is perfectly right. Youth is the only thing worth having. When I find that I am growing old, I shall kill myself.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Hallward turned pale and caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hand. '' Dorian! Dorian! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``don't talk like that. I have never had such a friend as you, and I shall never have such another.
<p/>You are not jealous of material things, are you?--you who are finer than any of them!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die.
<p/>I am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me. Why should it keep what I must lose? Every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it.
<p/>Oh, if it were only the other way! If the picture could change, and I could be always what I am now!
<p/>The hot tears welled into his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) tore his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hand away and, flinging himself on the divan, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) buried his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face in the cushions, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was praying.
<p/>Why did you paint it? It will mock me some day--mock me horribly! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>'' This is your doing, Harry,'' said the painter bitterly.
<p/>Lord Henry shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. '' It is the real Dorian Gray--that is all.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is not.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' If it is not, what have I to do with it?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should have gone away when I asked you,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) muttered. '' I stayed when you asked me,'' was Lord Henry's answer.
<p/>Harry, I can't quarrel with my two best friends at once, but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work I have ever done, and I will destroy it.
<p/>'' What is it but canvas and colour? I will not let it come across our three lives and mar them.
<p/>Dorian Gray lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) golden head from the pillow, and with pallid face and tear-stained eyes, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) walked over to the deal painting-table that was set beneath the high curtained window.
<p/>'' What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) doing there? His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) fingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes, seeking for something.
<p/>Yes, it was for the long palette-knife, with its thin blade of lithe steel. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had found it at last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was going to rip up the canvas.
<p/>With a stifled sob the lad leaped from the couch, and, rushing over to Hallward, tore the knife out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hand, and flung it to the end of the studio.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you appreciate my work at last, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter coldly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had recovered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) surprise.
<p/>'' Don't, Basil, don't! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) cried. '' It would be murder!'' '' I never thought you would. '' <div class="bookquote">``Appreciate it?
<p/>I am in love with it, Basil. It is part of myself. I feel that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, as soon as you are dry, you shall be varnished, and framed, and sent home.
<p/>Then you can do what you like with yourself. '' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) walked across the room and rang the bell for tea.
<p/>'' You will have tea, of course, Dorian? And so will you, Harry? Or do you object to such simple pleasures?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I adore simple pleasures,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. '' They are the last refuge of the complex. But I don't like scenes, except on the stage.
<p/>What absurd fellows you are, both of you! I wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal. It was the most premature definition ever given.
<p/>Man is many things, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is not rational. I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is not, after all--though I wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you let any one have it but me, Basil, I shall never forgive you!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray; <div class="bookquote">``and I don't allow people to call me a silly boy.
<p/>You had much better let me have it, Basil. This silly boy doesn't really want it, and I really do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>And you know you have been a little silly, Mr. Gray, and that you don't really object to being reminded that you are extremely young.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You know the picture is yours, Dorian. I gave it to you before it existed.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I should have objected very strongly this morning, Lord Henry.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div><p/>There came a knock at the door, and the butler entered with a laden tea-tray and set it down upon a small Japanese table.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! this morning! You have lived since then. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted Georgian urn.
<p/>Two globe-shaped china dishes were brought in by a page. Dorian Gray went over and poured out the tea. The two men sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was under the covers.
<p/>I have promised to dine at White's, but it is only with an old friend, so I can send him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) a wire to say that I am ill, or that I am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go to the theatre to-night,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. '' There is sure to be something on, somewhere. I think that would be a rather nice excuse: it would have all the surprise of candour.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``It is such a bore putting on one's dress-clothes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>muttered Hallward. '' And, when one has them on, they are so horrid.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry dreamily, <div class="bookquote">``the costume of the nineteenth century is detestable.

 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You really must not say things like that before Dorian, Harry. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>'' Before which Dorian? The one who is pouring out tea for us, or the one in the picture?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Before either.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't, really. I would sooner not. I have a lot of work to do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, then, you and I will go alone, Mr. Gray.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should like that awfully. ''  (<font color='red'><b>painter</b></font>)</div>The painter bit his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) lip and walked over, cup in hand, to the picture. ''
<p/>I shall stay with the real Dorian,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said, sadly. '' Is it the real Dorian? '' cried the original of the portrait, strolling across to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).

<p/>'' Why, even in love it is purely a question for physiology. It has nothing to do with our own will.
<p/>Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.

<p/>'' The lad hesitated, and looked over at Lord Henry, who was watching them from the tea-table with an amused smile.
<p/>'' I must go, Basil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) answered. '' Very well,'' said Hallward, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) went over and laid down his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) cup on the tray.

<p/>As the door closed behind them, the painter flung himself down on a sofa, and a look of pain came into his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) face.
<p/>Lord Henry Wotton strolled from Curzon Street over to the Albany to call on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) uncle, Lord Fermor, a genial if somewhat rough-mannered old bachelor, whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>), but who was considered generous by Society as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) fed the people who amused him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) father had been our ambassador at Madrid when Isabella was young and Prim unthought of, but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the Embassy at Paris, a post to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) considered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) was fully entitled by reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) birth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) indolence, the good English of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) dispatches, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) inordinate passion for pleasure.
<p/>The son, who had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) father's secretary, had resigned along with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) chief, somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time, and on succeeding some months later to the title, had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) had two large town houses, but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble, and took most of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) meals at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) club.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) paid some attention to the management of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) collieries in the Midland counties, excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own hearth.
<p/>In politics he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a Tory, except when the Tories were in office, during which period he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) roundly abused them for being a pack of Radicals.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a hero to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) valet, who bullied him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and a terror to most of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) relations, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bullied in turn.
<p/>Good-bye, Basil. It has been a most interesting afternoon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER 3 At half-past twelve next day Only England could have produced him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) always said that the country was going to the dogs.
<p/>When Lord Henry entered the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) uncle sitting in a rough shooting-coat, smoking a cheroot and grumbling over The Times .
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) principles were out of date, but there was a good deal to be said for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) prejudices. '' Well, Harry,'' said the old gentleman, <div class="bookquote">``what brings you out so early?
<p/>I thought you dandies never got up till two, and were not visible till five. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pure family affection, I assure you, Uncle George.
<p/>I want to get something out of you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Money, I suppose,'' said Lord Fermor, making a wry face. '' Well, sit down and tell me all about it.
<p/>Young people, nowadays, imagine that money is everything.'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry, settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) button-hole in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) coat; <div class="bookquote">``and when they grow older they know it.
<p/>But I don't want money. It is only people who pay their bills who want that, Uncle George, and I never pay mine.
<p/>Credit is the capital of a younger son, and one lives charmingly upon it. Besides, I always deal with Dartmoor's tradesmen, and consequently they never bother me.
<p/>Well, I can tell you anything that is in an English Blue Book, Harry, although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense.
<p/>What I want is information: not useful information, of course; useless information. ''  (<font color='red'><b>button-hole</b></font>)</div>'' When I was in the Diplomatic, things were much better.
<p/>But I hear they let them in now by examination. What can you expect? Examinations, sir, are pure humbug from beginning to end.
<p/>If a man is a gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows quite enough, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is not a gentleman, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knows is bad for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).''
<p/>'' Mr. Dorian Gray does not belong to Blue Books, Uncle George,'' said Lord Henry languidly. '' Mr. Dorian Gray? Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)?
<p/>'' asked Lord Fermor, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Fermor</b></font>) bushy white eyebrows. '' That is what I have come to learn, Uncle George. Or rather, I know who he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) is the last Lord Kelso's grandson. His (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother was a Devereux, Lady Margaret Devereux. I want you to tell me about his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) mother.
<p/>What was she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) like? Whom did she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) marry? You have known nearly everybody in your time, so you might have known her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>I am very much interested in Mr. Gray at present. I have only just met him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Kelso's grandson!''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>echoed the old gentleman.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was an extraordinarily beautiful girl, Margaret Devereux, and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellow--a mere nobody, sir, a subaltern in a foot regiment, or something of that kind.
<p/>'' Kelso's grandson! ... Of course.... I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) mother intimately. I believe I was at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) christening. Certainly. I remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday.
<p/>The poor chap was killed in a duel at Spa a few months after the marriage. There was an ugly story about it.
<p/>They said Kelso got some rascally adventurer, some Belgian brute, to insult his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) son-in-law in public--paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>), sir, to do it, paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>)--and that the fellow spitted his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) man as if he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been a pigeon.
<p/>The thing was hushed up, but, egad, Kelso ate his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) chop alone at the club for some time afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) daughter back with him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>), I was told, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) never spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) again.
<p/>Oh, yes; it was a bad business. The girl died, too, died within a year. So she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) left a son, did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?
<p/>I had forgotten that. What sort of boy is he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)? If he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is like his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) must be a good-looking chap.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is very good-looking,'' assented Lord Henry. '' I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will fall into proper hands,'' continued the old man.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have a pot of money waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if Kelso did the right thing by him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) mother had money, too.
<p/>All the Selby property came to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), through her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandfather. Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grandfather hated Kelso, thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) a mean dog. He (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) was, too.
<p/>Came to Madrid once when I was there. Egad, I was ashamed of him (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>). The Queen used to ask me about the English noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares.
<p/>They made quite a story of it. I didn't dare show my face at Court for a month. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) treated his (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) grandson better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Kelso</b></font>) did the jarvies.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry. '' I fancy that the boy will be well off. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is not of age yet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has Selby, I know. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) told me so. And ... his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother was very beautiful?'' <div class="bookquote">``Margaret Devereux was one of the loveliest creatures I ever saw, Harry.
<p/>What on earth induced her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to behave as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did, I never could understand. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could have married anybody she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chose.
<p/>Carlington was mad after her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was romantic, though. All the women of that family were. The men were a poor lot, but, egad!
<p/>the women were wonderful. Carlington went on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) knees to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Told me so himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), and there wasn't a girl in London at the time who wasn't after him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<p/>And by the way, Harry, talking about silly marriages, what is this humbug your father tells me about Dartmoor wanting to marry an American?
<p/>Ain't English girls good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is rather fashionable to marry Americans just now, Uncle George.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I'll back English women against the world, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Fermor</b></font>)</div>said Lord Fermor, striking the table with his (<font color='blue'><b>Fermor</b></font>) fist.
<p/>'' The betting is on the Americans.'' '' They don't last, I am told,'' muttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Fermor</b></font>) uncle. '' A long engagement exhausts them, but they are capital at a steeplechase.
<p/>They take things flying. I don't think Dartmoor has a chance. '' '' Who are her (<font color='blue'><b>Americans</b></font>) people? '' grumbled the old gentleman.
<p/>American girls are as clever at concealing their parents, as English women are at concealing their past,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) said, rising to go.
<p/>'' Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Americans</b></font>) got any? '' Lord Henry shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) head. '' '' They are pork-packers, I suppose?'' <div class="bookquote">``I hope so, Uncle George, for Dartmoor's sake.
<p/>I am told that pork-packing is the most lucrative profession in America, after politics.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Americans</b></font>) pretty?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Americans</b></font>) behaves as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Americans</b></font>) was beautiful.
<p/>Most American women do. It is the secret of their charm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why can't these American women stay in their own country?
<p/>They are always telling us that it is the paradise for women.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is. That is the reason why, like Eve, they are so excessively anxious to get out of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry.
<p/>'' Good-bye, Uncle George. I shall be late for lunch, if I stop any longer. Thanks for giving me the information I wanted.
<p/>I always like to know everything about my new friends, and nothing about my old ones. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where are you lunching, Harry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>'' At Aunt Agatha's. I have asked myself and Mr. Gray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) latest protege .'' <div class="bookquote">``Humph! tell your Aunt Agatha, Harry, not to bother me any more with her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) charity appeals.
<p/>I am sick of them. Why, the good woman thinks that I have nothing to do but to write cheques for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) silly fads.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle George/George</b></font>)</div>'' All right, Uncle George, I'll tell her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), but it won't have any effect. Philanthropic people lose all sense of humanity.
<p/>It is their distinguishing characteristic. '' The old gentleman growled approvingly and rang the bell for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) servant. Lord Henry passed up the low arcade into Burlington Street and turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) steps in the direction of Berkeley Square.
<p/>Crudely as it had been told to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), it had yet stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) by its suggestion of a strange, almost modern romance.
<p/>So that was the story of Dorian Gray's parentage. A beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion. A few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous, treacherous crime.
<p/>Months of voiceless agony, and then a child born in pain. The mother snatched away by death, the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man.
<p/>Yes; it was an interesting background. It posed the lad, made him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) more perfect, as it were. Behind every exquisite thing that existed, there was something tragic.
<p/>And how charming he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had been at dinner the night before, as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) at the club, the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face.
<p/>Worlds had to be in travail, that the meanest flower might blow.... Talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was like playing upon an exquisite violin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) answered to every touch and thrill of the bow.... There was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence. No other activity was like it.
<p/>To project one's soul into some gracious form, and let it tarry there for a moment; to hear one's own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth; to convey one's temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume: there was a real joy in that--perhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own, an age grossly carnal in its pleasures, and grossly common in its aims....
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was a marvellous type, too, this lad, whom by so curious a chance he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) had met in Basil's studio, or could be fashioned into a marvellous type, at any rate.
<p/>Grace was his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), and the white purity of boyhood, and beauty such as old Greek marbles kept for us. There was nothing that one could not do with him (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) could be made a Titan or a toy. What a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade! ...
<p/>The new manner in art, the fresh mode of looking at life, suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all; the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland, and walked unseen in open field, suddenly showing herself, Dryadlike and not afraid, because in his (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) soul who sought for her (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed; the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming, as it were, refined, and gaining a kind of symbolical value, as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real: how strange it all was!
<p/>And Basil? From a psychological point of view, how interesting he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was! He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) remembered something like it in history. Was it not Plato, that artist in thought, who had first analyzed it?
<p/>Was it not Buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnet-sequence? But in our own century it was strange....
<p/>Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Plato</b></font>) would try to be to Dorian Gray what, without knowing it, the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would seek to dominate him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>)--had already, indeed, half done so. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would make that wonderful spirit his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own. There was something fascinating in this son of love and death.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) stopped and glanced up at the houses. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had passed his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) aunt's some distance, and, smiling to himself, turned back.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) entered the somewhat sombre hall, the butler told him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) that they had gone in to lunch. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) gave one of the footmen his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) hat and stick and passed into the dining-room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) invented a facile excuse, and having taken the vacant seat next to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), looked round to see who was there.
<p/>'' Late as usual, Harry,'' cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) aunt, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) head at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). Dorian bowed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shyly from the end of the table, a flush of pleasure stealing into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>Opposite was the Duchess of Harley, a lady of admirable good-nature and good temper, much liked by every one who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>), and of those ample architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are described by contemporary historians as stoutness.
<p/>Next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) sat, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) right, Sir Thomas Burdon, a Radical member of Parliament, who followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Burdon</b></font>) leader in public life and in private life followed the best cooks, dining with the Tories and thinking with the Liberals, in accordance with a wise and well-known rule.
<p/>The post on her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) left was occupied by Mr. Erskine of Treadley, an old gentleman of considerable charm and culture, who had fallen, however, into bad habits of silence, having, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) explained once to Lady Agatha, said everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) had to say before he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) was thirty.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) own neighbour was Mrs. Vandeleur, one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) aunt's oldest friends, a perfect saint amongst women, but so dreadfully dowdy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vandeleur</b></font>) reminded one of a badly bound hymn-book.
<p/>Fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Vandeleur</b></font>) had on the other side Lord Faudel, a most intelligent middle-aged mediocrity, as bald as a ministerial statement in the House of Commons, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Vandeleur</b></font>) was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) remarked once himself, that all really good people fall into, and from which none of them ever quite escape.
<p/>'' We are talking about poor Dartmoor, Lord Henry,'' cried the duchess, nodding pleasantly to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) across the table. '' Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will really marry this fascinating young person?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) has made up her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) mind to propose to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), Duchess. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Agatha/Agatha</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Agatha. '' Really, some one should interfere.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I am told, on excellent authority, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) father keeps an American dry-goods store,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas Burdon, looking supercilious.
<p/>'' My uncle has already suggested pork-packing, Sir Thomas. '' <div class="bookquote">``Dry-goods! What are American dry-goods? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>asked the duchess, raising her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) large hands in wonder and accentuating the verb.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``American novels,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry, helping himself to some quail. The duchess looked puzzled. '' Don't mind him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), my dear,'' whispered Lady Agatha.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) never means anything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) says. '' '' When America was discovered,'' said the Radical member--and he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) began to give some wearisome facts.
<p/>Like all people who try to exhaust a subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) exhausted his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) listeners. The duchess sighed and exercised her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) privilege of interruption.
<p/>'' I wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Really, our girls have no chance nowadays.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, after all, America never has been discovered,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Erskine</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Erskine; <div class="bookquote">``I myself would say that it had merely been detected.
<p/>It is most unfair.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Erskine</b></font>)</div>'' '' Oh! but I have seen specimens of the inhabitants,'' answered the duchess vaguely. '' I must confess that most of them are extremely pretty.
<p/>And they dress well, too. They get all their dresses in Paris. I wish I could afford to do the same.''
<p/>They say that when good Americans die they go to Paris,'' chuckled Sir Thomas, who had a large wardrobe of Humour's cast-off clothes.
<p/>'' '' Really! And where do bad Americans go to when they die? '' inquired the duchess. '' They go to America,'' murmured Lord Henry.
<p/>Sir Thomas frowned. '' I am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) said to Lady Agatha.
<p/>'' I have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors, who, in such matters, are extremely civil. I assure you that it is an education to visit it.''
<p/>'' But must we really see Chicago in order to be educated?'' asked Mr. Erskine plaintively. '' I don't feel up to the journey.
<p/>'' Sir Thomas waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hand. '' Mr. Erskine of Treadley has the world on his (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) shelves. We practical men like to see things, not to read about them.
<p/>The Americans are an extremely interesting people. They are absolutely reasonable. I think that is their distinguishing characteristic. Yes, Mr. Erskine, an absolutely reasonable people.
<p/>I assure you there is no nonsense about the Americans.'' <div class="bookquote">``How dreadful!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry. '' I can stand brute force, but brute reason is quite unbearable.
<p/>There is something unfair about its use. It is hitting below the intellect. '' <div class="bookquote">``I do not understand you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, growing rather red.
<p/>'' I do, Lord Henry,'' murmured Mr. Erskine, with a smile. '' Paradoxes are all very well in their way...'' rejoined the baronet.
<p/>'' Was that a paradox?'' asked Mr. Erskine. '' I did not think so. Perhaps it was. Well, the way of paradoxes is the way of truth.
<p/>To test reality we must see it on the tight rope. When the verities become acrobats, we can judge them.'' ''
<p/>Dear me!'' said Lady Agatha, ``how you men argue! I am sure I never can make out what you are talking about.
<p/>Oh! Harry, I am quite vexed with you. Why do you try to persuade our nice Mr. Dorian Gray to give up the East End?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I want him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to play to me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, smiling, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked down the table and caught a bright answering glance.
<p/>I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would be quite invaluable. They would love his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) playing. '' '' But they are so unhappy in Whitechapel,'' continued Lady Agatha.
<p/>'' I can sympathize with everything except suffering,'' said Lord Henry, shrugging his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. '' I cannot sympathize with that. It is too ugly, too horrible, too distressing.
<p/>There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathize with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life.
<p/>The less said about life's sores, the better.'' <div class="bookquote">``Still, the East End is a very important problem,''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div>remarked Sir Thomas with a grave shake of the head.
<p/>'' Quite so,'' answered the young lord. '' It is the problem of slavery, and we try to solve it by amusing the slaves.
<p/>'' The politician looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) keenly. '' What change do you propose, then?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) asked. Lord Henry laughed. '' I don't desire to change anything in England except the weather,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered.
<p/>But, as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an over-expenditure of sympathy, I would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight.
<p/>The advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray, and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional.''
<p/>'' I am quite content with philosophic contemplation. '' But we have such grave responsibilities,'' ventured Mrs. Vandeleur timidly. '' Terribly grave,'' echoed Lady Agatha.
<p/>Lord Henry looked over at Mr. Erskine. '' Humanity takes itself too seriously. It is the world's original sin. If the caveman had known how to laugh, history would have been different.
<p/>I have always felt rather guilty when I came to see your dear aunt, for I take no interest at all in the East End.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You are really very comforting,''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>warbled the duchess. '' For the future I shall be able to look her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) in the face without a blush.''
<p/>'' A blush is very becoming, Duchess,'' remarked Lord Henry. '' Only when one is young,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) answered. '' When an old woman like myself blushes, it is a very bad sign.
<p/>Ah! Lord Henry, I wish you would tell me how to become young again. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought for a moment. ''
<p/>Can you remember any great error that you committed in your early days, Duchess? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) across the table.
<p/>'' A great many, I fear,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) cried. '' Then commit them over again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said gravely. '' To get back one's youth, one has merely to repeat one's follies.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``A delightful theory! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) exclaimed. '' I must put it into practice. '' <div class="bookquote">``A dangerous theory!''  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas/Thomas Burdon</b></font>)</div>came from Sir Thomas's tight lips.
<p/>Lady Agatha shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) head, but could not help being amused. Mr. Erskine listened. '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``that is one of the great secrets of life.
<p/>Nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense, and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are one's mistakes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) played with the idea and grew wilful; tossed it into the air and transformed it; let it escape and recaptured it; made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox.
<p/>The praise of folly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) went on, soared into a philosophy, and philosophy herself became young, and catching the mad music of pleasure, wearing, one might fancy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) wine-stained robe and wreath of ivy, danced like a Bacchante over the hills of life, and mocked the slow Silenus for being sober.
<p/>trod the huge press at which wise Omar sits, till the seething grape-juice rose round her (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles, or crawled in red foam over the vat's black, dripping, sloping sides.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>A laugh ran round the table. Facts fled before her (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) like frightened forest things. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) white feet It was an extraordinary improvisation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Omar</b></font>) felt that the eyes of Dorian Gray were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), and the consciousness that amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) audience there was one whose temperament he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wished to fascinate seemed to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wit keenness and to lend colour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>Dorian Gray never took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) gaze off him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), but sat like one under a spell, smiles chasing each other over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lips and wonder growing grave in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) darkening eyes.
<p/>At last, liveried in the costume of the age, reality entered the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) carriage was waiting.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was brilliant, fantastic, irresponsible. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) charmed his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) listeners out of themselves, and they followed his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) pipe, laughing. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) wrung her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) hands in mock despair.
<p/>I have to call for my husband at the club, to take him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to some absurd meeting at Willis's Rooms, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Willis</b></font>) is going to be in the chair.
<p/>'' How annoying! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) cried. '' I must go. If I am late he (<font color='blue'><b>Willis</b></font>) is sure to be furious, and I couldn't have a scene in this bonnet.
<p/>It is far too fragile. A harsh word would ruin it. No, I must go, dear Agatha. Good-bye, Lord Henry, you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing.
<p/>I am sure I don't know what to say about your views. You must come and dine with us some night.
<p/>Ah! that is very nice, and very wrong of you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) cried; <div class="bookquote">``so mind you come'' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) swept out of the room, followed by Lady Agatha and the other ladies.
<p/>When Lord Henry had sat down again, Mr. Erskine moved round, and taking a chair close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>), placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Erskine</b></font>) arm.
<p/>Tuesday? Are you disengaged Tuesday?'' <div class="bookquote">``For you I would throw over anybody, Duchess,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry with a bow. '' ''
<p/>You talk books away,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``why don't you write one?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am too fond of reading books to care to write them, Mr. Erskine.
<p/>I should like to write a novel certainly, a novel that would be as lovely as a Persian carpet and as unreal.
<p/>But there is no literary public in England for anything except newspapers, primers, and encyclopaedias. Of all people in the world the English have the least sense of the beauty of literature.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I fear you are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Erskine</b></font>)</div>answered Mr. Erskine. '' I myself used to have literary ambitions, but I gave them up long ago.
<p/>And now, my dear young friend, if you will allow me to call you so, may I ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch?''
<p/>In fact I consider you extremely dangerous, and if anything happens to our good duchess, we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I quite forget what I said,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>smiled Lord Henry. '' Was it all very bad?'' <div class="bookquote">``Very bad indeed. But I should like to talk to you about life.
<p/>Some day, when you are tired of London, come down to Treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable Burgundy

<p/>It has a perfect host, and a perfect library. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will complete it,''  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>answered the old gentleman with a courteous bow.
<p/>'' And now I must bid good-bye to your excellent aunt. I am due at the Athenaeum. It is the hour when we sleep there.''
<p/>'' All of you, Mr. Erskine?'' '' Forty of us, in forty arm-chairs. We are practising for an English Academy of Letters.
<p/>'' Lord Henry laughed and rose. '' I am going to the park,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cried. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was passing out of the door, Dorian Gray touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) on the arm.
<p/>'' Let me come with you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) murmured. '' But I thought you had promised Basil Hallward to go and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>),'' answered Lord Henry.
<p/>'' I would sooner come with you; yes, I feel I must come with you. Do let me. And you will promise to talk to me all the time?
<p/>No one talks so wonderfully as you do. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! I have talked quite enough for to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, smiling.
<p/>'' All I want now is to look at life. You may come and look at it with me, if you care to.
<p/>CHAPTER 4 One afternoon, a month later, Dorian Gray was reclining in a luxurious arm-chair, in the little library of Lord Henry's house in Mayfair.
<p/>It was, in its way, a very charming room, with its high panelled wainscoting of olive-stained oak, its cream-coloured frieze and ceiling of raised plasterwork, and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk, long-fringed Persian rugs.
<p/>On a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by Clodion, and beside it lay a copy of Les Cent Nouvelles, bound for Margaret of Valois by Clovis Eve and powdered with the gilt daisies that Queen had selected for her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) device.
<p/>Some large blue china jars and parrot-tulips were ranged on the mantelshelf, and through the small leaded panes of the window streamed the apricot-coloured light of a summer day in London.
<p/>'' Lord Henry had not yet come in. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was always late on principle, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) principle being that punctuality is the thief of time.
<p/>So the lad was looking rather sulky, as with listless fingers he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) turned over the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition of Manon Lescaut that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had found in one of the book-cases.
<p/>The formal monotonous ticking of the Louis Quatorze clock annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>). Once or twice he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) thought of going away. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) heard a step outside, and the door opened.
<p/>'' How late you are, Harry! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) murmured. '' I am afraid it is not Harry, Mr. Gray,'' answered a shrill voice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) glanced quickly round and rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) feet. '' I beg your pardon. I thought-- '' '' You thought it was my husband.
<p/>It is only his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife. You must let me introduce myself. I know you quite well by your photographs. I think my husband has got seventeen of them.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Not seventeen, Lady Henry?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well, eighteen, then. And I saw you with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) the other night at the opera. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was a curious woman, whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) laughed nervously as she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spoke, and watched him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) vague forget-me-not eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was usually in love with somebody, and, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) passion was never returned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had kept all her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) illusions.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) name was Victoria, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had a perfect mania for going to church.
<p/>'' That was at Lohengrin, Lady Henry, I think?'' '' Yes; it was at dear Lohengrin. I like Wagner's music better than anybody's.
<p/>It is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says. That is a great advantage, don't you think so, Mr. Gray?''
<p/>The same nervous staccato laugh broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thin lips, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fingers began to play with a long tortoise-shell paper-knife.
<p/>Dorian smiled and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head: <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I don't think so, Lady Henry. I never talk during music--at least, during good music.
<p/>If one hears bad music, it is one's duty to drown it in conversation.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>``Ah! that is one of Harry's views, isn't it, Mr. Gray?
<p/>I always hear Harry's views from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) friends. It is the only way I get to know of them. But you must not think I don't like good music.
<p/>I adore it, but I am afraid of it. It makes me too romantic. I have simply worshipped pianists--two at a time, sometimes, Harry tells me.
<p/>I don't know what it is about them. Perhaps it is that they are foreigners. They all are, ain't they? Even those that are born in England become foreigners after a time, don't they?
<p/>It is so clever of them, and such a compliment to art. Makes it quite cosmopolitan, doesn't it? You have never been to any of my parties, have you, Mr. Gray?
<p/>You must come. I can't afford orchids, but I spare no expense in foreigners. They make one's rooms look so picturesque.
<p/>But here is Harry! Harry, I came in to look for you, to ask you something --I forget what it was--and I found Mr. Gray here.
<p/>We have had such a pleasant chat about music. We have quite the same ideas. No; I think our ideas are quite different.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am charmed, my love, quite charmed,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, elevating his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) dark, crescent-shaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused smile.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has been most pleasant. I am so glad I've seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). '' '' So sorry I am late, Dorian.
<p/>I went to look after a piece of old brocade in Wardour Street and had to bargain for hours for it.
<p/>Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing. '' <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I must be going,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Henry</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lady Henry, breaking an awkward silence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) silly sudden laugh.
<p/>'' I have promised to drive with the duchess. Good-bye, Mr. Gray. Good-bye, Harry. You are dining out, I suppose? So am
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I dare say, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, shutting the door behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as, looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the rain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) flitted out of the room, leaving a faint odour of frangipanni.
<p/>I. Perhaps I shall see you at Lady Thornbury's. '' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the sofa.
<p/>'' Never marry a woman with straw-coloured hair, Dorian,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said after a few puffs. '' Why, Harry? '' <div class="bookquote">``Because they are so sentimental.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But I like sentimental people.'' <div class="bookquote">``Never marry at all, Dorian. Men marry because they are tired; women, because they are curious: both are disappointed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I am likely to marry, Harry. I am too much in love. That is one of your aphorisms.
<p/>I am putting it into practice, as I do everything that you say. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Who are you in love with?'' asked Lord Henry after a pause.
<p/>'' With an actress,'' said Dorian Gray, blushing. Lord Henry shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. '' That is a rather commonplace debut .''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You would not say so if you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>), Harry.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Who is she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>)?'' '' Her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) name is Sibyl Vane.'' <div class="bookquote">``Never heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No one has. People will some day, however. She (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) is a genius.'' '' My dear boy, no woman is a genius.
<p/>Women are a decorative sex. They never have anything to say, but they say it charmingly. Women represent the triumph of matter over mind, just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals.''
<p/>'' Harry, how can you?'' '' My dear Dorian, it is quite true. I am analysing women at present, so I ought to know.
<p/>The subject is not so abstruse as I thought it was. I find that, ultimately, there are only two kinds of women, the plain and the coloured.
<p/>The plain women are very useful. If you want to gain a reputation for respectability, you have merely to take them down to supper.
<p/>The other women are very charming. They commit one mistake, however. They paint in order to try and look young. Our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly.
<p/>Rouge and esprit used to go together. That is all over now. As long as a woman can look ten years younger than her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is perfectly satisfied.
<p/>As for conversation, there are only five women in London worth talking to, and two of these can't be admitted into decent society.
<p/>However, tell me about your genius. How long have you known her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! Harry, your views terrify me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind that.
<p/>How long have you known her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``About three weeks. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And where did you come across her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you, Harry, but you mustn't be unsympathetic about it.
<p/>After all, it never would have happened if I had not met you. You filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life.
<p/>As I lounged in the park, or strolled down Piccadilly, I used to look at every one who passed me and wonder, with a mad curiosity, what sort of lives they led.
<p/>For days after I met you, something seemed to throb in my veins. Some of them fascinated me. Others filled me with terror.
<p/>There was an exquisite poison in the air. I had a passion for sensations.... Well, one evening about seven o'clock, I determined to go out in search of some adventure.
<p/>I felt that this grey monstrous London of ours, with its myriads of people, its sordid sinners, and its splendid sins, as you once phrased it, must have something in store for me.
<p/>I remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together, about the search for beauty being the real secret of life.
<p/>I don't know what I expected, but I went out and wandered eastward, soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares.
<p/>I fancied a thousand things. The mere danger gave me a sense of delight. About half-past eight I passed by an absurd little theatre, with great flaring gas-jets and gaudy play-bills.
<p/>A hideous Jew, in the most amazing waistcoat I ever beheld in my life, was standing at the entrance, smoking a vile cigar.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) had greasy ringlets, and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt. ' Have a box, my Lord?'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) said, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) saw me, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) took off his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) hat with an air of gorgeous servility. There was something about him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), Harry, that amused me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was such a monster. You will laugh at me, I know, but I really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stage-box.
<p/>To the present day I can't make out why I did so; and yet if I hadn't--my dear Harry, if I hadn't
<p/>--I should have missed the greatest romance of my life. I see you are laughing. It is horrid of you!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not laughing, Dorian; at least I am not laughing at you.
<p/>But you should not say the greatest romance of your life. You should say the first romance of your life. You will always be loved, and you will always be in love with love.
<p/>A grande passion is the privilege of people who have nothing to do. That is the one use of the idle classes of a country.
<p/>Don't be afraid. There are exquisite things in store for you. This is merely the beginning.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you think my nature so shallow?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray angrily.
<p/>'' No; I think your nature so deep. '' <div class="bookquote">``How do you mean?''  (<font color='red'><b>boy people</b></font>)</div>'' My dear boy, the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people.
<p/>What they call their loyalty, and their fidelity, I call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination. Faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellect--simply a confession of failure.
<p/>Faithfulness! I must analyse it some day. The passion for property is in it. There are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up.
<p/>But I don't want to interrupt you. Go on with your story. '' '' Well, I found myself seated in a horrid little private box, with a vulgar drop-scene staring me in the face.
<p/>I looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house. It was a tawdry affair, all Cupids and cornucopias, like a third-rate wedding-cake.
<p/>The gallery and pit were fairly full, but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty, and there was hardly a person in what I suppose they called the dress-circle.
<p/>Women went about with oranges and ginger-beer, and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on.'' <div class="bookquote">``It must have been just like the palmy days of the British drama.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Just like, I should fancy, and very depressing. I began to wonder what on earth I should do when I caught sight of the play-bill.
<p/>What do you think the play was, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should think `The Idiot Boy', or `Dumb but Innocent'. Our fathers used to like that sort of piece, I believe.
<p/>The longer I live, Dorian, the more keenly I feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us.
<p/>In art, as in politics, les grandperes ont toujours tort . ''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>'' This play was good enough for us, Harry.
<p/>I must admit that I was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing Shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place.
<p/>It was Romeo and Juliet. Still, I felt interested, in a sort of way. At any rate, I determined to wait for the first act.
<p/>There was a dreadful orchestra, presided over by a young Hebrew who sat at a cracked piano, that nearly drove me away, but at last the drop-scene was drawn up and the play began.
<p/>Romeo was a stout elderly gentleman, with corked eyebrows, a husky tragedy voice, and a figure like a beer-barrel. Mercutio was almost as bad.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) was played by the low-comedian, who had introduced gags of his (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) own and was on most friendly terms with the pit.
<p/>They were both as grotesque as the scenery, and that looked as if it had come out of a country-booth. But Juliet!
<p/>Harry, imagine a girl, hardly seventeen years of age, with a little, flowerlike face, a small Greek head with plaited coils of dark-brown hair, eyes that were violet wells of passion, lips that were like the petals of a rose.
<p/>You said to me once that pathos left you unmoved, but that beauty, mere beauty, could fill your eyes with tears.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was the loveliest thing I had ever seen in my life. I tell you, Harry, I could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me.
<p/>And her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice--I never heard such a voice. It was very low at first, with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon one's ear.
<p/>Then it became a little louder, and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy. In the garden-scene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing.
<p/>There were moments, later on, when it had the wild passion of violins. You know how a voice can stir one.
<p/>Your voice and the voice of Sibyl Vane are two things that I shall never forget. When I close my eyes, I hear them, and each of them says something different.
<p/>I don't know which to follow. Why should I not love her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>)? Harry, I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) is everything to me in life.
<p/>Night after night I go to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) play. One evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) is Rosalind, and the next evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) is Imogen.
<p/>I have watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) wandering through the forest of Arden, disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) has been mad, and has come into the presence of a guilty king, and given him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of.
<p/>I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) die in the gloom of an Italian tomb, sucking the poison from her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) lover's lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) has been innocent, and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) reedlike throat.
<p/>I have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) in every age and in every costume. Ordinary women never appeal to one's imagination. They are limited to their century.
<p/>No glamour ever transfigures them. One knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets. One can always find them.
<p/>There is no mystery in any of them. They ride in the park in the morning and chatter at tea-parties in the afternoon.
<p/>They have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner. They are quite obvious. But an actress! How different an actress is!
<p/>Harry! why didn't you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress? '' '' Because I have loved so many of them, Dorian.''
<p/>'' Oh, yes, horrid people with dyed hair and painted faces. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't run down dyed hair and painted faces. There is an extraordinary charm in them, sometimes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry.
<p/>'' I wish now I had not told you about Sibyl Vane.'' <div class="bookquote">``You could not have helped telling me, Dorian. All through your life you will tell me everything you do.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Harry, I believe that is true. I cannot help telling you things. You have a curious influence over me. If I ever did a crime, I would come and confess it to you.
<p/>You would understand me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``People like you--the wilful sunbeams of life--don't commit crimes, Dorian. But I am much obliged for the compliment, all the same.
<p/>And now tell me--reach me the matches, like a good boy-- thanks--what are your actual relations with Sibyl Vane? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>Dorian Gray leaped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) feet, with flushed cheeks and burning eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is only the sacred things that are worth touching, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, with a strange touch of pathos in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' Harry! Sibyl Vane is sacred!'' '' But why should you be annoyed? I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) will belong to you some day.
<p/>When one is in love, one always begins by deceiving one's self, and one always ends by deceiving others. That is what the world calls a romance.
<p/>On the first night I was at the theatre, the horrid old Jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).
<p/>I was furious with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) that Juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) body was lying in a marble tomb in Verona.
<p/>I think, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) blank look of amazement, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was under the impression that I had taken too much champagne, or something.''
<p/>You know her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>), at any rate, I suppose?'' ``Of course I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``I am not surprised.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) asked me if I wrote for any of the newspapers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) seemed terribly disappointed at that, and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>), and that they were every one of them to be bought.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) I never even read them. <div class="bookquote">``I should not wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) was quite right there.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) seemed to think they were beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) means,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>laughed Dorian. '' By this time, however, the lights were being put out in the theatre, and I had to go.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) wanted me to try some cigars that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) strongly recommended. I declined. The next night, of course, I arrived at the place again.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) saw me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) made me a low bow and assured me that I was a munificent patron of art.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) told me once, with an air of pride, that his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) five bankruptcies were entirely due to `The Bard,' as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bard</b></font>) insisted on calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Bard</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bard</b></font>) was a most offensive brute, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bard</b></font>) had an extraordinary passion for Shakespeare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) seemed to think it a distinction.''
<p/>'' It was a distinction, my dear Dorian--a great distinction. Most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life.
<p/>To have ruined one's self over poetry is an honour. But when did you first speak to Miss Sibyl Vane?'' ''
<p/>The third night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had been playing Rosalind. I could not help going round. I had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) some flowers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had looked at me--at least I fancied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had.
<p/>The old Jew was persistent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) seemed determined to take me behind, so I consented. It was curious my not wanting to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), wasn't it?''
<p/>'' No; I don't think so.'' '' My dear Harry, why?'' <div class="bookquote">``I will tell you some other time. Now I want to know about the girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) what I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) performance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed quite unconscious of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) power.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sibyl? Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was so shy and so gentle. There is something of a child about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). I think we were both rather nervous.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) would insist on calling me `My Lord,' so I had to assure Sibyl that I was not anything of the kind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) said quite simply to me, `You look more like a prince. I must call you Prince Charming.'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Upon my word, Dorian, Miss Sibyl knows how to pay compliments.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) mother, a faded tired woman who played Lady Capulet in a sort of magenta dressing-wrapper on the first night, and looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) had seen better days.

<p/>I want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad. I want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness, to wake their ashes into pain.
<p/>My God, Harry, how I worship her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was walking up and down the room as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) spoke. Hectic spots of red burned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) was terribly excited. Lord Henry watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with a subtle sense of pleasure. How different he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was now from the shy frightened boy he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had met in Basil Hallward's studio!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nature had developed like a flower, had borne blossoms of scarlet flame. Out of its secret hiding-place had crept his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) soul, and desire had come to meet it on the way.
<p/>'' And what do you propose to do?'' said Lord Henry at last. '' I want you and Basil to come with me some night and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) act.
<p/>I have not the slightest fear of the result. You are certain to acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) genius. Then we must get her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out of the Jew's hands.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is bound to him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) for three years--at least for two years and eight months--from the present time. I shall have to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) something, of course.
<p/>When all that is settled, I shall take a West End theatre and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) out properly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will make the world as mad as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has made me.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has not merely art, consummate art-instinct, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) has personality also; and you have often told me that it is personalities, not principles, that move the age.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That would be impossible, my dear boy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) will.

<p/>It is rather horrid of me, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame, specially designed by himself, and, though I am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than I am, I must admit that I delight in it.
<p/>I have not laid eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) for a week. Perhaps you had better write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). I don't want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) says things that annoy me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) gives me good advice. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>Lord Henry smiled. '' People are very fond of giving away what they need most themselves.
<p/>It is what I call the depth of generosity.'' '' Oh, Basil is the best of fellows, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) seems to me to be just a bit of a Philistine.
<p/>Since I have known you, Harry, I have discovered that.'' '' Basil, my dear boy, puts everything that is charming in him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) into his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) work.
<p/>The consequence is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) has nothing left for life but his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) prejudices, his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) principles, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) common sense. The only artists I have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists.
<p/>Good artists exist simply in what they make, and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are. A great poet, a really great poet, is the most unpoetical of all creatures.
<p/>But inferior poets are absolutely fascinating. The worse their rhymes are, the more picturesque they look. The mere fact of having published a book of second-rate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wonder is that really so, Harry?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian Gray, putting some perfume on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) handkerchief out of a large, gold-topped bottle that stood on the table.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lives the poetry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cannot write. The others write the poetry that they dare not realize. '' '' It must be, if you say it.
<p/>And now I am off. Imogen is waiting for me. Don't forget about to-morrow. Good-bye. '' As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) left the room, Lord Henry's heavy eyelids drooped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) began to think.
<p/>Certainly few people had ever interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) so much as Dorian Gray, and yet the lad's mad adoration of some one else caused him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science, but the ordinary subject-matter of that science had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) trivial and of no import.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was pleased by it. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) a more interesting study. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had begun by vivisecting himself, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had ended by vivisecting others.
<p/>It was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure, one could not wear over one's face a mask of glass, nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams.
<p/>Human life--that appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) the one thing worth investigating. Compared to it there was nothing else of any value. There were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them.
<p/>There were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature. And, yet, what a great reward one received!
<p/>To note the curious hard logic of passion, and the emotional coloured life of the intellect--to observe where they met, and where they separated, at what point they were in unison, and at what point they were at discord
<p/>How wonderful the whole world became to one! --there was a delight in that! What matter what the cost was? One could never pay too high a price for any sensation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was conscious--and the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) brown agate eyes--that it was through certain words of his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>), musical words said with musical utterance, that Dorian Gray's soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets, but to the few, to the elect, the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away.
<p/>Sometimes this was the effect of art, and chiefly of the art of literature, which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect.
<p/>But now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art, was indeed, in its way, a real work of art, life having its elaborate masterpieces, just as poetry has, or sculpture, or painting.
<p/>To a large extent the lad was his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own creation. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) premature. That was something. Yes, the lad was premature.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was gathering his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) harvest while it was yet spring. The pulse and passion of youth were in him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was becoming self-conscious.
<p/>It was delightful to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). With his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) beautiful face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) beautiful soul, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was a thing to wonder at.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play, whose joys seem to be remote from one, but whose sorrows stir one's sense of beauty, and whose wounds are like red roses.
<p/>It was no matter how it all ended, or was destined to end. Soul and body, body and soul--how mysterious they were!
<p/>There was animalism in the soul, and the body had its moments of spirituality. The senses could refine, and the intellect could degrade.
<p/>Who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased, or the psychical impulse began? How shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists!
<p/>And yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools! Was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin?
<p/>Or was the body really in the soul, as Giordano Bruno thought? The separation of spirit from matter was a mystery, and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bruno</b></font>) began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us.
<p/>As it was, we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others. Experience was of no ethical value. It was merely the name men gave to their mistakes.
<p/>Moralists had, as a rule, regarded it as a mode of warning, had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character, had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid.
<p/>All that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past, and that the sin we had done once, and with loathing, we would do many times, and with joy.
<p/>It was clear to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) that the experimental method was the only method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions; and certainly Dorian Gray was a subject made to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand, and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results.
<p/>But there was no motive power in experience. It was as little of an active cause as conscience itself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) sudden mad love for Sibyl Vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest.
<p/>There was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it, curiosity and the desire for new experiences, yet it was not a simple, but rather a very complex passion.
<p/>What there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination, changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from sense, and was for that very reason all the more dangerous.
<p/>It was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us. Our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious.
<p/>While Lord Henry sat dreaming on these things, a knock came to the door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) valet entered and reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) it was time to dress for dinner.
<p/>It often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) got up and looked out into the street.
<p/>The sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite. The panes glowed like plates of heated metal.
<p/>The sky above was like a faded rose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) friend's young fiery-coloured life and wondered how it was all going to end.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) arrived home, about half-past twelve o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw a telegram lying on the hall table. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opened it and found it was from Dorian Gray.
<p/>It was to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was engaged to be married to Sibyl Vane. CHAPTER 5 <div class="bookquote">``Mother, Mother, I am so happy!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>whispered the girl, burying her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face in the lap of the faded, tired-looking woman who, with back turned to the shrill intrusive light, was sitting in the one arm-chair that their dingy sitting-room contained.
<p/>'' I am so happy! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``and you must be happy, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Vane winced and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) thin, bismuth-whitened hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) daughter's head.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Happy! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) echoed, <div class="bookquote">``I am only happy, Sibyl, when I see you act. You must not think of anything but your acting.
<p/>Mr. Isaacs has been very good to us, and we owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) money. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The girl looked up and pouted. ''
<p/>Money, Mother? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``what does money matter? Love is more than money.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Isaacs has advanced us fifty pounds to pay off our debts and to get a proper outfit for James.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is not a gentleman, Mother, and I hate the way he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) talks to me,'' said the girl, rising to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feet and going over to the window.
<p/>You must not forget that, Sibyl. Fifty pounds is a very large sum. Mr. Isaacs has been most considerate.'' '' ''
<p/>I don't know how we could manage without him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>),'' answered the elder woman querulously. Sibyl Vane tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) head and laughed.
<p/>'' We don't want him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) any more, Mother. Prince Charming rules life for us now. '' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) paused. A rose shook in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) blood and shadowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>Quick breath parted the petals of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) lips. They trembled. Some southern wind of passion swept over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) and stirred the dainty folds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) dress.
<p/>'' I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said simply. '' Foolish child! foolish child!'' was the parrot-phrase flung in answer. The waving of crooked, false-jewelled fingers gave grotesqueness to the words.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance, then closed for a moment, as though to hide their secret.
<p/>The girl laughed again. The joy of a caged bird was in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice. When they opened, the mist of a dream had passed across them.
<p/>Thin-lipped wisdom spoke at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from the worn chair, hinted at prudence, quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not listen. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was free in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prison of passion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prince, Prince Charming, was with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had called on memory to remake him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soul to search for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>), and it had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) back. His (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) kiss burned again upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyelids were warm with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) breath. Then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery. This young man might be rich.
<p/>If so, marriage should be thought of. Against the shell of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ear broke the waves of worldly cunning. The arrows of craft shot by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) saw the thin lips moving, and smiled. Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt the need to speak. The wordy silence troubled her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). ''
<p/>Mother, Mother,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``why does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love me so much?

<p/>But what does he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) see in me? I am not worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). And yet--why, I cannot tell--though I feel so much beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I don't feel humble.
<p/>The elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cheeks, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain.
<p/>I feel proud, terribly proud. Mother, did you love my father as I love Prince Charming?

<p/>'' Forgive me, Mother. I know it pains you to talk about our father. But it only pains you because you loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so much.
<p/>Don't look so sad. I am as happy to-day as you were twenty years ago. Ah! let me be happy for ever!''
<p/>'' My child, you are far too young to think of falling in love. Besides, what do you know of this young man?
<p/>The whole thing is most inconvenient, and really, when James is going away to Australia, and I have so much to think of, I must say that you should have shown more consideration.
<p/>You don't even know his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) name. However, as I said before, if he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is rich ...'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! Mother, Mother, let me be happy!
<p/>Mrs. Vane glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>), and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stage-player, clasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) arms.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>At this moment, the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was thick-set of figure, and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was not so finely bred as his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) sister. One would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them.
<p/>Mrs. Vane fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) and intensified her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) smile. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) mentally elevated her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) son to the dignity of an audience.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) felt sure that the tableau was interesting. '' You might keep some of your kisses for me, Sibyl, I think,'' said the lad with a good-natured grumble.
<p/>'' Ah! but you don't like being kissed, Jim,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) cried. '' You are a dreadful old bear. '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) ran across the room and hugged him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).
<p/>James Vane looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) sister's face with tenderness. '' I want you to come out with me for a walk, Sibyl.
<p/>My son, don't say such dreadful things,'' murmured Mrs. Vane, taking up a tawdry theatrical dress, with a sigh, and beginning to patch it.
<p/>I don't suppose I shall ever see this horrid London again. I am sure I don't want to. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) felt a little disappointed that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had not joined the group.
<p/>It would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation. '' Why not, Mother? I mean it. '' <div class="bookquote">``You pain me, my son.
<p/>I believe there is no society of any kind in the Colonies--nothing that I would call society--so when you have made your fortune, you must come back and assert yourself in London.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I trust you will return from Australia in a position of affluence. <div class="bookquote">``Society!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>muttered the lad. '' I don't want to know anything about that.
<p/>I should like to make some money to take you and Sibyl off the stage. I hate it.'' '' Oh, Jim!'' said Sibyl, laughing, <div class="bookquote">``how unkind of you!
<p/>I was afraid you were going to say good-bye to some of your friends--to Tom Hardy, who gave you that hideous pipe, or Ned Langton, who makes fun of you for smoking it.
<p/>But are you really going for a walk with me? That will be nice! It is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon.
<p/>Where shall we go? Let us go to the park.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl Vane/Sibyl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am too shabby,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Ned</b></font>) answered, frowning. '' Only swell people go to the park.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense, Jim,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) whispered, stroking the sleeve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) coat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) hesitated for a moment. '' Very well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``but don't be too long dressing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) danced out of the door. One could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) singing as she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) ran upstairs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) little feet pattered overhead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) walked up and down the room two or three times. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) turned to the still figure in the chair.
<p/>'' Mother, are my things ready? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) asked. '' Quite ready, James,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) answered, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) work.
<p/>For some months past she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had felt ill at ease when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was alone with this rough stern son of hers.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) used to wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) suspected anything. The silence, for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) made no other observation, became intolerable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) began to complain. Women defend themselves by attacking, just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders. '' I hope you will be contented, James, with your sea-faring life,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' You must remember that it is your own choice. You might have entered a solicitor's office. Solicitors are a very respectable class, and in the country often dine with the best families.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I hate offices, and I hate clerks,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) replied. '' But you are quite right. I have chosen my own life.
<p/>All I say is, watch over Sibyl. Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) come to any harm. Mother, you must watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``James, you really talk very strangely.
<p/>Of course I watch over Sibyl. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hear a gentleman comes every night to the theatre and goes behind to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).
<p/>Is that right? What about that?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are speaking about things you don't understand, James. In the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention.
<p/>I myself used to receive many bouquets at one time. That was when acting was really understood. As for Sibyl, I do not know at present whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) attachment is serious or not.
<p/>But there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is always most polite to me.
<p/>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has the appearance of being rich, and the flowers he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sends are lovely. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't know his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name, though,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>said the lad harshly.
<p/>'' No,'' answered his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mother with a placid expression in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) face. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has not yet revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) real name.
<p/>I think it is quite romantic of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is probably a member of the aristocracy. '' James Vane bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) lip.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Watch over Sibyl, Mother,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``watch over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' My son, you distress me very much. Sibyl is always under my special care.
<p/>Of course, if this gentleman is wealthy, there is no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) should not contract an alliance with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). I trust he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is one of the aristocracy.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has all the appearance of it, I must say. It might be a most brilliant marriage for Sibyl. They would make a charming couple.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) good looks are really quite remarkable; everybody notices them. '' The lad muttered something to himself and drummed on the window-pane with his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) coarse fingers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had just turned round to say something when the door opened and Sibyl ran in. '' How serious you both are!''
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) cried. '' What is the matter?'' <div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) answered. '' I suppose one must be serious sometimes. Good-bye, Mother; I will have my dinner at five o'clock.
<p/>Everything is packed, except my shirts, so you need not trouble.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, my son,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) answered with a bow of strained stateliness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) was extremely annoyed at the tone he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had adopted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>), and there was something in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) look that had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) feel afraid.
<p/>'' Kiss me, Mother,'' said the girl. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) flowerlike lips touched the withered cheek and warmed its frost. '' My child!
<p/>my child!'' cried Mrs. Vane, looking up to the ceiling in search of an imaginary gallery. <div class="bookquote">``Come, Sibyl,''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) brother impatiently.
<p/>The passersby glanced in wonder at the sullen heavy youth who, in coarse, ill-fitting clothes, was in the company of such a graceful, refined-looking girl.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hated his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mother's affectations. They went out into the flickering, wind-blown sunlight and strolled down the dreary Euston Road. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was like a common gardener walking with a rose.
<p/>Jim frowned from time to time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had that dislike of being stared at, which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was thinking of Prince Charming, and, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) all the more, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did not talk of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>), but prattled on about the ship in which Jim was going to sail, about the gold he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was certain to find, about the wonderful heiress whose life he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was to save from the wicked, red-shirted bushrangers.
<p/>Sibyl, however, was quite unconscious of the effect she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was producing. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) love was trembling in laughter on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) lips. For he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was not to remain a sailor, or a supercargo, or whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was going to be.
<p/>Fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship, with the hoarse, hump-backed waves trying to get in, and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was to leave the vessel at Melbourne, bid a polite good-bye to the captain, and go off at once to the gold-fields.
<p/>Oh, no! A sailor's existence was dreadful. Before a week was over he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was to come across a large nugget of pure gold,
<p/>the largest nugget that had ever been discovered, and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen.
<p/>The bushrangers were to attack them three times, and be defeated with immense slaughter. Or, no. He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was not to go to the gold-fields at all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was to be a nice sheep-farmer, and one evening, as he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was riding home, he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse, and give chase, and rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>).
<p/>Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) would fall in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>), and they would get married, and come home, and live in an immense house in London.
<p/>They were horrid places, where men got intoxicated, and shot each other in bar-rooms, and used bad language. Yes, there were delightful things in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>).
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) must be very good, and not lose his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) temper, or spend his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) money foolishly. She (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) was only a year older than he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was, but she (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) knew so much more of life.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) must be sure, also, to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) by every mail, and to say his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) prayers each night before he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) went to sleep.
<p/>God was very good, and would watch over him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) would pray for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), too, and in a few years he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would come back quite rich and happy.
<p/>The lad listened sulkily to her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) and made no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was heart-sick at leaving home. Yet it was not this alone that made him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) gloomy and morose.
<p/>Inexperienced though he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had still a strong sense of the danger of Sibyl's position. This young dandy who was making love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) could mean her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) no good.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was a gentleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) for that, hated him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) through some curious race-instinct for which he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could not account, and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother's nature, and in that saw infinite peril for Sibyl and Sibyl's happiness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had something on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mind to ask of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), something that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had brooded on for many months of silence.
<p/>A chance phrase that he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had heard at the theatre, a whispered sneer that had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) ears one night as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) waited at the stage-door, had set loose a train of horrible thoughts.
<p/>Children begin by loving their parents; as they grow older they judge them; sometimes they forgive them. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) mother! He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) remembered it as if it had been the lash of a hunting-crop across his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face.
<p/>You are not listening to a word I am saying, Jim,'' cried Sibyl, <div class="bookquote">``and I am making the most delightful plans for your future.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) brows knit together into a wedge-like furrow, and with a twitch of pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) underlip. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)</div>Do say something.
<p/>'' '' What do you want me to say?'' '' Oh! that you will be a good boy and not forget us,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) answered, smiling at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) shoulders. '' You are more likely to forget me than I am to forget you, Sibyl. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) flushed.
<p/>'' What do you mean, Jim? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) asked. '' You have a new friend, I hear. Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? Why have you not told me about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) means you no good.'' <div class="bookquote">``Stop, Jim! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) exclaimed. '' You must not say anything against him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you don't even know his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) name,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>answered the lad. '' Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)? I have a right to know. ''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) is called Prince Charming. Don't you like the name. Oh! you silly boy! you should never forget it. If you only saw him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), you would think him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the most wonderful person in the world.
<p/>Some day you will meet him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)--when you come back from Australia. You will like him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) so much. Everybody likes him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and I ... love him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>I wish you could come to the theatre to-night. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) is going to be there, and I am to play Juliet.
<p/>Oh! how I shall play it! Fancy, Jim, to be in love and play Juliet! To have him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) sitting there! To play for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) delight!
<p/>I am afraid I may frighten the company, frighten or enthrall them. To be in love is to surpass one's self.
<p/>Poor dreadful Mr. Isaacs will be shouting `genius' to his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) loafers at the bar. He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) has preached me as a dogma; to-night he (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) will announce me as a revelation.
<p/>I feel it. And it is all his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) only, Prince Charming, my wonderful lover, my god of graces. But I am poor beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>).
<p/>Poor? What does that matter? When poverty creeps in at the door, love flies in through the window. Our proverbs want rewriting.
<p/>They were made in winter, and it is summer now; spring-time for me, I think, a very dance of blossoms in blue skies.''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Isaacs</b></font>) is a gentleman,'' said the lad sullenly. '' A prince! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) cried musically. '' What more do you want?''
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) wants to enslave you.'' <div class="bookquote">``I shudder at the thought of being free.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I want you to beware of him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' To see him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) is to worship him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>); to know him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) is to trust him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).'' '' Sibyl, you are mad about him (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>).
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) laughed and took his (<font color='blue'><b>prince</b></font>) arm. '' You dear old Jim, you talk as if you were a hundred. Some day you will be in love yourself.
<p/>Surely you should be glad to think that, though you are going away, you leave me happier than I have ever been before.
<p/>Then you will know what it is. Don't look so sulky. Life has been hard for us both, terribly hard and difficult.
<p/>But it will be different now. You are going to a new world, and I have found one. Here are two chairs; let us sit down and see the smart people go by.
<p/>'' They took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers. The tulip-beds across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire.
<p/>A white dust--tremulous cloud of orris-root it seemed--hung in the panting air. The brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brother talk of himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hopes, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) prospects. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) spoke slowly and with effort. They passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters.
<p/>Sibyl felt oppressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) could not communicate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) joy. A faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) could win.
<p/>Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips, and in an open carriage with two ladies Dorian Gray drove past.
<p/>After some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) became silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) started to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) feet. '' There he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) cried. '' Who?'' said Jim Vane.
<p/>'' Prince Charming,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) answered, looking after the victoria. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) jumped up and seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) roughly by the arm. <div class="bookquote">``Show him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) to me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) exclaimed; but at that moment the Duke of Berwick's four-in-hand came between, and when it had left the space clear, the carriage had swept out of the park.
<p/>Which is he (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>)? Point him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) out. I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>)! '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>) is gone,'' murmured Sibyl sadly. '' I wish you had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>).''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish I had, for as sure as there is a God in heaven, if he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ever does you any wrong, I shall kill him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) in horror. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) words. They cut the air like a dagger. The people round began to gape.
<p/>A lady standing close to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tittered. <div class="bookquote">``Come away, Jim; come away,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) whispered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) doggedly as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed through the crowd.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) felt glad at what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had said. When they reached the Achilles Statue, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) turned round. There was pity in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes that became laughter on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lips.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head at him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>). '' You are foolish, Jim, utterly foolish; a bad-tempered boy, that is all. How can you say such horrible things?
<p/>You don't know what you are talking about. You are simply jealous and unkind. Ah! I wish you would fall in love.
<p/>Love makes people good, and what you said was wicked. '' <div class="bookquote">``I am sixteen,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``and I know what I am about.
<p/>Mother is no help to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) doesn't understand how to look after you. I wish now that I was not going to Australia at all.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not as long as you love him (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>), I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was the sullen answer.

<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``For ever, too!''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) had better.

Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) laughed and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) arm.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) was merely a boy. At the Marble Arch they hailed an omnibus, which left them close to their shabby home in the Euston Road.
<p/>It was after five o'clock, and Sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting. Jim insisted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) should do so.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) would sooner part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) when their mother was not present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) would be sure to make a scene, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Jim</b></font>) detested scenes of every kind.
<p/>There was jealousy in the lad's heart, and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), had come between them.
<p/>Yet, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) arms were flung round his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) neck, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) fingers strayed through his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hair, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) softened and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) with real affection.
<p/>In Sybil's own room they parted. There were tears in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) went downstairs. His (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mother was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) below.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) grumbled at his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) unpunctuality, as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) made no answer, but sat down to his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) meagre meal. The flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the stained cloth.
<p/>Through the rumble of omnibuses, and the clatter of street-cabs, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that was left to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>After some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) thrust away his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) plate and put his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) hands. He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had a right to know.
<p/>It should have been told to him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) before, if it was as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) suspected. Leaden with fear, his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mother watched him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>Words dropped mechanically from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lips. A tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) fingers. When the clock struck six, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) got up and went to the door.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) turned back and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Their eyes met. In hers he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) saw a wild appeal for mercy. It enraged him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>).
<p/>'' Mother, I have something to ask you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) eyes wandered vaguely about the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) made no answer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me the truth. I have a right to know. Were you married to my father?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) heaved a deep sigh.
<p/>The terrible moment, the moment that night and day, for weeks and months, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) had dreaded, had come at last, and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) felt no terror.
<p/>It was a sigh of relief. Indeed, in some measure it was a disappointment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>). The vulgar directness of the question called for a direct answer.
<p/>The situation had not been gradually led up to. It was crude. It reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) of a bad rehearsal. '' No,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) answered, wondering at the harsh simplicity of life.
<p/>'' My father was a scoundrel then! '' cried the lad, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) fists. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) head. '' I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was not free.
<p/>We loved each other very much. If he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had lived, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would have made provision for us. Don't speak against him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), my son.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was your father, and a gentleman. Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was highly connected. '' An oath broke from his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) lips. '' I don't care for myself,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``but don't let Sibyl....
<p/>It is a gentleman, isn't it, who is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), or says he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is? Highly connected, too, I suppose.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For a moment a hideous sense of humiliation came over the woman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head drooped. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes with shaking hands.
<p/>'' Sibyl has a mother,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) murmured; <div class="bookquote">``I had none. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The lad was touched. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) went towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), and stooping down, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).
<p/>I am sorry if I have pained you by asking about my father,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but I could not help it.
<p/>Don't forget that you will have only one child now to look after, and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister, I will find out who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, track him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down, and kill him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) like a dog.
<p/>The exaggerated folly of the threat, the passionate gesture that accompanied it, the mad melodramatic words, made life seem more vivid to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I must go now. Good-bye. I swear it. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was familiar with the atmosphere. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) breathed more freely, and for the first time for many months she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) really admired her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) son.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional scale, but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) cut her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) short. Trunks had to be carried down and mufflers looked for.
<p/>The lodging-house drudge bustled in and out. There was the bargaining with the cabman. The moment was lost in vulgar details.
<p/>It was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window, as her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) son drove away.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) consoled herself by telling Sibyl how desolate she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) life would be, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had only one child to look after.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) remembered the phrase. It had pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). Of the threat she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) said nothing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose you have heard the news, Basil?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry that evening as Hallward was shown into a little private room at the Bristol where dinner had been laid for three.
<p/>It was vividly and dramatically expressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) felt that they would all laugh at it some day. CHAPTER 6 '' No, Harry,'' answered the artist, giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hat and coat to the bowing waiter.
<p/>There is hardly a single person in the House of Commons worth painting, though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing.''
<p/>'' What is it? Nothing about politics, I hope! They don't interest me. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian Gray is engaged to be married,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spoke.
<p/>Hallward started and then frowned. '' Dorian engaged to be married! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cried. <div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is perfectly true. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To whom?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``To some little actress or other.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't believe it. Dorian is far too sensible.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>'' Dorian is far too wise not to do foolish things now and
<p/>then, my dear Basil. '' '' Marriage is hardly a thing that one can do now and then, Harry.'' <div class="bookquote">``Except in America,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>rejoined Lord Henry languidly.
<p/>'' But I didn't say he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was married. I said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was engaged to be married. There is a great difference.
<p/>I have a distinct remembrance of being married, but I have no recollection at all of being engaged. I am inclined to think that I never was engaged.''
<p/>'' But think of Dorian's birth, and position, and wealth. It would be absurd for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to marry so much beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).''
<p/>'' If you want to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) marry this girl, tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that, Basil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) is sure to do it, then.
<p/>Whenever a man does a thoroughly stupid thing, it is always from the noblest motives. '' <div class="bookquote">``I hope the girl is good, Harry.
<p/>I don't want to see Dorian tied to some vile creature, who might degrade his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) nature and ruin his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) intellect.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Oh, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is better than good--she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is beautiful,'' murmured Lord Henry, sipping a glass of vermouth and orange-bitters. '' Dorian says she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is beautiful, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is not often wrong about things of that kind.
<p/>Your portrait of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) has quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) appreciation of the personal appearance of other people. It has had that excellent effect, amongst others.
<p/>We are to see her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to-night, if that boy doesn't forget his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) appointment.'' <div class="bookquote">``Are you serious?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite serious, Basil. I should be miserable if I thought I should ever be more serious than I am at the present moment.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But do you approve of it, Harry? '' asked the painter, walking up and down the room and biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lip.
<p/>'' You can't approve of it, possibly. It is some silly infatuation.'' <div class="bookquote">``I never approve, or disapprove, of anything now. It is an absurd attitude to take towards life.
<p/>We are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices. I never take any notice of what common people say, and I never interfere with what charming people do.
<p/>If a personality fascinates me, whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me. Dorian Gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts Juliet, and proposes to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Why not? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wedded Messalina, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) would be none the less interesting. You know I am not a champion of marriage.
<p/>The real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish. And unselfish people are colourless. They lack individuality. Still, there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex.
<p/>They retain their egotism, and add to it many other egos. They are forced to have more than one life. They become more highly organized, and to be highly organized is, I should fancy, the object of man's existence.
<p/>I hope that Dorian Gray will make this girl his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wife, passionately adore her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for six months, and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else.
<p/>Besides, every experience is of value, and whatever one may say against marriage, it is certainly an experience. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) would be a wonderful study.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't mean a single word of all that, Harry; you know you don't. If Dorian Gray's life were spoiled, no one would be sorrier than yourself.
<p/>You are much better than you pretend to be. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>Lord Henry laughed. '' The reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves.
<p/>We think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us.
<p/>We praise the banker that we may overdraw our account, and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) may spare our pockets.
<p/>The basis of optimism is sheer terror. I mean everything that I have said. I have the greatest contempt for optimism.
<p/>As for a spoiled life, no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested. If you want to mar a nature, you have merely to reform it.
<p/>As for marriage, of course that would be silly, but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women.
<p/>I will certainly encourage them. They have the charm of being fashionable. But here is Dorian himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) will tell you more than I can.''
<p/>My dear Harry, my dear Basil, you must both congratulate me!'' said the lad, throwing off his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) evening cape with its satin-lined wings and shaking each of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) friends by the hand in turn.
<p/>'' '' I have never been so happy. Of course, it is sudden--all really delightful things are. And yet it seems to me to be the one thing I have been looking for all my life.
<p/>I hope you will always be very happy, Dorian,'' said Hallward, <div class="bookquote">``but I don't quite forgive you for not having let me know of your engagement.
<p/>And I don't forgive you for being late for dinner,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>broke in Lord Henry, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand on the lad's shoulder and smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spoke.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, let us sit down and try what the new chef here is like, and then you will tell us how it all came about.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>chef</b></font>) was flushed with excitement and pleasure, and looked extraordinarily handsome. '' You let Harry know. '' '' '' There is really not much to tell,'' cried Dorian as they took their seats at the small round table.
<p/>After I left you yesterday evening, Harry, I dressed, had some dinner at that little Italian restaurant in Rupert Street you introduced me to, and went down at eight o'clock to the theatre.
<p/>'' What happened was simply this. Sibyl was playing Rosalind. Of course, the scenery was dreadful and the Orlando absurd. But Sibyl!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) wore a moss-coloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves, slim, brown, cross-gartered hose, a dainty little green cap with a hawk's feather caught in a jewel, and a hooded cloak lined with dull red.
<p/>You should have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)! When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) came on in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) boy's clothes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was perfectly wonderful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had never seemed to me more exquisite.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had all the delicate grace of that Tanagra figurine that you have in your studio, Basil. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) hair clustered round her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) face like dark leaves round a pale rose.
<p/>As for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) acting--well, you shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) to-night. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is simply a born artist. I sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled.
<p/>I forgot that I was in London and in the nineteenth century. I was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen.
<p/>After the performance was over, I went behind and spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). As we were sitting together, suddenly there came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) eyes
<p/>a look that I had never seen there before. My lips moved towards hers. We kissed each other. I can't describe to you what I felt at that moment.
<p/>It seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rose-coloured joy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) flung herself on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) knees and kissed my hands. I feel that I should not tell you all this, but I can't help it.
<p/>Of course, our engagement is a dead secret. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) has not even told her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) own mother. I don't know what my guardians will say.
<p/>Lord Radley is sure to be furious. I don't care. I shall be of age in less than a year, and then I can do what I like.
<p/>I have been right, Basil, haven't I, to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in Shakespeare's plays?
<p/>Lips that Shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear. I have had the arms of Rosalind around me, and kissed Juliet on the mouth.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Dorian, I suppose you were right,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>said Hallward slowly. '' Have you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) to-day?'' asked Lord Henry. Dorian Gray shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) in the forest of Arden; I shall find her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) in an orchard in Verona. '' Lord Henry sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) champagne in a meditative manner.
<p/>'' At what particular point did you mention the word marriage, Dorian? And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) say in answer? Perhaps you forgot all about it.''
<p/>'' My dear Harry, I did not treat it as a business transaction, and I did not make any formal proposal.
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) that I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>) was not worthy to be my wife. Not worthy! Why, the whole world is nothing to me compared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Juliet</b></font>).''
<p/>'' Women are wonderfully practical,'' murmured Lord Henry, <div class="bookquote">``much more practical than we are. In situations of that kind we often forget to say anything about marriage, and they always remind us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) arm. '' Don't, Harry. You have annoyed Dorian. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is not like other men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) would never bring misery upon any one.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) nature is too fine for that.'' Lord Henry looked across the table. '' Dorian is never annoyed with me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered.
<p/>I asked the question for the best reason possible, for the only reason, indeed, that excuses one for asking any question--simple curiosity.
<p/>I have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us, and not we who propose to the women.
<p/>'' Except, of course, in middle-class life. But then the middle classes are not modern. '' Dorian Gray laughed, and tossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head.
<p/>When you see Sibyl Vane, you will feel that the man who could wrong her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) would be a beast, a beast without a heart.
<p/>'' You are quite incorrigible, Harry; but I don't mind. It is impossible to be angry with you. I cannot understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) loves.
<p/>I want to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine.
<p/>I love Sibyl Vane. What is marriage? An irrevocable vow. You mock at it for that. Ah! don't mock. It is an irrevocable vow that I want to take.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) trust makes me faithful, her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) belief makes me good. When I am with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>), I regret all that you have taught me.
<p/>I am changed, and the mere touch of Sibyl Vane's hand makes me forget you and all your wrong, fascinating, poisonous, delightful theories.''
<p/>I become different from what you have known me to be. '' And those are ...? '' asked Lord Henry, helping himself to some salad.
<p/>'' Oh, your theories about life, your theories about love, your theories about pleasure. All your theories, in fact, Harry. '' <div class="bookquote">``Pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) answered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slow melodious voice.
<p/>'' But I am afraid I cannot claim my theory as my own. It belongs to Nature, not to me. Pleasure is Nature's test, her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) sign of approval.
<p/>When we are happy, we are always good, but when we are good, we are not always happy.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! but what do you mean by good?
<p/>Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>echoed Dorian, leaning back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) chair and looking at Lord Henry over the heavy clusters of purple-lipped irises that stood in the centre of the table, <div class="bookquote">``what do you mean by good, Harry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>To be good is to be in harmony with one's self,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) replied, touching the thin stem of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) glass with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) pale, fine-pointed fingers.
<p/>'' cried Basil Hallward. '' '' '' Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life--that is the important thing.
<p/>As for the lives of one's neighbours, if one wishes to be a prig or a Puritan, one can flaunt one's moral views about them, but they are not one's concern.
<p/>I consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age is a form of the grossest immorality.''
<p/>But, surely, if one lives merely for one's self, Harry, one pays a terrible price for doing so?'' suggested the painter.
<p/>Besides, individualism has really the higher aim. Modern morality consists in accepting the standard of one's age. '' '' Yes, we are overcharged for everything nowadays.
<p/>I should fancy that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but self-denial. Beautiful sins, like beautiful things, are the privilege of the rich.''
<p/>'' One has to pay in other ways but money. '' <div class="bookquote">``What sort of ways, Basil? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! I should fancy in remorse, in suffering, in ...
<p/>well, in the consciousness of degradation. '' Lord Henry shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. '' My dear fellow, mediaeval art is charming, but mediaeval emotions are out of date.
<p/>But then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact.
<p/>One can use them in fiction, of course. Believe me, no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure, and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know what pleasure is,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray. '' It is to adore some one.'' '' That is certainly better than being adored,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) answered, toying with some fruits.
<p/>'' Being adored is a nuisance. Women treat us just as humanity treats its gods. They worship us, and are always bothering us to do something for them.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should have said that whatever they ask for they had first given to us,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>murmured the lad gravely. '' They create love in our natures.
<p/>They have a right to demand it back.'' '' That is quite true, Dorian,'' cried Hallward. '' Nothing is ever quite true,'' said Lord Henry.
<p/>'' This is,'' interrupted Dorian. '' You must admit, Harry, that women give to men the very gold of their lives.''
<p/>Women, as some witty Frenchman once put it, inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Possibly,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Frenchman</b></font>) sighed, ``but they invariably want it back in such very small change. That is the worry. <div class="bookquote">``Harry, you are dreadful!
<p/>I don't know why I like you so much.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will always like me, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) replied. '' Will you have some coffee, you fellows?
<p/>Waiter, bring coffee, and fine-champagne , and some cigarettes. No, don't mind the cigarettes--I have some. Basil, I can't allow you to smoke cigars.
<p/>You must have a cigarette. A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied.
<p/>What more can one want? Yes, Dorian, you will always be fond of me. I represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit.
<p/>'' '' What nonsense you talk, Harry! '' cried the lad, taking a light from a fire-breathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table.
<p/>``Let us go down to the theatre. When Sibyl comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have known everything,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, with a tired look in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">``but I am always ready for a new emotion.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) will represent something to you that you have never known. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>I am afraid, however, that, for me at any rate, there is no such thing.
<p/>Still, your wonderful girl may thrill me. I love acting. It is so much more real than life. Let us go.
<p/>Dorian, you will come with me. I am so sorry, Basil, but there is only room for two in the brougham.
<p/>You must follow us in a hansom. '' They got up and put on their coats, sipping their coffee standing. The painter was silent and preoccupied.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) could not bear this marriage, and yet it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) to be better than many other things that might have happened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) drove off by himself, as had been arranged, and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>).
<p/>There was a gloom over him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>). After a few minutes, they all passed downstairs. A strange sense of loss came over him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) felt that Dorian Gray would never again be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had been in the past. Life had come between them....
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes darkened, and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes. When the cab drew up at the theatre, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had grown years older.
<p/>For some reason or other, the house was crowded that night, and the fat Jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility, waving his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>manager</b></font>) voice.
<p/>CHAPTER 7 Dorian Gray loathed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) more than ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had come to look for Miranda and had been met by Caliban.
<p/>At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Miranda</b></font>) declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Miranda</b></font>) did, and insisted on shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Miranda</b></font>) by the hand and assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Miranda</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miranda</b></font>) was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet.
<p/>Lord Henry, upon the other hand, rather liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit. The heat was terribly oppressive, and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire.
<p/>The youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side. They talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them.
<p/>Some women were laughing in the pit. Their voices were horribly shrill and discordant. The sound of the popping of corks came from the bar.
<p/>'' What a place to find one's divinity in!'' said Lord Henry. '' Yes!'' answered Dorian Gray. '' It was here
<p/>I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is divine beyond all living things. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) acts, you will forget everything. These common rough people, with their coarse faces and brutal gestures, become quite different when she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is on the stage.
<p/>They sit silently and watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). They weep and laugh as she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wills them to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) makes them as responsive as a violin.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) spiritualizes them, and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as one's self. '' <div class="bookquote">``The same flesh and blood as one's self!
<p/>Oh, I hope not! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Lord Henry, who was scanning the occupants of the gallery through his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opera-glass. '' Don't pay any attention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), Dorian,'' said the painter.
<p/>Any one you love must be marvellous, and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble.
<p/>If this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly, if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is worthy of all your adoration, worthy of the adoration of the world.
<p/>'' I understand what you mean, and I believe in this girl. To spiritualize one's age--that is something worth doing. This marriage is quite right.
<p/>I did not think so at first, but I admit it now. The gods made Sibyl Vane for you. Without her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) you would have been incomplete.''
<p/>'' Thanks, Basil,'' answered Dorian Gray, pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand. '' I knew that you would understand me. Harry is so cynical, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) terrifies me.
<p/>Then the curtain rises, and you will see the girl to whom I am going to give all my life, to whom I have given everything that is good in me.
<p/>But here is the orchestra. It is quite dreadful, but it only lasts for about five minutes. '' A quarter of an hour afterwards, amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause, Sibyl Vane stepped on to the stage.
<p/>Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was certainly lovely to look at-- one of the loveliest creatures, Lord Henry thought, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had ever seen.
<p/>A faint blush, like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver, came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house.
<p/>There was something of the fawn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) shy grace and startled eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) stepped back a few paces and her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) lips seemed to tremble.
<p/>Basil Hallward leaped to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) feet and began to applaud. Motionless, and as one in a dream, sat Dorian Gray, gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>).
<p/>The scene was the hall of Capulet's house, and Romeo in his (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) pilgrim's dress had entered with Mercutio and his (<font color='blue'><b>Romeo</b></font>) other friends.
<p/>Lord Henry peered through his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) glasses, murmuring, <div class="bookquote">``Charming! charming!''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>The band, such as it was, struck up a few bars of music, and the dance began.
<p/>Through the crowd of ungainly, shabbily dressed actors, Sibyl Vane moved like a creature from a finer world. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) body swayed, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) danced, as a plant sways in the water.
<p/>The curves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) throat were the curves of a white lily. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) hands seemed to be made of cool ivory.
<p/>Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was curiously listless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) showed no sign of joy when her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) eyes rested on Romeo. The few words she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) had to speak-- Good pilgrim
<p/>Which mannerly devotion shows in this; For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss-- with the brief dialogue that follows, were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner.
<p/>, you do wrong your hand too much, The voice was exquisite, but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false.
<p/>It was wrong in colour. It took away all the life from the verse. It made the passion unreal. Dorian Gray grew pale as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) watched her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was puzzled and anxious. Neither of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) friends dared to say anything to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seemed to them to be absolutely incompetent.
<p/>They were horribly disappointed. Yet they felt that the true test of any Juliet is the balcony scene of the second act.
<p/>They waited for that. If she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) failed there, there was nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) looked charming as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) came out in the moonlight.
<p/>That could not be denied. But the staginess of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) acting was unbearable, and grew worse as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went on. Her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gestures became absurdly artificial.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) overemphasized everything that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had to say. The beautiful passage-- Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face
<p/>For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night-- was declaimed with the painful precision of a schoolgirl who has been taught to recite by some second-rate professor of elocution.
<p/>, Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek When she (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>) leaned over the balcony and came to those wonderful lines--
<p/>: It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden; Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be Ere one can say, <div class="bookquote">``It lightens.
<p/>This bud of love by summer's ripening breath May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet-- she (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>) spoke the words as though they conveyed no meaning to her (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>).
<p/>Although I joy in thee, I have no joy of this contract to-night ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Sweet, good-night! It was not nervousness. Indeed, so far from being nervous, she (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>) was absolutely self-contained.
<p/>It was simply bad art. She (<font color='blue'><b>schoolgirl</b></font>) was a complete failure. Even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play.
<p/>They got restless, and began to talk loudly and to whistle. The Jew manager, who was standing at the back of the dress-circle, stamped and swore with rage.
<p/>When the second act was over, there came a storm of hisses, and Lord Henry got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chair and put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) coat.
<p/>The only person unmoved was the girl herself. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is quite beautiful, Dorian,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can't act. Let us go.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am going to see the play through,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>answered the lad, in a hard bitter voice. '' I am awfully sorry that I have made you waste an evening, Harry.
<p/>I apologize to you both.'' '' My dear Dorian, I should think Miss Vane was ill,'' interrupted Hallward. '' We will come some other night.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) rejoined. '' But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seems to me to be simply callous and cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has entirely altered.
<p/>Last night she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a great artist. This evening she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is merely a commonplace mediocre actress. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't talk like that about any one you love, Dorian.
<p/>Love is a more wonderful thing than art. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>'' They are both simply forms of imitation,'' remarked Lord Henry. ''
<p/>But do let us go. Dorian, you must not stay here any longer. It is not good for one's morals to see bad acting.
<p/>Besides, I don't suppose you will want your wife to act, so what does it matter if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) plays Juliet like a wooden doll?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is very lovely, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knows as little about life as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does about acting, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will be a delightful experience.
<p/>There are only two kinds of people who are really fascinating--people who know absolutely everything, and people who know absolutely nothing.
<p/>Good heavens, my dear boy, don't look so tragic! The secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming.
<p/>Come to the club with Basil and myself. We will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of Sibyl Vane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) is beautiful.
<p/>What more can you want?'' <div class="bookquote">``Go away, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad. '' I want to be alone. Basil, you must go.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) lips trembled, and rushing to the back of the box, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) leaned up against the wall, hiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) hands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let us go, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry with a strange tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) voice, and the two young men passed out together.
<p/>Ah! can't you see that my heart is breaking? '' The hot tears came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes. A few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose on the third act.
<p/>Dorian Gray went back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) seat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) looked pale, and proud, and indifferent. The play dragged on, and seemed interminable.
<p/>Half of the audience went out, tramping in heavy boots and laughing. The whole thing was a fiasco . The last act was played to almost empty benches.
<p/>The curtain went down on a titter and some groans. As soon as it was over, Dorian Gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom.
<p/>The girl was standing there alone, with a look of triumph on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes were lit with an exquisite fire.
<p/>There was a radiance about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), and an expression of infinite joy came over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>'' How badly I acted to-night, Dorian! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried. '' Horribly!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered, gazing at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in amazement. <div class="bookquote">``Horribly! It was dreadful.
<p/>Are you ill? You have no idea what it was. You have no idea what I suffered. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The girl smiled.
<p/>Dorian,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, lingering over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) name with long-drawn music in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice, as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>'' '' Dorian, you should have understood. But you understand now, don't you?'' <div class="bookquote">``Understand what? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) asked, angrily. '' Why I was so bad to-night.
<p/>Why I shall always be bad. Why I shall never act well again. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shoulders. '' You are ill, I suppose.
<p/>When you are ill you shouldn't act. You make yourself ridiculous. My friends were bored. I was bored. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed not to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was transfigured with joy. An ecstasy of happiness dominated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). '' Dorian, Dorian,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``before I knew you, acting was the one reality of my life.
<p/>It was only in the theatre that I lived. I thought that it was all true. I was Rosalind one night and Portia the other.
<p/>The joy of Beatrice was my joy, and the sorrows of Cordelia were mine also. I believed in everything. The common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike.
<p/>The painted scenes were my world. I knew nothing but shadows, and I thought them real. You came-- oh, my beautiful love!--and you freed my soul from prison.
<p/>To-night, for the first time in my life, I saw through the hollowness, the sham, the silliness of the empty pageant in which I had always played.
<p/>To-night, for the first time, I became conscious that the Romeo was hideous, and old, and painted, that the moonlight in the orchard was false, that the scenery was vulgar, and that the words I had to speak were unreal, were not my words, were not what I wanted to say.
<p/>You taught me what reality really is. You had brought me something higher, something of which all art is but a reflection.
<p/>You had made me understand what love really is. My love! My love! Prince Charming! Prince of life! I have grown sick of shadows.
<p/>You are more to me than all art can ever be. What have I to do with the puppets of a play?
<p/>When I came on to-night, I could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me. I thought that I was going to be wonderful.
<p/>I found that I could do nothing. Suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant. The knowledge was exquisite to me.
<p/>I heard them hissing, and I smiled. What could they know of love such as ours? Take me away, Dorian--take me away with you, where we can be quite alone.
<p/>I hate the stage. I might mimic a passion that I do not feel, but I cannot mimic one that burns me like fire.
<p/>Oh, Dorian, Dorian, you understand now what it signifies? Even if I could do it, it would be profanation for me to play at being in love.
<p/>You have made me see that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) flung himself down on the sofa and turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) face. '' You have killed my love,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) muttered.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) in wonder and laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) made no answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) came across to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>), and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) little fingers stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hair.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) knelt down and pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) lips. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) drew them away, and a shudder ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) leaped up and went to the door.
<p/>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``you have killed my love. You used to stir my imagination. Now you don't even stir my curiosity.
<p/>I loved you because you were marvellous, because you had genius and intellect, because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art.
<p/>You simply produce no effect. You have thrown it all away. You are shallow and stupid. My God! how mad I was to love you!
<p/>What a fool I have been! You are nothing to me now. I will never see you again. I will never think of you.
<p/>I will never mention your name. You don't know what you were to me, once. Why, once ... Oh, I can't bear to think of it!
<p/>I wish I had never laid eyes upon you! You have spoiled the romance of my life. How little you can know of love, if you say it mars your art!
<p/>Without your art, you are nothing. I would have made you famous, splendid, magnificent. The world would have worshipped you, and you would have borne my name.
<p/>What are you now? A third-rate actress with a pretty face. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The girl grew white, and trembled. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) clenched her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hands together, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) voice seemed to catch in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) throat.
<p/>'' You are not serious, Dorian? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) murmured. '' You are acting. '' <div class="bookquote">``Acting! I leave that to you. You do it so well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered bitterly.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) rose from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knees and, with a piteous expression of pain in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face, came across the room to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) arm and looked into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) back. '' Don't touch me! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cried.
<p/>A low moan broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) flung herself at his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) feet and lay there like a trampled flower. ''
<p/>Dorian, Dorian, don't leave me!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whispered. '' I am so sorry I didn't act well. I was thinking of you all the time.
<p/>But I will try--indeed, I will try. It came so suddenly across me, my love for you. I think I should never have known it if you had not kissed me--if we had not kissed each other.
<p/>Kiss me again, my love. Don't go away from me. I couldn't bear it. Oh! don't go away from me. My brother ...
<p/>No; never mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) didn't mean it. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was in jest.... But you, oh! can't you forgive me for to-night? I will work so hard and try to improve.
<p/>Don't be cruel to me, because I love you better than anything in the world. After all, it is only once that I have not pleased you.
<p/>But you are quite right, Dorian. I should have shown myself more of an artist. It was foolish of me, and yet I couldn't help it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) crouched on the floor like a wounded thing, and Dorian Gray, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) beautiful eyes, looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain.
<p/>Oh, don't leave me, don't leave me. '' A fit of passionate sobbing choked her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). There is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love.
<p/>Sibyl Vane seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to be absurdly melodramatic. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) tears and sobs annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). '' I am going,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) said at last in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) calm clear voice.
<p/>'' I don't wish to be unkind, but I can't see you again. You have disappointed me. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) wept silently, and made no answer, but crept nearer.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) little hands stretched blindly out, and appeared to be seeking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) turned on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) heel and left the room.
<p/>In a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was out of the theatre. Where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) went to he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hardly knew. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) remembered wandering through dimly lit streets, past gaunt, black-shadowed archways and evil-looking houses.
<p/>Women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). Drunkards had reeled by, cursing and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had seen grotesque children huddled upon door-steps, and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts. As the dawn was just breaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) found himself close to Covent Garden.
<p/>The darkness lifted, and, flushed with faint fires, the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl. Huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street.
<p/>The air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers, and their beauty seemed to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) an anodyne for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) pain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons. A white-smocked carter offered him (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) some cherries. He (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>), wondered why he (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>) refused to accept any money for them, and began to eat them listlessly.
<p/>A long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips, and of yellow and red roses, defiled in front of him (<font color='blue'><b>carter</b></font>), threading their way through the huge, jade-green piles of vegetables.
<p/>Under the portico, with its grey, sun-bleached pillars, loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls, waiting for the auction to be over.
<p/>They had been plucked at midnight, and the coldness of the moon had entered into them. Others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffee-house in the piazza.
<p/>The heavy cart-horses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones, shaking their bells and trappings. Some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks.
<p/>Iris-necked and pink-footed, the pigeons ran about picking up seeds. After a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Others</b></font>) hailed a hansom and drove home.
<p/>For a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Others</b></font>) loitered upon the doorstep, looking round at the silent square, with its blank, close-shuttered windows and its staring blinds.
<p/>The sky was pure opal now, and the roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it. From some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising.
<p/>In the huge gilt Venetian lantern, spoil of some Doge's barge, that hung from the ceiling of the great, oak-panelled hall of entrance, lights were still burning from three flickering jets: thin blue petals of flame they seemed, rimmed with white fire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) turned them out and, having thrown his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hat and cape on the table, passed through the library towards the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bedroom, a large octagonal chamber on the ground floor that, in his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) new-born feeling for luxury, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had just had decorated for himself and hung with some curious Renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at Selby Royal.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) was turning the handle of the door, his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) eye fell upon the portrait Basil Hallward had painted of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>).
<p/>It curled, a violet riband, through the nacre-coloured air. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) started back as if in surprise. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) went on into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own room, looking somewhat puzzled.
<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had taken the button-hole out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) coat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) seemed to hesitate. Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) came back, went over to the picture, and examined it.
<p/>In the dim arrested light that struggled through the cream-coloured silk blinds, the face appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) to be a little changed.
<p/>The expression looked different. One would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth. It was certainly strange.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) turned round and, walking to the window, drew up the blind. The bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners, where they lay shuddering.
<p/>But the strange expression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there, to be more intensified even.
<p/>The quivering ardent sunlight showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had been looking into a mirror after he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had done some dreadful thing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) winced and, taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory Cupids, one of Lord Henry's many presents to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), glanced hurriedly into its polished depths.
<p/>No line like that warped his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) red lips. What did it mean? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rubbed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyes, and came close to the picture, and examined it again.
<p/>There were no signs of any change when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked into the actual painting, and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had altered.
<p/>It was not a mere fancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own. The thing was horribly apparent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) threw himself into a chair and began to think.
<p/>Suddenly there flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mind what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had said in Basil Hallward's studio the day the picture had been finished.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had uttered a mad wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) himself might remain young, and the portrait grow old; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own beauty might be untarnished, and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) passions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sins; that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) then just conscious boyhood.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remembered it perfectly. Surely his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wish had not been fulfilled? Such things were impossible. It seemed monstrous even to think of them.
<p/>And, yet, there was the picture before him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), with the touch of cruelty in the mouth. Cruelty! Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) been cruel?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had dreamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as a great artist, had given his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) great.
<p/>And, yet, a feeling of infinite regret came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lying at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) feet sobbing like a little child.
<p/>It was the girl's fault, not his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had disappointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been shallow and unworthy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remembered with what callousness he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) been made like that? Why had such a soul been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)? But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had suffered also.
<p/>During the three terrible hours that the play had lasted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had lived centuries of pain, aeon upon aeon of torture.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life was well worth hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had marred him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for a moment, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had wounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for an age.
<p/>Besides, women were better suited to bear sorrow than men. They lived on their emotions. They only thought of their emotions.
<p/>When they took lovers, it was merely to have some one with whom they could have scenes. Lord Henry had told him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that, and Lord Henry knew what women were.
<p/>Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) trouble about Sibyl Vane? She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) now. But the picture? What was he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to say of that?
<p/>It held the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life, and told his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) story. It had taught him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to love his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own beauty. Would it teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to loathe his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own soul?
<p/>Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ever look at it again? No; it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses. The horrible night that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had passed had left phantoms behind it.
<p/>Suddenly there had fallen upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad. The picture had not changed. It was folly to think so.
<p/>Yet it was watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile. Its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight.
<p/>Its blue eyes met his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own. A sense of infinite pity, not for himself, but for the painted image of himself, came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>It had altered already, and would alter more. Its gold would wither into grey. Its red and white roses would die.
<p/>For every sin that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) committed, a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would not sin. The picture, changed or unchanged, would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the visible emblem of conscience.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would not see Lord Henry any more--would not, at any rate, listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in Basil Hallward's garden had first stirred within him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) the passion for impossible things.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would resist temptation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would go back to Sibyl Vane, make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) amends, marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), try to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) again.
<p/>Yes, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) duty to do so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) must have suffered more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had. Poor child! He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had been selfish and cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).
<p/>The fascination that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had exercised over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would return. They would be happy together. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) life with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) would be beautiful and pure.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) got up from his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) chair and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait, shuddering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) glanced at it.
<p/>'' How horrible! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) murmured to himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) walked across to the window and opened it. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) stepped out on to the grass, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) drew a deep breath.
<p/>The fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) sombre passions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) thought only of Sibyl. A faint echo of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) love came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) name over and over again. The birds that were singing in the dew-drenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) valet had crept several times on tiptoe into the room to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was stirring, and had wondered what made his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) young master sleep so late.
<p/>Finally his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) bell sounded, and Victor came in softly with a cup of tea, and a pile of letters, on a small tray of old Sevres china, and drew back the olive-satin curtains, with their shimmering blue lining, that hung in front of the three tall windows.
<p/>CHAPTER 8 It was long past noon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) awoke. '' Monsieur has well slept this morning,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) said, smiling. ''
<p/>What o'clock is it, Victor?'' asked Dorian Gray drowsily. '' One hour and a quarter, Monsieur. '' How late it was!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) sat up, and having sipped some tea, turned over his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) letters. One of them was from Lord Henry, and had been brought by hand that morning.
<p/>They contained the usual collection of cards, invitations to dinner, tickets for private views, programmes of charity concerts, and the like that are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the season.
<p/>There was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver Louis-Quinze toilet-set that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had not yet had the courage to send on to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) guardians, who were extremely old-fashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities; and there were several very courteously worded communications from Jermyn Street money-lenders offering to advance any sum of money at a moment's notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest.
<p/>After about ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) got up, and throwing on an elaborate dressing-gown of silk-embroidered cashmere wool, passed into the onyx-paved bathroom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hesitated for a moment, and then put it aside. The others he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opened listlessly. The cool water refreshed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) after his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) long sleep.
<p/>A dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) once or twice, but there was the unreality of a dream about it.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was dressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) went into the library and sat down to a light French breakfast that had been laid out for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) on a small round table close to the open window.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seemed to have forgotten all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had gone through. It was an exquisite day. The warm air seemed laden with spices.
<p/>A bee flew in and buzzed round the blue-dragon bowl that, filled with sulphur-yellow roses, stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt perfectly happy.
<p/>Suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eye fell on the screen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had placed in front of the portrait, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) started. '' Too cold for Monsieur?'' asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) valet, putting an omelette on the table.
<p/>'' I shut the window? '' Dorian shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head. '' I am not cold,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured. Was it all true?
<p/>Or had it been simply his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own imagination that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) see a look of evil where there had been a look of joy?
<p/>Had the portrait really changed? Surely a painted canvas could not alter? The thing was absurd. It would serve as a tale to tell Basil some day.
<p/>First in the dim twilight, and then in the bright dawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had seen the touch of cruelty round the warped lips.
<p/>It would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) smile. And, yet, how vivid was his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) recollection of the whole thing! He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) almost dreaded his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) valet leaving the room.
<p/>When the coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt a wild desire to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to remain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was alone he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have to examine the portrait. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was afraid of certainty. As the door was closing behind him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back.
<p/>The man stood waiting for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) orders. Dorian looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) for a moment. '' I am not at home to any one, Victor,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) said with a sigh.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) rose from the table, lit a cigarette, and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen.
<p/>The man bowed and retired. The screen was an old one, of gilt Spanish leather, stamped and wrought with a rather florid Louis-Quatorze pattern.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) scanned it curiously, wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a man's life. Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) move it aside, after all?
<p/>Why not let it stay there? What was the use of knowing? If the thing was true, it was terrible. If it was not true, why trouble about it?
<p/>But what if, by some fate or deadlier chance, eyes other than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spied behind and saw the horrible change? What should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do if Basil Hallward came and asked to look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own picture?
<p/>Basil would be sure to do that. No; the thing had to be examined, and at once. Anything would be better than this dreadful state of doubt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) got up and locked both doors. At least he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) would be alone when he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) looked upon the mask of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) shame.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) often remembered afterwards, and always with no small wonder, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) drew the screen aside and saw himself face to face. It was perfectly true. The portrait had altered. That such a change should have taken place was incredible to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>).
<p/>Was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)?
<p/>And yet it was a fact. Could it be that what that soul thought, they realized?--that what it dreamed, they made true?
<p/>Or was there some other, more terrible reason? He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) shuddered, and felt afraid, and, going back to the couch, lay there, gazing at the picture in sickened horror.
<p/>One thing, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) felt that it had done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). It had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) conscious how unjust, how cruel, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had been to Sibyl Vane.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence, would be transformed into some nobler passion, and the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would be a guide to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) through life, would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) what holiness is to some, and conscience to others, and the fear of God to us all.
<p/>It was not too late to make reparation for that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) could still be his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wife. There were opiates for remorse, drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep.
<p/>But here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin. Here was an ever-present sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern; to find his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was wandering.
<p/>Three o'clock struck, and four, and the half-hour rang its double chime, but Dorian Gray did not stir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) did not know what to do, or what to think.
<p/>Finally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had loved, imploring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forgiveness and accusing himself of madness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of pain. There is a luxury in self-reproach.
<p/>When we blame ourselves, we feel that no one else has a right to blame us. It is the confession, not the priest, that gives us absolution.
<p/>When Dorian had finished the letter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had been forgiven. Suddenly there came a knock to the door, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heard Lord Henry's voice outside.
<p/>'' My dear boy, I must see you. Let me in at once. I can't bear your shutting yourself up like this.
<p/>Yes, it was better to let Lord Henry in, and to explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the new life he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was going to lead, to quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) if it became necessary to quarrel, to part if parting was inevitable.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) made no answer at first, but remained quite still. The knocking still continued and grew louder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) jumped up, drew the screen hastily across the picture, and unlocked the door.
<p/>'' I am so sorry for it all, Dorian,'' said Lord Henry as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) entered. '' But you must not think too much about it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you mean about Sibyl Vane?''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>asked the lad. '' Yes, of course,'' answered Lord Henry, sinking into a chair and slowly pulling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) yellow gloves.
<p/>'' It is dreadful, from one point of view, but it was not your fault. Tell me, did you go behind and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>), after the play was over?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I felt sure you had. Did you make a scene with her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I was brutal, Harry--perfectly brutal. But it is all right now.
<p/>I am not sorry for anything that has happened. It has taught me to know myself better.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, Dorian, I am so glad you take it in that way!
<p/>I was afraid I would find you plunged in remorse and tearing that nice curly hair of yours. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have got through all that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head and smiling.
<p/>'' I am perfectly happy now. I know what conscience is, to begin with. It is not what you told me it was.
<p/>It is the divinest thing in us. Don't sneer at it, Harry, any more--at least not before me. I want to be good.
<p/>I can't bear the idea of my soul being hideous.'' <div class="bookquote">``A very charming artistic basis for ethics, Dorian! I congratulate you on it.
<p/>But how are you going to begin?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl Vane/Sibyl</b></font>)</div>'' By marrying Sibyl Vane.'' <div class="bookquote">``Marrying Sibyl Vane! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, standing up and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in perplexed amazement.
<p/>'' But, my dear Dorian--'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Harry, I know what you are going to say. Something dreadful about marriage. Don't say it.
<p/>Don't ever say things of that kind to me again. Two days ago I asked Sibyl to marry me. I am not going to break my word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is to be my wife. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your wife! Dorian! ... Didn't you get my letter? I wrote to you this morning, and sent the note down by my own man.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Your letter? Oh, yes, I remember. I have not read it yet, Harry. I was afraid there might be something in it that I wouldn't like.
<p/>Lord Henry walked across the room, and sitting down by Dorian Gray, took both his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own and held them tightly.
<p/>You cut life to pieces with your epigrams.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know nothing then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What do you mean? '' '' Dorian,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``my letter--don't be frightened--was to tell you that Sibyl Vane is dead.
<p/>A cry of pain broke from the lad's lips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) leaped to his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) feet, tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hands away from Lord Henry's grasp.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Dead! Sibyl dead! It is not true! It is a horrible lie! How dare you say it?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is quite true, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, gravely.
<p/>'' It is in all the morning papers. I wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till I came.
<p/>There will have to be an inquest, of course, and you must not be mixed up in it. Things like that make a man fashionable in Paris.
<p/>But in London people are so prejudiced. Here, one should never make one's debut with a scandal. One should reserve that to give an interest to one's old age.
<p/>I suppose they don't know your name at the theatre? If they don't, it is all right. Did any one see you going round to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) room?
<p/>That is an important point. '' Dorian did not answer for a few moments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was dazed with horror. Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) stammered, in a stifled voice, <div class="bookquote">``Harry, did you say an inquest?
<p/>What did you mean by that? Did Sibyl--? Oh, Harry, I can't bear it! But be quick. Tell me everything at once.
<p/>I have no doubt it was not an accident, Dorian, though it must be put in that way to the public.
<p/>It seems that as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was leaving the theatre with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) mother, about half-past twelve or so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had forgotten something upstairs.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' They waited some time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) did not come down again. They ultimately found her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) lying dead on the floor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) dressing-room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had swallowed something by mistake, some dreadful thing they use at theatres. I don't know what it was, but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it.
<p/>I should fancy it was prussic acid, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) seems to have died instantaneously.'' <div class="bookquote">``Harry, Harry, it is terrible!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad.
<p/>'' Yes; it is very tragic, of course, but you must not get yourself mixed up in it. I see by The Standard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was seventeen.
<p/>I should have thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was almost younger than that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) looked such a child, and seemed to know so little about acting.
<p/>Dorian, you mustn't let this thing get on your nerves. You must come and dine with me, and afterwards we will look in at the opera.
<p/>It is a Patti night, and everybody will be there. You can come to my sister's box. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has got some smart women with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).''
<p/>So I have murdered Sibyl Vane,'' said Dorian Gray, half to himself, <div class="bookquote">``murdered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) as surely as if I had cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) little throat with a knife.
<p/>And to-night I am to dine with you, and then go on to the opera, and sup somewhere, I suppose, afterwards.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>Yet the roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden. How extraordinarily dramatic life is!
<p/>If I had read all this in a book, Harry, I think I would have wept over it. Somehow, now that it has happened actually, and to me, it seems far too wonderful for tears.
<p/>Here is the first passionate love-letter I have ever written in my life. Strange, that my first passionate love-letter should have been addressed to a dead girl.
<p/>Can they feel, I wonder, those white silent people we call the dead? Sibyl! Can she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) feel, or know, or listen?
<p/>Oh, Harry, how I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) once! It seems years ago to me now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was everything to me. Then came that dreadful night--was it really only last night?--when
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) played so badly, and my heart almost broke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) explained it all to me. It was terribly pathetic. But I was not moved a bit.
<p/>I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) shallow. Suddenly something happened that made me afraid. I can't tell you what it was, but it was terrible.
<p/>I said I would go back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). I felt I had done wrong. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) is dead. My God!
<p/>My God! Harry, what shall I do? You don't know the danger I am in, and there is nothing to keep me straight.
<p/>My dear Dorian,'' answered Lord Henry, taking a cigarette from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) case and producing a gold-latten matchbox, <div class="bookquote">``the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so completely that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loses all possible interest in life.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have done that for me. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no right to kill herself. It was selfish of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>'' If you had married this girl, you would have been wretched.
<p/>Of course, you would have treated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) kindly. One can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing. But she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>And when a woman finds that out about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) either becomes dreadfully dowdy, or wears very smart bonnets that some other woman's husband has to pay for.
<p/>I say nothing about the social mistake, which would have been abject--which, of course, I would not have allowed--but I assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I suppose it would,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>muttered the lad, walking up and down the room and looking horribly pale. '' But I thought it was my duty.
<p/>It is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right. I remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutions--that they are always made too late.
<p/>Mine certainly were.'' ``Good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws. Their origin is pure vanity. Their result is absolutely nil .
<p/>They give us, now and then, some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak. That is all that can be said for them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian Gray, coming over and sitting down beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``why is it that I cannot feel this tragedy as much as I want to?
<p/>They are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account.''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I don't think I am heartless.
<p/>You have done too many foolish things during the last fortnight to be entitled to give yourself that name, Dorian,'' answered Lord Henry with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sweet melancholy smile.
<p/>Do you?'' '' The lad frowned. '' I don't like that explanation, Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) rejoined, ``but I am glad you don't think I am heartless.
<p/>I am nothing of the kind. I know I am not. And yet I must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should.
<p/>It has all the terrible beauty of a Greek tragedy, a tragedy in which I took a great part, but by which I have not been wounded.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is an interesting question,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lad's unconscious egotism, <div class="bookquote">``an extremely interesting question.
<p/>It seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>I fancy that the true explanation is this
<p/>: It often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence, their absolute incoherence, their absurd want of meaning, their entire lack of style.
<p/>They affect us just as vulgarity affects us. They give us an impression of sheer brute force, and we revolt against that.
<p/>Sometimes, however, a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives. If these elements of beauty are real, the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect.
<p/>Suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors, but the spectators of the play. Or rather we are both.
<p/>We watch ourselves, and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us. In the present case, what is it that has really happened?
<p/>Some one has killed herself for love of you. I wish that I had ever had such an experience. It would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life.
<p/>The people who have adored me--there have not been very many, but there have been some--have always insisted on living on, long after I had ceased to care for them, or they to care for me.
<p/>They have become stout and tedious, and when I meet them, they go in at once for reminiscences. That awful memory of woman!
<p/>What a fearful thing it is! And what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals! One should absorb the colour of life, but one should never remember its details.
<p/>Details are always vulgar. '' <div class="bookquote">``I must sow poppies in my garden,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>sighed Dorian. '' There is no necessity,'' rejoined his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) companion.
<p/>I once wore nothing but violets all through one season, as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die.
<p/>'' Life has always poppies in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands. Of course, now and then things linger. Ultimately, however, it did die. I forget what killed it.
<p/>I think it was her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me. That is always a dreadful moment. It fills one with the terror of eternity.
<p/>, I found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) insisted on going over the whole thing again, and digging up the past, and raking up the future.
<p/>Well--would you believe it?--a week ago, at Lady Hampshire's I had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) dragged it out again and assured me that I had spoiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) life.
<p/>I am bound to state that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) ate an enormous dinner, so I did not feel any anxiety. But what a lack of taste she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) showed!
<p/>The one charm of the past is that it is the past. But women never know when the curtain has fallen.
<p/>They always want a sixth act, and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over, they propose to continue it.
<p/>If they were allowed their own way, every comedy would have a tragic ending, and every tragedy would culminate in a farce.
<p/>I assure you, Dorian, that not one of the women I have known would have done for me what Sibyl Vane did for you.
<p/>They are charmingly artificial, but they have no sense of art. You are more fortunate than I am. Ordinary women always console themselves.
<p/>Never trust a woman who wears mauve, whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) age may be, or a woman over thirty-five who is fond of pink ribbons.
<p/>Some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours. It always means that they have a history. Others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands.
<p/>They flaunt their conjugal felicity in one's face, as if it were the most fascinating of sins. Religion consoles some. Its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation, a woman once told me, and I can quite understand it.
<p/>Besides, nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all. Yes; there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life.
<p/>Indeed, I have not mentioned the most important one.'' '' What is that, Harry?'' said the lad listlessly. '' Oh, the obvious consolation.
<p/>Taking some one else's admirer when one loses one's own. In good society that always whitewashes a woman. But really, Dorian, how different Sibyl Vane must have been from all the women one meets!
<p/>There is something to me quite beautiful about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) death. I am glad I am living in a century when such wonders happen.
<p/>They make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with, such as romance, passion, and love. ''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was terribly cruel to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>). You forget that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, downright cruelty, more than anything else.
<p/>They have wonderfully primitive instincts. We have emancipated them, but they remain slaves looking for their masters, all the same. They love being dominated.
<p/>I am sure you were splendid. I have never seen you really and absolutely angry, but I can fancy how delightful you looked.
<p/>And, after all, you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful, but that I see now was absolutely true, and it holds the key to everything.
<p/>You said to me that Sibyl Vane represented to you all the heroines of romance--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was Desdemona one night, and Ophelia the other; that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) died as Juliet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) came to life as Imogen.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>'' What was that, Harry?'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) will never come to life again now,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>muttered the lad, burying his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hands.
<p/>But you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressing-room simply as a strange lurid fragment from some Jacobean tragedy, as a wonderful scene from Webster, or Ford, or Cyril Tourneur.
<p/>'' No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) will never come to life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) has played her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) last part. The girl never really lived, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) has never really died.
<p/>To you at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) was always a dream, a phantom that flitted through Shakespeare's plays and left them lovelier for its presence, a reed through which Shakespeare's music sounded richer and more full of joy.
<p/>The moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) touched actual life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) marred it, and it marred her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>), and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) passed away. Mourn for Ophelia, if you like.
<p/>Put ashes on your head because Cordelia was strangled. Cry out against Heaven because the daughter of Brabantio died. But don't waste your tears over Sibyl Vane.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was less real than they are. '' There was a silence. The evening darkened in the room. Noiselessly, and with silver feet, the shadows crept in from the garden.
<p/>The colours faded wearily out of things. After some time Dorian Gray looked up. '' You have explained me to myself, Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) murmured with something of a sigh of relief.
<p/>I felt all that you have said, but somehow I was afraid of it, and I could not express it to myself.
<p/>'' How well you know me! But we will not talk again of what has happened. It has been a marvellous experience.
<p/>That is all. I wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous.'' <div class="bookquote">``Life has everything in store for you, Dorian.
<p/>There is nothing that you, with your extraordinary good looks, will not be able to do.''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>'' But suppose, Harry, I became haggard, and old, and wrinkled?
<p/>What then?'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, rising to go, <div class="bookquote">``then, my dear Dorian, you would have to fight for your victories.
<p/>As it is, they are brought to you. No, you must keep your good looks. We live in an age that reads too much to be wise, and that thinks too much to be beautiful.
<p/>We cannot spare you. And now you had better dress and drive down to the club. We are rather late, as it is.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I shall join you at the opera, Harry. I feel too tired to eat anything. What is the number of your sister's box?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty-seven, I believe. It is on the grand tier. You will see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) name on the door. But I am sorry you won't come and dine.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't feel up to it,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian listlessly. '' But I am awfully obliged to you for all that you have said to me.
<p/>You are certainly my best friend. No one has ever understood me as you have. '' <div class="bookquote">``We are only at the beginning of our friendship, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>answered Lord Henry, shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) by the hand.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), Dorian Gray touched the bell, and in a few minutes Victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down.
<p/>'' Good-bye. I shall see you before nine-thirty, I hope. Remember, Patti is singing. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) waited impatiently for him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) to go.
<p/>The man seemed to take an interminable time over everything. As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) rushed to the screen and drew it back.
<p/>No; there was no further change in the picture. It had received the news of Sibyl Vane's death before he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had known of it himself.
<p/>The vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had, no doubt, appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison, whatever it was.
<p/>It was conscious of the events of life as they occurred. Or was it indifferent to results? Did it merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) wondered, and hoped that some day he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would see the change taking place before his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) very eyes, shuddering as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) hoped it.
<p/>Poor Sibyl! What a romance it had all been! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had often mimicked death on the stage. Then Death himself had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) and taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) with him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>).
<p/>How had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) played that dreadful last scene? Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) died? No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had died for love of him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>), and love would always be a sacrament to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would not think any more of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) go through, on that horrible night at the theatre.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>), it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent on to the world's stage to show the supreme reality of love.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had atoned for everything by the sacrifice she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) life. A wonderful tragic figure? Tears came to his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) eyes as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) childlike look, and winsome fanciful ways, and shy tremulous grace.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) felt that the time had really come for making his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) choice.
<p/>Or had his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) choice already been made? Yes, life had decided that for him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>)--life, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) own infinite curiosity about life.
<p/>Eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins--he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) was to have all these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) shame: that was all.
<p/>A feeling of pain crept over him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) thought of the desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas.
<p/>Once, in boyish mockery of Narcissus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had kissed, or feigned to kiss, those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>).
<p/>Morning after morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty, almost enamoured of it, as it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) at times.
<p/>Was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing, to be hidden away in a locked room, to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair?
<p/>Was it to alter now with every mood to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) yielded? The pity of it! the pity of it! For a moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) and the picture might cease.
<p/>And yet, who, that knew anything about life, would surrender the chance of remaining always young, however fantastic that chance might be, or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught?
<p/>It had changed in answer to a prayer; perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged. Besides, was it really under his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) control?
<p/>Had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution? Might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all?
<p/>If thought could exercise its influence upon a living organism, might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic things?
<p/>Nay, without thought or conscious desire, might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions, atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity?
<p/>But the reason was of no importance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power. If the picture was to alter, it was to alter.
<p/>That was all. Why inquire too closely into it? For there would be a real pleasure in watching it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would be able to follow his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) mind into its secret places.
<p/>This portrait would be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) the most magical of mirrors. As it had revealed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) own body, so it would reveal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) own soul.
<p/>When the blood crept from its face, and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would keep the glamour of boyhood.
<p/>And when winter came upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer. Not one blossom of his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) loveliness would ever fade.
<p/>Not one pulse of his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) life would ever weaken. Like the gods of the Greeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would be strong, and fleet, and joyous.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture, smiling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) did so, and passed into his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) bedroom, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) valet was already waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>).
<p/>What did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas? He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would be safe. That was everything. An hour later he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) was at the opera, and Lord Henry was leaning over his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chair.
<p/>CHAPTER 9 As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was sitting at breakfast next morning, Basil Hallward was shown into the room. '' I am so glad I have found you, Dorian,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said gravely.
<p/>'' I called last night, and they told me you were at the opera. Of course, I knew that was impossible.
<p/>But I wish you had left word where you had really gone to. I passed a dreadful evening, half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another.
<p/>I read of it quite by chance in a late edition of The Globe that I picked up at the club.
<p/>I think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first. I came here at once and was miserable at not finding you.
<p/>I can't tell you how heart-broken I am about the whole thing. I know what you must suffer. But where were you?
<p/>Did you go down and see the girl's mother? For a moment I thought of following you there. They gave the address in the paper.
<p/>Somewhere in the Euston Road, isn't it? But I was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that I could not lighten.
<p/>Poor woman! What a state she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must be in! And her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) only child, too! What did she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) say about it all?''
<p/>'' My dear Basil, how do I know? '' murmured Dorian Gray, sipping some pale-yellow wine from a delicate, gold-beaded bubble of Venetian glass and looking dreadfully bored.
<p/>'' I was at the opera. You should have come on there. I met Lady Gwendolen, Harry's sister, for the first time.
<p/>We were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) box. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>) is perfectly charming; and Patti sang divinely. Don't talk about horrid subjects. If one doesn't talk about a thing, it has never happened.
<p/>It is simply expression, as Harry says, that gives reality to things. I may mention that she (<font color='blue'><b>Patti</b></font>) was not the woman's only child.
<p/>There is a son, a charming fellow, I believe. But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is not on the stage. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is a sailor, or something.
<p/>And now, tell me about yourself and what you are painting.'' '' You went to the opera?'' said Hallward, speaking very slowly and with a strained touch of pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) voice.
<p/>You can talk to me of other women being charming, and of Patti singing divinely, before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in?
<p/>'' You went to the opera while Sibyl Vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging? Why, man, there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Basil! I won't hear it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian, leaping to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) feet. '' You must not tell me about things.
<p/>What is done is done. What is past is past.'' <div class="bookquote">``You call yesterday the past?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What has the actual lapse of time got to do with it?
<p/>It is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion. A man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can invent a pleasure.
<p/>I don't want to be at the mercy of my emotions. I want to use them, to enjoy them, and to dominate them.''
<p/>You look exactly the same wonderful boy who, day after day, used to come down to my studio to sit for his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) picture.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Dorian, this is horrible! Something has changed you completely. But you were simple, natural, and affectionate then. You were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world.
<p/>Now, I don't know what has come over you. You talk as if you had no heart, no pity in you.
<p/>The lad flushed up and, going to the window, looked out for a few moments on the green, flickering, sun-lashed garden.
<p/>It is all Harry's influence. I see that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I owe a great deal to Harry, Basil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``more than I owe to you.
<p/>You only taught me to be vain.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Well, I am punished for that, Dorian--or shall be some day.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know what you mean, Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) exclaimed, turning round.
<p/>'' I don't know what you want. What do you want?'' <div class="bookquote">``I want the Dorian Gray I used to paint,''  (<font color='red'><b>the artist</b></font>)</div>said the artist sadly.
<p/>'' Basil,'' said the lad, going over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) shoulder, <div class="bookquote">``you have come too late.
<p/>Yesterday, when I heard that Sibyl Vane had killed herself--''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Killed herself! Good heavens! is there no doubt about that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried Hallward, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) with an expression of horror.
<p/>'' My dear Basil! Surely you don't think it was a vulgar accident? Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) killed herself. '' The elder man buried his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' How fearful,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered, and a shudder ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' No,'' said Dorian Gray, <div class="bookquote">``there is nothing fearful about it.
<p/>It is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age. As a rule, people who act lead the most commonplace lives.
<p/>They are good husbands, or faithful wives, or something tedious. You know what I mean--middle-class virtue and all that kind of thing.
<p/>How different Sibyl was! She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) lived her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) finest tragedy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was always a heroine. The last night she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) played--the night you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)--she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) acted badly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had known the reality of love.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) knew its unreality, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) died, as Juliet might have died. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) passed again into the sphere of art. There is something of the martyr about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom, all its wasted beauty. But, as I was saying, you must not think I have not suffered.
<p/>If you had come in yesterday at a particular moment--about half-past five, perhaps, or a quarter to six--you would have found me in tears.
<p/>Even Harry, who was here, who brought me the news, in fact, had no idea what I was going through. I suffered immensely.
<p/>Then it passed away. I cannot repeat an emotion. No one can, except sentimentalists. And you are awfully unjust, Basil. You come down here to console me.
<p/>You remind me of a story Harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) life in trying to get some grievance redressed, or some unjust law altered--I forget exactly what it was.
<p/>That is charming of you. You find me consoled, and you are furious. How like a sympathetic person! Finally he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) succeeded, and nothing could exceed his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) disappointment.
<p/>And besides, my dear old Basil, if you really want to console me, teach me rather to forget what has happened, or to see it from a proper artistic point of view.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had absolutely nothing to do, almost died of ennui , and became a confirmed misanthrope. Was it not Gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts ?
<p/>Well, I am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at Marlow together, the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life.
<p/>I remember picking up a little vellum-covered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase. I love beautiful things that one can touch and handle.
<p/>Old brocades, green bronzes, lacquer-work, carved ivories, exquisite surroundings, luxury, pomp--there is much to be got from all these. But the artistic temperament that they create, or at any rate reveal, is still more to me.
<p/>To become the spectator of one's own life, as Harry says, is to escape the suffering of life. I know you are surprised at my talking to you like this.
<p/>You have not realized how I have developed. I was a schoolboy when you knew me. I am a man now.
<p/>I have new passions, new thoughts, new ideas. I am different, but you must not like me less. I am changed, but you must always be my friend.
<p/>Of course, I am very fond of Harry. But I know that you are better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is. You are not stronger--you are too much afraid of life--but you are better.
<p/>And how happy we used to be together! Don't leave me, Basil, and don't quarrel with me. I am what I am.
<p/>There is nothing more to be said. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>The painter felt strangely moved. The lad was infinitely dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) personality had been the great turning point in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) art.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could not bear the idea of reproaching him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) any more. After all, his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away.
<p/>Well, Dorian,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said at length, with a sad smile, <div class="bookquote">``I won't speak to you again about this horrible thing, after to-day.
<p/>There was so much in him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that was good, so much in him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that was noble. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I only trust your name won't be mentioned in connection with it.
<p/>The inquest is to take place this afternoon. Have they summoned you?'' Dorian shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head, and a look of annoyance passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) face at the mention of the word <div class="bookquote">``inquest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>There was something so crude and vulgar about everything of the kind. '' They don't know my name,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' But surely she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did?'' <div class="bookquote">``Only my Christian name, and that I am quite sure she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) never mentioned to any one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who I was, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) invariably told them my name was Prince Charming.
<p/>I should like to have something more of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>It was pretty of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>). You must do me a drawing of Sibyl, Basil. <div class="bookquote">``I will try and do something, Dorian, if it would please you.
<p/>But you must come and sit to me yourself again. I can't get on without you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can never sit to you again, Basil.
<p/>It is impossible! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) exclaimed, starting back. The painter stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>). '' My dear boy, what nonsense! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' Do you mean to say you don't like what I did of you? Where is it? Why have you pulled the screen in front of it?
<p/>Let me look at it. It is the best thing I have ever done. Do take the screen away, Dorian. It is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that.
<p/>I felt the room looked different as I came in.'' '' My servant has nothing to do with it, Basil. You don't imagine I let him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) arrange my room for me?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) settles my flowers for me sometimes--that is all. No; I did it myself. The light was too strong on the portrait.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Too strong! Surely not, my dear fellow? It is an admirable place for it. Let me see it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>And Hallward walked towards the corner of the room.
<p/>A cry of terror broke from Dorian Gray's lips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) rushed between the painter and the screen. '' Basil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) said, looking very pale, <div class="bookquote">``you must not look at it.
<p/>I don't wish you to.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not look at my own work! You are not serious. Why shouldn't I look at it?
<p/>If you try to look at it, Basil, on my word of honour I will never speak to you again as long as I live.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Hallward, laughing. '' I am quite serious. I don't offer any explanation, and you are not to ask for any.
<p/>But, remember, if you touch this screen, everything is over between us. '' Hallward was thunderstruck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) looked at Dorian Gray in absolute amazement.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) like this before. The lad was actually pallid with rage. His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) hands were clenched, and the pupils of his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) eyes were like disks of blue fire.
<p/>Of course I won't look at it if you don't want me to,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) said, rather coldly, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) heel and going over towards the window.
<p/>But, really, it seems rather absurd that I shouldn't see my own work, especially as I am going to exhibit it in Paris in the autumn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was trembling all over. <div class="bookquote">``Dorian!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But what is the matter? '' I shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that,
<p/>so I must see it some day, and why not to-day?'' '' To exhibit it! You want to exhibit it?'' exclaimed Dorian Gray, a strange sense of terror creeping over him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>Was the world going to be shown his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) secret? Were people to gape at the mystery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) life? That was impossible.
<p/>Georges Petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the Rue de Seze, which will open the first week in October.
<p/>Something--he (<font color='blue'><b>Petit</b></font>) did not know what--had to be done at once. '' Yes; I don't suppose you will object to that. The portrait will only be away a month.
<p/>I should think you could easily spare it for that time. In fact, you are sure to be out of town.
<p/>And if you keep it always behind a screen, you can't care much about it. '' Dorian Gray passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) forehead.
<p/>There were beads of perspiration there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was on the brink of a horrible danger. '' You told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' Why have you changed your mind? You people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have.
<p/>You can't have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition.
<p/>The only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless. You told Harry exactly the same thing. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stopped suddenly, and a gleam of light came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) remembered that Lord Henry had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) once, half seriously and half in jest, <div class="bookquote">``If you want to have a strange quarter of an hour, get Basil to tell you why he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) won't exhibit your picture.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) told me why he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) wouldn't, and it was a revelation to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Yes, perhaps Basil, too, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) secret.
<p/>Basil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) said, coming over quite close and looking him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) straight in the face, <div class="bookquote">``we have each of us a secret.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) would ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) and try. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Let me know yours, and I shall tell you mine. What was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture?
<p/>'' The painter shuddered in spite of himself. '' Dorian, if I told you, you might like me less than you do, and you would certainly laugh at me.
<p/>I could not bear your doing either of those two things. If you wish me never to look at your picture again, I am content.
<p/>I have always you to look at. If you wish the best work I have ever done to be hidden from the world, I am satisfied.
<p/>Your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation. '' <div class="bookquote">``No, Basil, you must tell me,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>insisted Dorian Gray.
<p/>'' I think I have a right to know. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) feeling of terror had passed away, and curiosity had taken its place.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was determined to find out Basil Hallward's mystery. '' Let us sit down, Dorian,'' said the painter, looking troubled. <div class="bookquote">``Let us sit down.
<p/>Have you noticed in the picture something curious?--something that probably at first did not strike you, but that revealed itself to you suddenly?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Basil!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lad</b></font>)</div>cried the lad, clutching the arms of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) chair with trembling hands and gazing at him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) with wild startled eyes.
<p/>And just answer me one question. '' I see you did. Don't speak. Wait till you hear what I have to say.
<p/>Dorian, from the moment I met you, your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me. I was dominated, soul, brain, and power, by you.
<p/>You became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream. I worshipped you.
<p/>I grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke. I wanted to have you all to myself. I was only happy when I was with you.
<p/>When you were away from me, you were still present in my art.... Of course, I never let you know anything about this.
<p/>I only knew that I had seen perfection face to face, and that the world had become wonderful to my eyes--too wonderful, perhaps, for in such mad worships there is peril, the peril of losing them, no less than the peril of keeping them....
<p/>It would have been impossible. You would not have understood it. I hardly understood it myself. Weeks and weeks went on, and I grew more and more absorbed in you.
<p/>Then came a new development. I had drawn you as Paris in dainty armour, and as Adonis with huntsman's cloak and polished boar-spear.
<p/>You had leaned over the still pool of some Greek woodland and seen in the water's silent silver the marvel of your own face.
<p/>Crowned with heavy lotus-blossoms you had sat on the prow of Adrian's barge, gazing across the green turbid Nile. And it had all been what art should be--unconscious, ideal, and remote.
<p/>One day, a fatal day I sometimes think, I determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are, not in the costume of dead ages, but in your own dress and in your own time.
<p/>Whether it was the realism of the method, or the mere wonder of your own personality, thus directly presented to me without mist or veil, I cannot tell.
<p/>But I know that as I worked at it, every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret.
<p/>I grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry. I felt, Dorian, that I had told too much, that I had put too much of myself into it.
<p/>Then it was that I resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited. You were a little annoyed; but then you did not realize all that it meant to me.
<p/>Harry, to whom I talked about it, laughed at me. But I did not mind that. When the picture was finished, and I sat alone with it, I felt that I was right....
<p/>Well, after a few days the thing left my studio, and as soon as I had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence, it seemed to me that I had been foolish in imagining that I had seen anything in it, more than that you were extremely good-looking and that I could paint.
<p/>Even now I cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates.
<p/>Art is always more abstract than we fancy. Form and colour tell us of form and colour--that is all. It often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>).
<p/>And so when I got this offer from Paris, I determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition.
<p/>It never occurred to me that you would refuse. I see now that you were right. The picture cannot be shown.
<p/>You must not be angry with me, Dorian, for what I have told you. As I said to Harry, once, you are made to be worshipped.
<p/>'' Dorian Gray drew a long breath. The colour came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cheeks, and a smile played about his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lips.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), and wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend.
<p/>The peril was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was safe for the time. Lord Henry had the charm of being very dangerous. But that was all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of. Would there ever be some one who would fill him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with a strange idolatry?
<p/>Was that one of the things that life had in store? '' It is extraordinary to me, Dorian,'' said Hallward, <div class="bookquote">``that you should have seen this in the portrait.
<p/>Did you really see it?''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I saw something in it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``something that seemed to me very curious.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Well, you don't mind my looking at the thing now?
<p/>'' Dorian shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head. '' You must not ask me that, Basil. I could not possibly let you stand in front of that picture.''
<p/>'' You will some day, surely?'' <div class="bookquote">``Never.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, perhaps you are right. And now good-bye, Dorian. You have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art.
<p/>Whatever I have done that is good, I owe to you. Ah! you don't know what it cost me to tell you all that I have told you.''
<p/>'' My dear Basil,'' said Dorian, <div class="bookquote">``what have you told me? Simply that you felt that you admired me too much.
<p/>That is not even a compliment.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was not intended as a compliment. It was a confession. Now that I have made it, something seems to have gone out of me.
<p/>Perhaps one should never put one's worship into words.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It was a very disappointing confession. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why, what did you expect, Dorian?
<p/>You didn't see anything else in the picture, did you? There was nothing else to see?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No; there was nothing else to see.
<p/>Why do you ask? But you mustn't talk about worship. It is foolish. You and I are friends, Basil, and we must always remain so.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You have got Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div>said the painter sadly. '' Oh, Harry!'' cried the lad, with a ripple of laughter. ''
<p/>Harry spends his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) days in saying what is incredible and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) evenings in doing what is improbable. Just the sort of life I would like to lead.
<p/>But still I don't think I would go to Harry if I were in trouble. I would sooner go to you, Basil.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You will sit to me again?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Impossible!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You spoil my life as an artist by refusing, Dorian. No man comes across two ideal things.
<p/>Few come across one.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't explain it to you, Basil, but I must never sit to you again. There is something fatal about a portrait.
<p/>It has a life of its own. I will come and have tea with you. That will be just as pleasant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pleasanter for you, I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>murmured Hallward regretfully. '' And now good-bye. I am sorry you won't let me look at the picture once again.
<p/>But that can't be helped. I quite understand what you feel about it. '' As he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) left the room, Dorian Gray smiled to himself.
<p/>And how strange it was that, instead of having been forced to reveal his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own secret, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had succeeded, almost by chance, in wresting a secret from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) friend!
<p/>The painter's absurd fits of jealousy, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wild devotion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) extravagant panegyrics, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) curious reticences--he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) understood them all now, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt sorry.
<p/>Poor Basil! How little he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) knew of the true reason! How much that strange confession explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)! There seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) sighed and touched the bell. The portrait must be hidden away at all costs. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) could not run such a risk of discovery again.
<p/>It had been mad of him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) to have allowed the thing to remain, even for an hour, in a room to which any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) friends had access.
<p/>CHAPTER 10 When his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) servant entered, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) steadfastly and wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had thought of peering behind the screen.
<p/>The man was quite impassive and waited for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) orders. Dorian lit a cigarette and walked over to the glass and glanced into it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) could see the reflection of Victor's face perfectly. It was like a placid mask of servility. There was nothing to be afraid of, there.
<p/>Speaking very slowly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to tell the house-keeper that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) wanted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), and then to go to the frame-maker and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) to send two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) men round at once.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) thought it best to be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) guard. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that as the man left the room his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes wandered in the direction of the screen.
<p/>After a few moments, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) black silk dress, with old-fashioned thread mittens on her (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) wrinkled hands, Mrs. Leaf bustled into the library.
<p/>Or was that merely his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own fancy? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>) for the key of the schoolroom. '' The old schoolroom, Mr. Dorian?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>) exclaimed.
<p/>'' Why, it is full of dust. I must get it arranged and put straight before you go into it. It is not fit for you to see, sir.
<p/>It is not, indeed.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't want it put straight, Leaf. I only want the key.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well, sir, you'll be covered with cobwebs if you go into it.
<p/>Why, it hasn't been opened for nearly five years--not since his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) lordship died. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) winced at the mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) grandfather.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had hateful memories of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). '' That does not matter,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered. '' I simply want to see the place--that is all.
<p/>And here is the key, sir,'' said the old lady, going over the contents of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bunch with tremulously uncertain hands.
<p/>Give me the key.'' '' '' Here is the key. I'll have it off the bunch in a moment. But you don't think of living up there, sir, and you so comfortable here?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cried petulantly. '' Thank you, Leaf. That will do. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lingered for a few moments, and was garrulous over some detail of the household.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) sighed and told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to manage things as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought best. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) left the room, wreathed in smiles. As the door closed, Dorian put the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) pocket and looked round the room.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) eye fell on a large, purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold, a splendid piece of late seventeenth-century Venetian work that his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) grandfather had found in a convent near Bologna.
<p/>Yes, that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in. It had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead.
<p/>Now it was to hide something that had a corruption of its own, worse than the corruption of death itself--something that would breed horrors and yet would never die.
<p/>What the worm was to the corpse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty and eat away its grace.
<p/>They would defile it and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shuddered, and for a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) regretted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had not told Basil the true reason why he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had wished to hide the picture away.
<p/>Basil would have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) to resist Lord Henry's influence, and the still more poisonous influences that came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) own temperament.
<p/>It was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire.
<p/>The love that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) bore him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>)--for it was really love--had nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual. It was such love as Michelangelo had known, and Montaigne, and Winckelmann, and Shakespeare himself.
<p/>Yes, Basil could have saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). But it was too late now. The past could always be annihilated. Regret, denial, or forgetfulness could do that.
<p/>There were passions in him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) that would find their terrible outlet, dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) took up from the couch the great purple-and-gold texture that covered it, and, holding it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) hands, passed behind the screen.
<p/>But the future was inevitable. Was the face on the canvas viler than before? It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) that it was unchanged, and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) loathing of it was intensified.
<p/>Gold hair, blue eyes, and rose-red lips--they all were there. It was simply the expression that had altered. That was horrible in its cruelty.
<p/>Compared to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) saw in it of censure or rebuke, how shallow Basil's reproaches about Sibyl Vane had been!--how shallow, and of what little account!
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) own soul was looking out at him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) from the canvas and calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) to judgement. A look of pain came across him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) flung the rich pall over the picture.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) did so, a knock came to the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) passed out as his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) servant entered. '' The persons are here, Monsieur.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) felt that the man must be got rid of at once. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) must not be allowed to know where the picture was being taken to.
<p/>Sitting down at the writing-table he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) scribbled a note to Lord Henry, asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) round something to read and reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that they were to meet at eight-fifteen that evening.
<p/>There was something sly about him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had thoughtful, treacherous eyes. '' Wait for an answer,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, handing it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and show the men in here.
<p/>In two or three minutes there was another knock, and Mr. Hubbard himself, the celebrated frame-maker of South Audley Street, came in with a somewhat rough-looking young assistant.
<p/>Mr. Hubbard was a florid, red-whiskered little man, whose admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artists who dealt with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>As a rule, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) never left his (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) shop. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) waited for people to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) always made an exception in favour of Dorian Gray.
<p/>There was something about Dorian that charmed everybody. It was a pleasure even to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). '' What can I do for you, Mr. Gray?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) said, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) fat freckled hands. '' I thought I would do myself the honour of coming round in person.
<p/>I have just got a beauty of a frame, sir. Picked it up at a sale. Old Florentine. Came from Fonthill, I believe.
<p/>Admirably suited for a religious subject, Mr. Gray. '' <div class="bookquote">``I am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round, Mr. Hubbard.
<p/>I shall certainly drop in and look at the frame--though I don't go in much at present for religious art--but to-day I only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me.
<p/>It is rather heavy, so I thought I would ask you to lend me a couple of your men. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>No trouble at all, Mr. Gray. I am delighted to be of any service to you. Which is the work of art, sir?''
<p/>'' This,'' replied Dorian, moving the screen back. '' Can you move it, covering and all, just as it is? I don't want it to get scratched going upstairs.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There will be no difficulty, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the frame-maker</b></font>)</div>said the genial frame-maker, beginning, with the aid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) assistant, to unhook the picture from the long brass chains by which it was suspended.
<p/>'' '' And, now, where shall we carry it to, Mr. Gray?'' <div class="bookquote">``I will show you the way, Mr. Hubbard, if you will kindly follow me.
<p/>Or perhaps you had better go in front. I am afraid it is right at the top of the house. We will go up by the front staircase, as it is wider.
<p/>The elaborate character of the frame had made the picture extremely bulky, and now and then, in spite of the obsequious protests of Mr. Hubbard, who had the true tradesman's spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful, Dorian put his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand to it so as to help them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) held the door open for them, and they passed out into the hall and began the ascent. '' Something of a load to carry, sir,'' gasped the little man when they reached the top landing.
<p/>I am afraid it is rather heavy,'' murmured Dorian as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) unlocked the door that opened into the room that was to keep for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) the curious secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) life and hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) soul from the eyes of men.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had not entered the place for more than four years--not, indeed, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had used it first as a play-room when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was a child, and then as a study when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) grew somewhat older.
<p/>It was a large, well-proportioned room, which had been specially built by the last Lord Kelso for the use of the little grandson whom, for his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) strange likeness to his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) mother, and also for other reasons, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) had always hated and desired to keep at a distance.
<p/>There was the huge Italian cassone , with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) had so often hidden himself as a boy.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>grandson</b></font>) shiny forehead. '' It appeared to Dorian to have but little changed. There the satinwood book-case filled with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) dog-eared schoolbooks.
<p/>On the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged Flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden, while a company of hawkers rode by, carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists.
<p/>How well he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) remembered it all! Every moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) lonely childhood came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) looked round. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) recalled the stainless purity of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) boyish life, and it seemed horrible to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) that it was here
<p/>the fatal portrait was to be hidden away. How little he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had thought, in those dead days, of all that was in store for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)!
<p/>But there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as this. He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had the key, and no one else could enter it.
<p/>Beneath its purple pall, the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial, sodden, and unclean. What did it matter? No one could see it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) himself would not see it. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) watch the hideous corruption of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) soul? He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) youth--that was enough.
<p/>And, besides, might not his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) nature grow finer, after all? There was no reason that the future should be so full of shame.
<p/>Some love might come across his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) life, and purify him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>), and shield him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in flesh--those curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm.
<p/>Perhaps, some day, the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth, and he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) might show to the world Basil Hallward's masterpiece.
<p/>No; that was impossible. Hour by hour, and week by week, the thing upon the canvas was growing old. It might escape the hideousness of sin, but the hideousness of age was in store for it.
<p/>The hair would lose its brightness, the mouth would gape or droop, would be foolish or gross, as the mouths of old men are.
<p/>There would be the wrinkled throat, the cold, blue-veined hands, the twisted body, that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) boyhood.
<p/>The cheeks would become hollow or flaccid. Yellow crow's feet would creep round the fading eyes and make them horrible. The picture had to be concealed.
<p/>There was no help for it. '' Bring it in, Mr. Hubbard, please,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) said, wearily, turning round. '' I am sorry I kept you so long.
<p/>I was thinking of something else. '' <div class="bookquote">``Always glad to have a rest, Mr. Gray,''  (<font color='red'><b>the frame-maker</b></font>)</div>answered the frame-maker, who was still gasping for breath.
<p/>'' Where shall we put it, sir?'' '' Oh, anywhere. Here: this will do. I don't want to have it hung up.
<p/>Just lean it against the wall. Thanks. '' <div class="bookquote">``Might one look at the work of art, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>Dorian started. '' It would not interest you, Mr. Hubbard,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) said, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) eye on the man.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) felt ready to leap upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) and fling him (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) to the ground if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hubbard</b></font>) life.
<p/>'' I shan't trouble you any more now. I am much obliged for your kindness in coming round.'' <div class="bookquote">``Not at all, not at all, Mr. Gray.
<p/>And Mr. Hubbard tramped downstairs, followed by the assistant, who glanced back at Dorian with a look of shy wonder in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) rough uncomely face.
<p/>Ever ready to do anything for you, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had never seen any one so marvellous. When the sound of their footsteps had died away, Dorian locked the door and put the key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt safe now. No one would ever look upon the horrible thing. No eye but his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) would ever see his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shame.
<p/>On reaching the library, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) found that it was just after five o'clock and that the tea had been already brought up.
<p/>On a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre, a present from Lady Radley, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) guardian's wife, a pretty professional invalid who had spent the preceding winter in Cairo, was lying a note from Lord Henry, and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper, the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled.
<p/>A copy of the third edition of The St. James's Gazette had been placed on the tea-tray. It was evident that Victor had returned.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) wondered if he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) would be sure to miss the picture--had no doubt missed it already, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had been laying the tea-things. The screen had not been set back, and a blank space was visible on the wall.
<p/>Perhaps some night he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) might find him (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room. It was a horrible thing to have a spy in one's house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>spy</b></font>) had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter, or overheard a conversation, or picked up a card with an address, or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace.
<p/>It was simply to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) round the evening paper, and a book that might interest him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) would be at the club at eight-fifteen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) sighed, and having poured himself out some tea, opened Lord Henry's note. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opened The St. James's languidly, and looked through it.
<p/>AN ACTRESS.--An inquest was held this morning at the Bell Tavern, Hoxton Road, by Mr. Danby, the District Coroner, on the body of Sibyl Vane, a young actress recently engaged at the Royal Theatre, Holborn.
<p/>A red pencil-mark on the fifth page caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) eye. It drew attention to the following paragraph: INQUEST ON A verdict of death by misadventure was returned.
<p/>Considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased, who was greatly affected during the giving of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own evidence, and that of Dr. Birrell, who had made the post-mortem examination of the deceased.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) frowned, and tearing the paper in two, went across the room and flung the pieces away. How ugly it all was!
<p/>And how horribly real ugliness made things! He (<font color='blue'><b>Coroner</b></font>) felt a little annoyed with Lord Henry for having sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the report.
<p/>And it was certainly stupid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to have marked it with red pencil. Victor might have read it. The man knew more than enough English for that.
<p/>Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Victor</b></font>) had read it and had begun to suspect something. And, yet, what did it matter? What had Dorian Gray to do with Sibyl Vane's death?
<p/>There was nothing to fear. Dorian Gray had not killed her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eye fell on the yellow book that Lord Henry had sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) went towards the little, pearl-coloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) like the work of some strange Egyptian bees that wrought in silver, and taking up the volume, flung himself into an arm-chair and began to turn over the leaves.
<p/>What was it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wondered. After a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) became absorbed. It was the strangest book that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had ever read.
<p/>It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that in exquisite raiment, and to the delicate sound of flutes, the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>Things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Things of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had never dreamed were gradually revealed.
<p/>It was a novel without a plot and with only one character, being, indeed, simply a psychological study of a certain young Parisian who spent his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own, and to sum up, as it were, in himself the various moods through which the world-spirit had ever passed, loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue, as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin.
<p/>The style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style, vivid and obscure at once, full of argot and of archaisms, of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases, that characterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the French school of Symbolistes .
<p/>There were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour. The life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy.
<p/>One hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some mediaeval saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner.
<p/>It was a poisonous book. The heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain.
<p/>The mere cadence of the sentences, the subtle monotony of their music, so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated, produced in the mind of the lad, as he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) passed from chapter to chapter, a form of reverie, a malady of dreaming, that made him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows.
<p/>Cloudless, and pierced by one solitary star, a copper-green sky gleamed through the windows. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) read on by its wan light till he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) could read no more.
<p/>Then, after his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) valet had reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) several times of the lateness of the hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) got up, and going into the next room, placed the book on the little Florentine table that always stood at his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) bedside and began to dress for dinner.
<p/>It was almost nine o'clock before he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) reached the club, where he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) found Lord Henry sitting alone, in the morning-room, looking very much bored.
<p/>'' I am so sorry, Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``but really it is entirely your fault. That book you sent me so fascinated me that I forgot how the time was going.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, I thought you would like it,'' replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) host, rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) chair. '' I didn't say I liked it, Harry.
<p/>I said it fascinated me. There is a great difference.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, you have discovered that?''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>murmured Lord Henry. And they passed into the dining-room.
<p/>CHAPTER 11 For years, Dorian Gray could not free himself from the influence of this book. Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) never sought to free himself from it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) procured from Paris no less than nine large-paper copies of the first edition, and had them bound in different colours, so that they might suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) seemed, at times, to have almost entirely lost control.
<p/>The hero, the wonderful young Parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended, became to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) a kind of prefiguring type of himself.
<p/>And, indeed, the whole book seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) to contain the story of his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) own life, written before he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had lived it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) never knew--never, indeed, had any cause to know--that somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors, and polished metal surfaces, and still water which came upon the young Parisian so early in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) life, and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once, apparently, been so remarkable.
<p/>It was with an almost cruel joy--and perhaps in nearly every joy, as certainly in every pleasure, cruelty has its place--that he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) used to read the latter part of the book, with its really tragic, if somewhat overemphasized, account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others, and the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) had most dearly valued.
<p/>In one point he (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was more fortunate than the novel's fantastic hero. For the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated Basil Hallward, and many others besides him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), seemed never to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>).
<p/>Even those who had heard the most evil things against him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>)--and from time to time strange rumours about his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) mode of life crept through London and became the chatter of the clubs--could not believe anything to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) dishonour when they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world. Men who talked grossly became silent when Dorian Gray entered the room.
<p/>There was something in the purity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) face that rebuked them. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished.
<p/>They wondered how one so charming and graceful as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual.
<p/>Often, on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) friends, or thought that they were so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) himself would creep upstairs to the locked room, open the door with the key that never left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) now, and stand, with a mirror, in front of the portrait that Basil Hallward had painted of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas, and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) from the polished glass.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) grew more and more enamoured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own soul.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would examine with minute care, and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight, the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth, wondering sometimes which were the more horrible, the signs of sin or the signs of age.
<p/>The very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) sense of pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would place his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture, and smile.
<p/>There were moments, indeed, at night, when, lying sleepless in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own delicately scented chamber, or in the sordid room of the little ill-famed tavern near the docks which, under an assumed name and in disguise, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) habit to frequent, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would think of the ruin he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had brought upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish.
<p/>That curiosity about life which Lord Henry had first stirred in him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), as they sat together in the garden of their friend, seemed to increase with gratification.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs. But moments such as these were rare. The more he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) desired to know.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fed them. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not really reckless, at any rate in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) relations to society.
<p/>Once or twice every month during the winter, and on each Wednesday evening while the season lasted, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would throw open to the world his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) guests with the wonders of their art.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) little dinners, in the settling of which Lord Henry always assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited, as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table, with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers, and embroidered cloths, and antique plate of gold and silver.
<p/>Indeed, there were many, especially among the very young men, who saw, or fancied that they saw, in Dorian Gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in Eton or Oxford days, a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world.
<p/>To them he (<font color='blue'><b>citizen</b></font>) seemed to be of the company of those whom Dante describes as having sought to <div class="bookquote">``make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty.
<p/>And, certainly, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) life itself was the first, the greatest, of the arts, and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation.
<p/>Fashion, by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal, and dandyism, which, in its own way, is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty, had, of course, their fascination for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) mode of dressing, and the particular styles that from time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) affected, had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the Mayfair balls and Pall Mall club windows, who copied him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) in everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) did, and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) graceful, though to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) only half-serious, fopperies.
<p/>For, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) coming of age, and found, indeed, a subtle pleasure in the thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) might really become to the London of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) own day what to imperial Neronian Rome the author of the Satyricon once had been, yet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) inmost heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum , to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel, or the knotting of a necktie, or the conduct of a cane.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dante</b></font>) sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles, and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization.
<p/>The worship of the senses has often, and with much justice, been decried, men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves, and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence.
<p/>But it appeared to Dorian Gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood, and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain, instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality, of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dante</b></font>)</div>Like Gautier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was one for whom <div class="bookquote">``the visible world existed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) looked back upon man moving through history, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was haunted by a feeling of loss.
<p/>There had been mad wilful rejections, monstrous forms of self-torture and self-denial, whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which, in their ignorance, they had sought to escape; Nature, in her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wonderful irony, driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) companions.
<p/>Yes: there was to be, as Lord Henry had prophesied, a new Hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having, in our own day, its curious revival.
<p/>It was to have its service of the intellect, certainly, yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience.
<p/>Its aim, indeed, was to be experience itself, and not the fruits of experience, sweet or bitter as they might be.
<p/>So much had been surrendered! and to such little purpose! Of the asceticism that deadens the senses, as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them, it was to know nothing.
<p/>But it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment.
<p/>There are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn, either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death, or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy, when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself, and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques, and that lends to Gothic art its enduring vitality, this art being, one might fancy, especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie.
<p/>Gradually white fingers creep through the curtains, and they appear to tremble. In black fantastic shapes, dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there.
<p/>Outside, there is the stirring of birds among the leaves, or the sound of men going forth to their work, or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house, as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her (<font color='blue'><b>sleepers</b></font>) purple cave.
<p/>Veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted, and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them, and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern.
<p/>The flameless tapers stand where we had left them, and beside them lies the half-cut book that we had been studying, or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball, or the letter that we had been afraid to read, or that we had read too often.
<p/>The wan mirrors get back their mimic life. Nothing seems to us changed. Out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known.
<p/>We have to resume it where we had left off, and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits, or a wild longing, it may be, that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure, a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours, and be changed, or have other secrets, a world in which the past would have little or no place, or survive, at any rate, in no conscious form of obligation or regret, the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain.
<p/>It was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to Dorian Gray to be the true object, or amongst the true objects, of life; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful, and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) would often adopt certain modes of thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) knew to be really alien to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) nature, abandon himself to their subtle influences, and then, having, as it were, caught their colour and satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) intellectual curiosity, leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament, and that, indeed, according to certain modern psychologists, is often a condition of it.
<p/>It was rumoured of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was about to join the Roman Catholic communion, and certainly the Roman ritual had always a great attraction for him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>).
<p/>The daily sacrifice, more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world, stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) stiff flowered dalmatic, slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle, or raising aloft the jewelled, lantern-shaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times, one would fain think, is indeed the '' panis caelestis ,'' the bread of angels, or, robed in the garments of the Passion of Christ, breaking the Host into the chalice and smiting his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) breast for his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) sins.
<p/>The fuming censers that the grave boys, in their lace and scarlet, tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) passed out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) never fell into the error of arresting his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system, or of mistaking, for a house in which to live, an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night, or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail.
<p/>Mysticism, with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us, and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it, moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) for a season; and for a season he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the Darwinismus movement in Germany, and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain, or some white nerve in the body, delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions, morbid or healthy, normal or diseased.
<p/>Yet, as has been said of him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) before, no theory of life seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) to be of any importance compared with life itself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) knew that the senses, no less than the soul, have their spiritual mysteries to reveal.
<p/>And so he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture, distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the East.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life, and set himself to discover their true relations, wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical, and in ambergris that stirred one's passions, and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances, and in musk that troubled the brain, and in champak that stained the imagination; and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes, and to estimate the several influences of sweet-smelling roots and scented, pollen-laden flowers; of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods; of spikenard, that sickens; of hovenia, that makes men mad; and of aloes, that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul.
<p/>At another time he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) devoted himself entirely to music, and in a long latticed room, with a vermilion-and-gold ceiling and walls of olive-green lacquer, he (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) used to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers, or grave, yellow-shawled Tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes, while grinning Negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and, crouching upon scarlet mats, slim turbaned Indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmed--or feigned to charm--great hooded snakes and horrible horned adders.
<p/>The harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>men</b></font>) at times when Schubert's grace, and Chopin's beautiful sorrows, and the mighty harmonies of Beethoven himself, fell unheeded on his (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) ear.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found, either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with Western civilizations, and loved to touch and try them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Beethoven</b></font>) had the mysterious juruparis of the Rio Negro Indians, that women are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging, and the earthen jars of the Peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds, and flutes of human bones such as Alfonso de Ovalle heard in Chile, and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near Cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alfonso</b></font>) had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken; the long clarin of the Mexicans, into which the performer does not blow, but through which he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) inhales the air; the harsh ture of the Amazon tribes, that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees, and can be heard, it is said, at a distance of three leagues; the teponaztli , that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants; the yotl -bells of the Aztecs, that are hung in clusters like grapes; and a huge cylindrical drum, covered with the skins of great serpents, like the one that Bernal Diaz saw when he (<font color='blue'><b>Diaz</b></font>) went with Cortes into the Mexican temple, and of whose doleful sound he (<font color='blue'><b>Diaz</b></font>) has left us so vivid a description.
<p/>The fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) felt a curious delight in the thought that art, like Nature, has her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) monsters, things of bestial shape and with hideous voices.
<p/>Yet, after some time, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wearied of them, and would sit in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) box at the opera, either alone or with Lord Henry, listening in rapt pleasure to <div class="bookquote">``Tannhauser''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own soul.
<p/>On one occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) took up the study of jewels, and appeared at a costume ball as Anne de Joyeuse, Admiral of France, in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had collected, such as the olive-green chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight, the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver, the pistachio-coloured peridot, rose-pink and wine-yellow topazes, carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous, four-rayed stars, flame-red cinnamon-stones, orange and violet spinels, and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) loved the red gold of the sunstone, and the moonstone's pearly whiteness, and the broken rainbow of the milky opal.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) procured from Amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour, and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs.
<p/>This taste enthralled him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) for years, and, indeed, may be said never to have left him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) discovered wonderful stories, also, about jewels.
<p/>In Alphonso's Clericalis Disciplina a serpent was mentioned with eyes of real jacinth, and in the romantic history of Alexander, the Conqueror of Emathia was said to have found in the vale of Jordan snakes ``with collars of real emeralds growing on their backs.
<p/>There was a gem in the brain of the dragon, Philostratus told us, and <div class="bookquote">``by the exhibition of golden letters and a scarlet robe''  (<font color='red'><b>Philostratus</b></font>)</div>the monster could be thrown into a magical sleep and slain.
<p/>According to the great alchemist, Pierre de Boniface, the diamond rendered a man invisible, and the agate of India made him (<font color='blue'><b>Pierre</b></font>) eloquent.
<p/>'' The cornelian appeased anger, and the hyacinth provoked sleep, and the amethyst drove away the fumes of wine. The garnet cast out demons, and the hydropicus deprived the moon of her (<font color='blue'><b>Boniface</b></font>) colour.
<p/>The selenite waxed and waned with the moon, and the meloceus, that discovers thieves, could be affected only by the blood of kids.
<p/>Leonardus Camillus had seen a white stone taken from the brain of a newly killed toad, that was a certain antidote against poison.
<p/>In the nests of Arabian birds was the aspilates, that, according to Democritus, kept the wearer from any danger by fire.
<p/>The King of Ceilan rode through his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) city with a large ruby in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand, as the ceremony of his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) coronation.
<p/>The gates of the palace of John the Priest were <div class="bookquote">``made of sardius, with the horn of the horned snake inwrought, so that no man might bring poison within.
<p/>The bezoar, that was found in the heart of the Arabian deer, was a charm that could cure the plague. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Priest</b></font>)</div><p/>Over the gable were <div class="bookquote">``two golden apples, in which were two carbuncles,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>so that the gold might shine by day and the carbuncles by night.
<p/>In Lodge's strange romance 'A Margarite of America', it was stated that in the chamber of the queen one could behold <div class="bookquote">``all the chaste ladies of the world, inchased out of silver, looking through fair mirrours of chrysolites, carbuncles, sapphires, and greene emeraults.
<p/>A sea-monster had been enamoured of the pearl that the diver brought to King Perozes, and had slain the thief, and mourned for seven moons over its loss.
<p/>When the Huns lured the king into the great pit, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) flung it away--Procopius tells the story--nor was it ever found again, though the Emperor Anastasius offered five hundred-weight of gold pieces for it.
<p/>The King of Malabar had shown to a certain Venetian a rosary of three hundred and four pearls, one for every god that he (<font color='blue'><b>god</b></font>) worshipped.
<p/>When the Duke de Valentinois, son of Alexander VI, visited Louis XII of France, his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) horse was loaded with gold leaves, according to Brantome, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) cap had double rows of rubies that threw out a great light.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the queen</b></font>)</div>Marco Polo had seen the inhabitants of Zipangu place rose-coloured pearls in the mouths of the dead. Charles of England had ridden in stirrups hung with four hundred and twenty-one diamonds.
<p/>Hall described Henry VIII, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) way to the Tower previous to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) coronation, as wearing <div class="bookquote">``a jacket of raised gold, the placard embroidered with diamonds and other rich stones, and a great bauderike about his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) neck of large balasses.
<p/>Richard II had a coat, valued at thirty thousand marks, which was covered with balas rubies. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>The favourites of James I wore ear-rings of emeralds set in gold filigrane.
<p/>Edward II gave to Piers Gaveston a suit of red-gold armour studded with jacinths, a collar of gold roses set with turquoise-stones, and a skull-cap parseme with pearls.
<p/>Henry II wore jewelled gloves reaching to the elbow, and had a hawk-glove sewn with twelve rubies and fifty-two great orients.
<p/>The ducal hat of Charles the Rash, the last Duke of Burgundy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) race, was hung with pear-shaped pearls and studded with sapphires.
<p/>How exquisite life had once been! How gorgeous in its pomp and decoration! Even to read of the luxury of the dead was wonderful.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of Europe.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) investigated the subject--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) took up--he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things.
<p/>Summer followed summer, and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times, and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was unchanged.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), at any rate, had escaped that. No winter marred his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) face or stained his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) flowerlike bloom. How different it was with material things!
<p/>Where was the great crocus-coloured robe, on which the gods fought against the giants, that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of Athena?
<p/>Where the huge velarium that Nero had stretched across the Colosseum at Rome, that Titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky, and Apollo driving a chariot drawn by white, gilt-reined steeds?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nero</b></font>) longed to see the curious table-napkins wrought for the Priest of the Sun, on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast; the mortuary cloth of King Chilperic, with its three hundred golden bees; the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the Bishop of Pontus and were figured with <div class="bookquote">``lions, panthers, bears, dogs, forests, rocks, hunters--all, in fact, that a painter can copy from nature'' (<font color='red'><b>the Bishop</b></font>)</div>; and the coat that Charles of Orleans once wore, on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning '' Madame, je suis tout joyeux ,'' the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread, and each note, of square shape in those days, formed with four pearls.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) read of the room that was prepared at the palace at Rheims for the use of Queen Joan of Burgundy and was decorated with <div class="bookquote">``thirteen hundred and twenty-one parrots, made in broidery, and blazoned with the king's arms, and five hundred and sixty-one butterflies, whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen, the whole worked in gold.
<p/>Where had they passed to? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Queen Joan</b></font>)</div>Catherine de Medicis had a mourning-bed made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns.
<p/>Its curtains were of damask, with leafy wreaths and garlands, figured upon a gold and silver ground, and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls, and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queen's devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver.
<p/>The state bed of Sobieski, King of Poland, was made of Smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the Koran.
<p/>Louis XIV had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his (<font color='blue'><b>Louis</b></font>) apartment. Its supports were of silver gilt, beautifully chased, and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions.
<p/>It had been taken from the Turkish camp before Vienna, and the standard of Mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy.
<p/>And so, for a whole year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mohammed</b></font>) sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mohammed</b></font>) could find of textile and embroidered work, getting the dainty Delhi muslins, finely wrought with gold-thread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles' wings;
<p/>the Dacca gauzes, that from their transparency are known in the East as <div class="bookquote">``woven air,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``running water,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``evening dew'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; strange figured cloths from Java; elaborate yellow Chinese hangings; books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with fleurs-de-lis , birds and images; veils of lacis worked in Hungary point; Sicilian brocades and stiff Spanish velvets; Georgian work, with its gilt coins, and Japanese Foukousas , with their green-toned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had a special passion, also, for ecclesiastical vestments, as indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had for everything connected with the service of the Church.
<p/>In the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) house, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the Bride of Christ, who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bride</b></font>) seeks for and wounded by self-inflicted pain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and gold-thread damask, figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in six-petalled formal blossoms, beyond which on either side was the pine-apple device wrought in seed-pearls.
<p/>The orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the Virgin, and the coronation of the Virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood.
<p/>Another cope was of green velvet, embroidered with heart-shaped groups of acanthus-leaves, from which spread long-stemmed white blossoms, the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals.
<p/>The orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk, and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs, among whom was St. Sebastian.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sebastian</b></font>) had chasubles, also, of amber-coloured silk, and blue silk and gold brocade, and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold, figured with representations of the Passion and Crucifixion of Christ, and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems; dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask, decorated with tulips and dolphins and fleurs-de-lis ; altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen; and many corporals, chalice-veils, and sudaria.
<p/>This was Italian work of the fifteenth century. The morse bore a seraph's head in gold-thread raised work. In the mystic offices to which such things were put, there was something that quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) imagination.
<p/>modes by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) could escape, for a season, from the fear that seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) at times to be almost too great to be borne.
<p/>Upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had spent so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) boyhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had hung with his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) the real degradation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) life, and in front of it had draped the purple-and-gold pall as a curtain.
<p/>For weeks he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would not go there, would forget the hideous painted thing, and get back his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) light heart, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) wonderful joyousness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) passionate absorption in mere existence.
<p/>Then, suddenly, some night he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would creep out of the house, go down to dreadful places near Blue Gate Fields, and stay there, day after day, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) was driven away.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) return he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) would sit in front of the picture, sometimes loathing it and himself, but filled, at other times, with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin, and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) own.
<p/>After a few years he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) could not endure to be long out of England, and gave up the villa that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) had shared at Trouville with Lord Henry, as well as the little white walled-in house at Algiers where they had more than once spent the winter.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life, and was also afraid that during his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) absence some one might gain access to the room, in spite of the elaborate bars that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had caused to be placed upon the door.
<p/>For these treasures, and everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) collected in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lovely house, were to be to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) means of forgetfulness, He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing.
<p/>It was true that the portrait still preserved, under all the foulness and ugliness of the face, its marked likeness to himself; but what could they learn from that?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had not painted it. What was it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
<p/>how vile and full of shame it looked? Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) told them, would they believe it? Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was afraid.
<p/>Sometimes when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was down at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) great house in Nottinghamshire, entertaining the fashionable young men of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own rank who were his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chief companions, and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mode of life, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would suddenly leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there.
<p/>What if it should be stolen? The mere thought made him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cold with horror. Surely the world would know his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) secret then.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was very nearly blackballed at a West End club of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) birth and social position fully entitled him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to become a member, and it was said that on one occasion, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was brought by a friend into the smoking-room of the Churchill, the Duke of Berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out.
<p/>Perhaps the world already suspected it. For, while he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) fascinated many, there were not a few who distrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Curious stories became current about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) after he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had passed his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) twenty-fifth year.
<p/>It was rumoured that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant parts of Whitechapel, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) consorted with thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) extraordinary absences became notorious, and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) used to reappear again in society, men would whisper to each other in corners, or pass him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with a sneer, or look at him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with cold searching eyes, as though they were determined to discover his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) secret.
<p/>Of such insolences and attempted slights he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), of course, took no notice, and in the opinion of most people his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) frank debonair manner, his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) charming boyish smile, and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies, for so they termed them, that were circulated about him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>It was remarked, however, that some of those who had been most intimate with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appeared, after a time, to shun him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>).
<p/>Women who had wildly adored him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), and for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance, were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if Dorian Gray entered the room.
<p/>Yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) strange and dangerous charm. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) great wealth was a certain element of security.
<p/>Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating.
<p/>It feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals, and, in its opinion, the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef .
<p/>And, after all, it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner, or poor wine, is irreproachable in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) private life.
<p/>Even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for half-cold entrees , as Lord Henry remarked once, in a discussion on the subject, and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) view.
<p/>For the canons of good society are, or should be, the same as the canons of art. Form is absolutely essential to it.
<p/>It should have the dignity of a ceremony, as well as its unreality, and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us.
<p/>Is insincerity such a terrible thing? I think not. It is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing simple, permanent, reliable, and of one essence.
<p/>To him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations, a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion, and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picture-gallery of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) country house and look at the various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) veins.
<p/>Here was Philip Herbert, described by Francis Osborne, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) Memoires on the Reigns of Queen Elizabeth and King James, as one who was <div class="bookquote">``caressed by the Court for his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) handsome face, which kept him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) not long company.
<p/>Such, at any rate, was Dorian Gray's opinion. ''  (<font color='red'><b>King James</b></font>)</div>Was it young Herbert's life that he (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) sometimes led? Had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) own?
<p/>Was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Herbert</b></font>) so suddenly, and almost without cause, give utterance, in Basil Hallward's studio, to the mad prayer that had so changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) life?
<p/>Here, in gold-embroidered red doublet, jewelled surcoat, and gilt-edged ruff and wristbands, stood Sir Anthony Sherard, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) silver-and-black armour piled at his (<font color='blue'><b>Anthony</b></font>) feet.
<p/>What had this man's legacy been? Had the lover of Giovanna of Naples bequeathed him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) some inheritance of sin and shame?
<p/>Were his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize? Here, from the fading canvas, smiled Lady Elizabeth Devereux, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) gauze hood, pearl stomacher, and pink slashed sleeves.
<p/>A flower was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) right hand, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses. On a table by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) side lay a mandolin and an apple.
<p/>There were large green rosettes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) little pointed shoes. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) life, and the strange stories that were told about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lovers.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) temperament in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? These oval, heavy-lidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). What of George Willoughby, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) powdered hair and fantastic patches?
<p/>How evil he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) looked! The face was saturnine and swarthy, and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain. Delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings.
<p/>What of the second Lord Beckenham, the companion of the Prince Regent in his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) wildest days, and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with Mrs. Fitzherbert?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century, and the friend, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) youth, of Lord Ferrars. How proud and handsome he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) was, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) chestnut curls and insolent pose!
<p/>What passions had he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) bequeathed? The world had looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) as infamous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) had led the orgies at Carlton House.
<p/>The star of the Garter glittered upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) breast. Beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) hung the portrait of his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) wife, a pallid, thin-lipped woman in black.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blood, also, stirred within him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>). How curious it all seemed! And his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) mother with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) Lady Hamilton face and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) moist, wine-dashed lips--he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) had got from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) had got from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) beauty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) passion for the beauty of others. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Regent</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) loose Bacchante dress.
<p/>There were vine leaves in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hair. The purple spilled from the cup she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was holding. The carnations of the painting had withered, but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour.
<p/>Yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in one's own race, nearer perhaps in type and temperament, many of them, and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious.
<p/>There were times when it appeared to Dorian Gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own life, not as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had lived it in act and circumstance, but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) imagination had created it for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), as it had been in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) brain and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) passions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had known them all, those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety.
<p/>They seemed to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) went. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that in some mysterious way their lives had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own.
<p/>In the seventh chapter he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) tells how, crowned with laurel, lest lightning might strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had sat, as Tiberius, in a garden at Capri, reading the shameful books of Elephantis, while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) and the flute-player mocked the swinger of the censer; and, as Caligula, had caroused with the green-shirted jockeys in their stables and supped in an ivory manger with a jewel-frontleted horse; and, as Domitian, had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors, looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>) days, and sick with that ennui, that terrible taedium vitae , that comes on those to whom life denies nothing; and had peered through a clear emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then, in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by silver-shod mules, been carried through the Street of Pomegranates to a House of Gold and heard men cry on Nero Caesar as he (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) passed by; and, as Elagabalus, had painted his (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) face with colours, and plied the distaff among the women, and brought the Moon from Carthage and given her (<font color='blue'><b>Caesar</b></font>) in mystic marriage to the Sun.
<p/>Over and over again Dorian used to read this fantastic chapter, and the two chapters immediately following, in which, as in some curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels, were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made monstrous or mad:
<p/>Filippo, Duke of Milan, who slew his (<font color='blue'><b>Filippo</b></font>) wife and painted her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lips with a scarlet poison that her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) lover might suck death from the dead thing he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) fondled; Pietro Barbi, the Venetian, known as Paul the Second, who sought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Paul</b></font>) vanity to assume the title of Formosus, and whose tiara, valued at two hundred
<p/>thousand florins, was bought at the price of a terrible sin; Gian Maria Visconti, who used hounds to chase living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Visconti</b></font>); the Borgia on his (<font color='blue'><b>Visconti</b></font>) white horse, with Fratricide riding beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Visconti</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Visconti</b></font>) mantle stained with the blood o
<p/>f Perotto; Pietro Riario, the young Cardinal Archbishop of Florence, child and minion of Sixtus IV, whose beauty was equalled only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>) debauchery, and who received Leonora of Aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk, filled with nymphs and centaurs, and gilded a boy that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might serve at t
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) feast as Ganymede or Hylas; Ezzelin, whose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death, and who had a passion for red blood, as other men have for red wine--the son of the Fiend, as was reported, and one who had cheated his (<font color='blue'><b>Fiend</b></font>) father at dice when gambling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Fiend</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Fiend</b></font>) own soul; Giam
<p/>battista Cibo, who in mockery took the name of Innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a Jewish doctor; Sigismondo Malatesta, the lover of Isotta and the lord of Rimini, whose effigy was burned at Rome as the enemy of God and man, who strangled Polyssena with a na
<p/>pkin, and gave poison to Ginevra d'Este in a cup of emerald, and in honour of a shameful passion built a pagan church for Christian worship; Charles VI, who had so wildly adored his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brother's wife that a leper had warned him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) of the insanity that was coming on him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and who, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) brain had sickene
<p/>d and grown strange, could only be soothed by Saracen cards painted with the images of love and death and madness; and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls, Grifonetto Baglioni, who slew Astorre with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) bride, and Simonetto with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) page, and whose comeliness was such that
<p/>, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) lay dying in the yellow piazza of Perugia, those who had hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could not choose but weep, and Atalanta, who had cursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), blessed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
<p/>The hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) life had himself known this curious fancy. There was a horrible fascination in them all.
<p/>The Renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoning--poisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch, by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan, by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) saw them at night, and they troubled his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) imagination in the day. Dorian Gray had been poisoned by a book.
<p/>There were moments when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) looked on evil simply as a mode through which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) could realize his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) conception of the beautiful.
<p/>CHAPTER 12 It was on the ninth of November, the eve of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own thirty-eighth birthday, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) often remembered afterwards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was walking home about eleven o'clock from Lord Henry's, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been dining, and was wrapped in heavy furs, as the night was cold and foggy.
<p/>At the corner of Grosvenor Square and South Audley Street, a man passed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the mist, walking very fast and with the collar of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grey ulster turned up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a bag in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. Dorian recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). It was Basil Hallward. A strange sense of fear, for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) could not account, came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own house. But Hallward had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>).
<p/>Dorian heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) first stopping on the pavement and then hurrying after him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). In a few moments, his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand was on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) arm.
<p/>'' Dorian! What an extraordinary piece of luck! I have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine o'clock.
<p/>Finally I took pity on your tired servant and told him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) to go to bed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) let me out. I am off to Paris by the midnight train, and I particularly wanted to see you before I left.
<p/>I thought it was you, or rather your fur coat, as you passed me. But I wasn't quite sure. Didn't you recognize me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``In this fog, my dear Basil? Why, I can't even recognize Grosvenor Square. I believe my house is somewhere about here, but I don't feel at all certain about it.
<p/>I am sorry you are going away, as I have not seen you for ages. But I suppose you will be back soon?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I intend to take a studio in Paris and shut myself up till I have finished a great picture I have in my head.
<p/>'' No: I am going to be out of England for six months. However, it wasn't about myself I wanted to talk.
<p/>Here we are at your door. Let me come in for a moment. I have something to say to you.'' <div class="bookquote">``I shall be charmed.
<p/>But won't you miss your train?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian Gray languidly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) passed up the steps and opened the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) latch-key.
<p/>The lamplight struggled out through the fog, and Hallward looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) watch. '' I have heaps of time,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' The train doesn't go till twelve-fifteen, and it is only just eleven. In fact, I was on my way to the club to look for you, when I met you.
<p/>You see, I shan't have any delay about luggage, as I have sent on my heavy things. All I have with me is in this bag, and I can easily get to Victoria in twenty minutes.
<p/>'' Dorian looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) and smiled. '' What a way for a fashionable painter to travel! A Gladstone bag and an ulster!
<p/>Come in, or the fog will get into the house. And mind you don't talk about anything serious. Nothing is serious nowadays.
<p/>At least nothing should be. '' Hallward shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) head, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) entered, and followed Dorian into the library. There was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth.
<p/>The lamps were lit, and an open Dutch silver spirit-case stood, with some siphons of soda-water and large cut-glass tumblers, on a little marqueterie table.
<p/>'' You see your servant made me quite at home, Dorian. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) gave me everything I wanted, including your best gold-tipped cigarettes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is a most hospitable creature. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) much better than the Frenchman you used to have. What has become of the Frenchman, by the bye?''
<p/>Dorian shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shoulders. '' I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) married Lady Radley's maid, and has established her (<font color='blue'><b>Radley</b></font>) in Paris as an English dressmaker.
<p/>Anglomania is very fashionable over there now, I hear. It seems silly of the French, doesn't it? But--do you know?--he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was not at all a bad servant.
<p/>I never liked him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), but I had nothing to complain about. One often imagines things that are quite absurd. He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) went away.
<p/>Have another brandy-and-soda? Or would you like hock-and-seltzer? I always take hock-and-seltzer myself. There is sure to be some in the next room.''
<p/>Thanks, I won't have anything more,'' said the painter, taking his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) cap and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) had placed in the corner.
<p/>'' '' And now, my dear fellow, I want to speak to you seriously. Don't frown like that. You make it so much more difficult for me.
<p/>'' '' What is it all about?'' cried Dorian in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) petulant way, flinging himself down on the sofa. '' I hope it is not about myself.
<p/>I am tired of myself to-night. I should like to be somebody else.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is about yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>answered Hallward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) grave deep voice, <div class="bookquote">``and I must say it to you.
<p/>I shall only keep you half an hour. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>Dorian sighed and lit a cigarette. '' Half an hour! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured.
<p/>It is not much to ask of you, Dorian, and it is entirely for your own sake that I am speaking.
<p/>'' I think it right that you should know that the most dreadful things are being said against you in London.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't wish to know anything about them. I love scandals about other people, but scandals about myself don't interest me.
<p/>They have not got the charm of novelty. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``They must interest you, Dorian. Every gentleman is interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) good name.
<p/>You don't want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded. Of course, you have your position, and your wealth, and all that kind of thing.
<p/>But position and wealth are not everything. Mind you, I don't believe these rumours at all. At least, I can't believe them when I see you.
<p/>Sin is a thing that writes itself across a man's face. It cannot be concealed. People talk sometimes of secret vices.
<p/>If a wretched man has a vice, it shows itself in the lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mouth, the droop of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyelids, the moulding of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hands even.
<p/>There are no such things. Somebody--I won't mention his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name, but you know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--came to me last year to have his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) portrait done.
<p/>I had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before, and had never heard anything about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the time, though I have heard a good deal since.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offered an extravagant price. I refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). There was something in the shape of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fingers that I hated. I know now that I was quite right in what I fancied about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life is dreadful. But you, Dorian, with your pure, bright, innocent face, and your marvellous untroubled youth--I can't believe anything against you.
<p/>And yet I see you very seldom, and you never come down to the studio now, and when I am away from you, and I hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you
<p/>Why is it, Dorian, that a man like the Duke of Berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it?
<p/>, I don't know what to say. Why is it that so many gentlemen in London will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs?
<p/>Your name happened to come up in conversation, in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the Dudley.
<p/>Staveley curled his (<font color='blue'><b>Dudley</b></font>) lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes, but that you were a man whom no pure-minded girl should be allowed to know, and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with.
<p/>You used to be a friend of Lord Staveley. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) at dinner last week. I reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) that I was a friend of yours, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) meant.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) told me right out before everybody. It was horrible! Why is your friendship so fatal to young men?
<p/>There was that wretched boy in the Guards who committed suicide. You were his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) great friend. There was Sir Henry Ashton, who had to leave England with a tarnished name.
<p/>You and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) were inseparable. What about Adrian Singleton and his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) dreadful end? What about Lord Kent's only son and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) career?
<p/>I met his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) father yesterday in St. James's Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) seemed broken with shame and sorrow. What about the young Duke of Perth?
<p/>You are talking about things of which you know nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian Gray, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lip, and with a note of infinite contempt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) voice.
<p/>What sort of life has he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) got now? What gentleman would associate with him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``Stop, Basil. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>You ask me why Berwick leaves a room when I enter it.
<p/>It is because I know everything about his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) life, not because he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) knows anything about mine. With such blood as he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) veins, how could his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) record be clean?
<p/>You ask me about Henry Ashton and young Perth. Did I teach the one his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) vices, and the other his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) debauchery?
<p/>If Kent's silly son takes his (<font color='blue'><b>Ashton</b></font>) wife from the streets, what is that to me? If Adrian Singleton writes his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) friend's name across a bill, am I his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) keeper?
<p/>The middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross dinner-tables, and whisper about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with the people they slander.
<p/>In this country, it is enough for a man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I know how people chatter in England. And what sort of lives do these people, who pose as being moral, lead themselves?
<p/>My dear fellow, you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite.'' <div class="bookquote">``Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>cried Hallward, <div class="bookquote">``that is not the question.
<p/>England is bad enough I know, and English society is all wrong. That is the reason why I want you to be fine.
<p/>You have not been fine. One has a right to judge of a man by the effect he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friends.
<p/>Yours seem to lose all sense of honour, of goodness, of purity. You have filled them with a madness for pleasure.
<p/>They have gone down into the depths. You led them there. Yes: you led them there, and yet you can smile, as you are smiling now.
<p/>And there is worse behind. I know you and Harry are inseparable. Surely for that reason, if for none other, you should not have made his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sister's name a by-word.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Take care, Basil. You go too far. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must speak, and you must listen. You shall listen. When you met Lady Gwendolen, not a breath of scandal had ever touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Gwendolen</b></font>).
<p/>Is there a single decent woman in London now who would drive with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in the park? Why, even her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) children are not allowed to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Then there are other stories--stories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in London.
<p/>Are they true? Can they be true? When I first heard them, I laughed. I hear them now, and they make me shudder.
<p/>What about your country-house and the life that is led there? Dorian, you don't know what is said about you. I won't tell you that I don't want to preach to you.
<p/>I remember Harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that, and then proceeded to break his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) word.
<p/>I do want to preach to you. I want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you.
<p/>I want you to have a clean name and a fair record. I want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with.
<p/>Don't shrug your shoulders like that. Don't be so indifferent. You have a wonderful influence. Let it be for good, not for evil.
<p/>They say that you corrupt every one with whom you become intimate, and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after.
<p/>I don't know whether it is so or not. How should I know? But it is said of you. I am told things that it seems impossible to doubt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) showed me a letter that his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) wife had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was dying alone in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) villa at Mentone.
<p/>Lord Gloucester was one of my greatest friends at Oxford. Your name was implicated in the most terrible confession I ever read.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) that it was absurd--that I knew you thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind.
<p/>Know you? I wonder do I know you? Before I could answer that, I should have to see your soul.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>To see my soul! '' muttered Dorian Gray, starting up from the sofa and turning almost white from fear. '' Yes,'' answered Hallward gravely, and with deep-toned sorrow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">``to see your soul.
<p/>But only God can do that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hallward/Basil Hallward/Basil</b></font>)</div>A bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man. ''
<p/>You shall see it yourself, to-night! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried, seizing a lamp from the table. '' Come: it is your own handiwork.
<p/>Why shouldn't you look at it? You can tell the world all about it afterwards, if you choose. Nobody would believe you.
<p/>If they did believe you, they would like me all the better for it. I know the age better than you do, though you will prate about it so tediously.
<p/>Come, I tell you. You have chattered enough about corruption. Now you shall look on it face to face. '' There was the madness of pride in every word he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) uttered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) felt a terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) secret, and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shame was to be burdened for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) life with the hideous memory of what he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had done.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stamped his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) foot upon the ground in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) boyish insolent manner. '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) continued, coming closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and looking steadfastly into his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stern eyes, <div class="bookquote">``I shall show you my soul.
<p/>You shall see the thing that you fancy only God can see. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Hallward started back. '' This is blasphemy, Dorian!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' You must not say things like that. They are horrible, and they don't mean anything. '' <div class="bookquote">``You think so? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) laughed again. '' I know so. As for what I said to you to-night, I said it for your good.
<p/>You know I have been always a stanch friend to you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't touch me. Finish what you have to say. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the painter</b></font>)</div><p/>A twisted flash of pain shot across the painter's face. He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) paused for a moment, and a wild feeling of pity came over him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>).
<p/>After all, what right had he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) to pry into the life of Dorian Gray? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>), how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) must have suffered!
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) straightened himself up, and walked over to the fire-place, and stood there, looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame.
<p/>'' I am waiting, Basil,'' said the young man in a hard clear voice. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned round. '' What I have to say is this,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' You must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you. If you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end, I shall believe you.
<p/>Deny them, Dorian, deny them! Can't you see what I am going through? My God! don't tell me that you are bad, and corrupt, and shameful.
<p/>'' Dorian Gray smiled. There was a curl of contempt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lips. '' Come upstairs, Basil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) said quietly. ''
<p/>I keep a diary of my life from day to day, and it never leaves the room in which it is written.
<p/>I shall show it to you if you come with me.'' <div class="bookquote">``I shall come with you, Dorian, if you wish it.
<p/>I see I have missed my train. That makes no matter. I can go to-morrow. But don't ask me to read anything to-night.
<p/>All I want is a plain answer to my question.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That shall be given to you upstairs. I could not give it here.
<p/>You will not have to read long. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER 13 He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) passed out of the room and began the ascent, Basil Hallward following close behind.
<p/>They walked softly, as men do instinctively at night. The lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase. A rising wind made some of the windows rattle.
<p/>When they reached the top landing, Dorian set the lamp down on the floor, and taking out the key, turned it in the lock.
<p/>'' You insist on knowing, Basil? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) asked in a low voice. '' Yes.'' <div class="bookquote">``I am delighted,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) answered, smiling.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) added, somewhat harshly, <div class="bookquote">``You are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me.
<p/>You have had more to do with my life than you think'' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and, taking up the lamp, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) opened the door and went in.
<p/>A cold current of air passed them, and the light shot up for a moment in a flame of murky orange.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) shuddered. '' Shut the door behind you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) whispered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) placed the lamp on the table. Hallward glanced round him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) with a puzzled expression.
<p/>A faded Flemish tapestry, a curtained picture, an old Italian cassone , and an almost empty book-case--that was all that it seemed to contain, besides a chair and a table.
<p/>As Dorian Gray was lighting a half-burned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes.
<p/>The room looked as if it had not been lived in for years. A mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting. There was a damp odour of mildew.
<p/>'' So you think that it is only God who sees the soul, Basil? Draw that curtain back, and you will see mine.
<p/>'' The voice that spoke was cold and cruel. '' You are mad, Dorian, or playing a part,'' muttered Hallward, frowning.
<p/>Then I must do it myself,'' said the young man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tore the curtain from its rod and flung it on the ground.
<p/>An exclamation of horror broke from the painter's lips as he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) saw in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>).
<p/>'' You won't? There was something in its expression that filled him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) with disgust and loathing. Good heavens! it was Dorian Gray's own face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was looking at!
<p/>The horror, whatever it was, had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous beauty. There was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth.
<p/>The sodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue, the noble curves had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat.
<p/>Yes, it was Dorian himself. But who had done it? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) seemed to recognize his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own brushwork, and the frame was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own design.
<p/>The idea was monstrous, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt afraid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) seized the lighted candle, and held it to the picture. In the left-hand corner was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own name, traced in long letters of bright vermilion.
<p/>It was some foul parody, some infamous ignoble satire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had never done that. Still, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own picture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) knew it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own picture! What did it mean? Why had it altered? He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) turned and looked at Dorian Gray with the eyes of a sick man.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) mouth twitched, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) parched tongue seemed unable to articulate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) forehead. It was dank with clammy sweat.
<p/>The young man was leaning against the mantelshelf, watching him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting.
<p/>There was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy. There was simply the passion of the spectator, with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) had taken the flower out of his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) coat, and was smelling it, or pretending to do so. '' What does this mean?
<p/>Years ago, when I was a boy,'' said Dorian Gray, crushing the flower in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand, <div class="bookquote">``you met me, flattered me, and taught me to be vain of my good looks.
<p/>One day you introduced me to a friend of yours, who explained to me the wonder of youth, and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty.
<p/>In a mad moment that, even now, I don't know whether I regret or not, I made a wish, perhaps you would call it a prayer...
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Hallward, at last. His (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own voice sounded shrill and curious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) ears. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I remember it! Oh, how well I remember it!
<p/>No! the thing is impossible. The room is damp. Mildew has got into the canvas. The paints I used had some wretched mineral poison in them.
<p/>I tell you the thing is impossible.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah, what is impossible? ''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>murmured the young man, going over to the window and leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead against the cold, mist-stained glass.
<p/>'' You told me you had destroyed it.'' <div class="bookquote">``I was wrong. It has destroyed me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't believe it is my picture.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Can't you see your ideal in it?'' said Dorian bitterly. '' My ideal, as you call it... '' '' As you called it.''
<p/>'' There was nothing evil in it, nothing shameful. You were to me such an ideal as I shall never meet again.
<p/>This is the face of a satyr.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is the face of my soul. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Christ! what a thing I must have worshipped!
<p/>It has the eyes of a devil.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Each of us has heaven and hell in him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>), Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian with a wild gesture of despair.
<p/>If it is true,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``and this is what you have done with your life, why, you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it. '' My God! He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) held the light up again to the canvas and examined it.
<p/>The surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had left it. It was from within, apparently, that the foulness and horror had come.
<p/>Through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away. The rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand shook, and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and lay there sputtering. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) placed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) foot on it and put it out.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and buried his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hands.
<p/>'' Good God, Dorian, what a lesson! What an awful lesson! '' There was no answer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) could hear the young man sobbing at the window.
<p/>'' Pray, Dorian, pray,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured. '' What is it that one was taught to say in one's boyhood? ' Lead us not into temptation.
<p/>Forgive us our sins. Wash away our iniquities.' Let us say that together. The prayer of your pride has been answered.
<p/>The prayer of your repentance will be answered also. I worshipped you too much. I am punished for it. You worshipped yourself too much.
<p/>We are both punished. '' Dorian Gray turned slowly around and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) with tear-dimmed eyes. '' It is too late, Basil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) faltered.
<p/>'' It is never too late, Dorian. Let us kneel down and try if we cannot remember a prayer. Isn't there a verse somewhere, `Though your sins be as scarlet, yet I will make them as white as snow'?''
<p/>'' Those words mean nothing to me now. '' <div class="bookquote">``Hush! Don't say that. You have done enough evil in your life.
<p/>Dorian Gray glanced at the picture, and suddenly an uncontrollable feeling of hatred for Basil Hallward came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), as though it had been suggested to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) by the image on the canvas, whispered into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) ear by those grinning lips.
<p/>The mad passions of a hunted animal stirred within him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) loathed the man who was seated at the table, more than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) whole life he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had ever loathed anything.
<p/>My God! Don't you see that accursed thing leering at us?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) glanced wildly around. Something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>It was a knife that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had brought up, some days before, to cut a piece of cord, and had forgotten to take away with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eye fell on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew what it was. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) moved slowly towards it, passing Hallward as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) did so.
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) got behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) seized it and turned round. Hallward stirred in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) chair as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was going to rise.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) rushed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear, crushing the man's head down on the table and stabbing again and again.
<p/>There was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood. Three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively, waving grotesque, stiff-fingered hands in the air.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stabbed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) twice more, but the man did not move. Something began to trickle on the floor. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited for a moment, still pressing the head down.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) threw the knife on the table, and listened. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear nothing, but the drip, drip on the threadbare carpet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened the door and went out on the landing. The house was absolutely quiet. No one was about. For a few seconds he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood bending over the balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness.
<p/>The thing was still seated in the chair, straining over the table with bowed head, and humped back, and long fantastic arms.
<p/>Had it not been for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was slowly widening on the table, one would have said that the man was simply asleep.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took out the key and returned to the room, locking himself in as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did so. How quickly it had all been done!
<p/>The wind had blown the fog away, and the sky was like a monstrous peacock's tail, starred with myriads of golden eyes.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked down and saw the policeman going his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rounds and flashing the long beam of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lantern on the doors of the silent houses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt strangely calm, and walking over to the window, opened it and stepped out on the balcony. The crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner and then vanished.
<p/>A woman in a fluttering shawl was creeping slowly by the railings, staggering as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went. Now and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped and peered back.
<p/>Once, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) began to sing in a hoarse voice. The policeman strolled over and said something to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stumbled away, laughing.
<p/>A bitter blast swept across the square. The gas-lamps flickered and became blue, and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches to and fro.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) shivered and went back, closing the window behind him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>). Having reached the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) turned the key and opened it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) did not even glance at the murdered man. He (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realize the situation.
<p/>The friend who had painted the fatal portrait to which all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) misery had been due had gone out of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life.
<p/>It was a rather curious one of Moorish workmanship, made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished steel, and studded with coarse turquoises.
<p/>That was enough. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) remembered the lamp. Perhaps it might be missed by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) servant, and questions would be asked.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hesitated for a moment, then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turned back and took it from the table. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not help seeing the dead thing.
<p/>How still it was! How horribly white the long hands looked! It was like a dreadful wax image. Having locked the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) crept quietly downstairs.
<p/>The woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stopped several times and waited. No: everything was still.
<p/>It was merely the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own footsteps. When he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) reached the library, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw the bag and coat in the corner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) unlocked a secret press that was in the wainscoting, a press in which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own curious disguises, and put them into it.
<p/>They must be hidden away somewhere. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could easily burn them afterwards. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) pulled out his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) watch. It was twenty minutes to two.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sat down and began to think. Every year--every month, almost--men were strangled in England for what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had done. There had been a madness of murder in the air.
<p/>Some red star had come too close to the earth.... And yet, what evidence was there against him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)? Basil Hallward had left the house at eleven.
<p/>No one had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) come in again. Most of the servants were at Selby Royal. His (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) valet had gone to bed....
<p/>Paris! Yes. It was to Paris that Basil had gone, and by the midnight train, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had intended. With his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) curious reserved habits, it would be months before any suspicions would be roused.
<p/>Months! Everything could be destroyed long before then. A sudden thought struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) fur coat and hat and went out into the hall.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) paused, hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the bull's-eye reflected in the window.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) waited and held his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) breath. After a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) drew back the latch and slipped out, shutting the door very gently behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>).
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) began ringing the bell. In about five minutes his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) valet appeared, half-dressed and looking very drowsy. '' I am sorry to have had to wake you up, Francis,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) said, stepping in;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but I had forgotten my latch-key. What time is it?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Ten minutes past two, sir,'' answered the man, looking at the clock and blinking.
<p/>'' Ten minutes past two? How horribly late! You must wake me at nine to-morrow. I have some work to do.
<p/>'' '' All right, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Did any one call this evening?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Hallward</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Hallward, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) stayed here till eleven, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) went away to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) train.''
<p/>'' Oh! I am sorry I didn't see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) leave any message?'' '' No, sir, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would write to you from Paris, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) did not find you at the club.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That will do, Francis. Don't forget to call me at nine to-morrow.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, sir. '' The man shambled down the passage in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slippers.
<p/>Dorian Gray threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hat and coat upon the table and passed into the library. For a quarter of an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) walked up and down the room, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lip and thinking.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) took down the Blue Book from one of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves. '' Alan Campbell, 152, Hertford Street, Mayfair.
<p/>At nine o'clock the next morning his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters.
<p/>'' Yes; that was the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wanted. CHAPTER 14 Dorian was sleeping quite peacefully, lying on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) right side, with one hand underneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>The man had to touch him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) twice on the shoulder before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) woke, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes a faint smile passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips, as though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been lost in some delightful dream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked like a boy who had been tired out with play, or study. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not dreamed at all.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain. But youth smiles without any reason. It is one of its chiefest charms.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned round, and leaning upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elbow, began to sip his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chocolate. The mellow November sun came streaming into the room.
<p/>The sky was bright, and there was a genial warmth in the air. It was almost like a morning in May.
<p/>Gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent, blood-stained feet into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) winced at the memory of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had suffered, and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for Basil Hallward that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) sat in the chair came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) grew cold with passion.
<p/>The dead man was still sitting there, too, and in the sunlight now. How horrible that was! Such hideous things were for the darkness, not for the day.
<p/>There were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them, strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions, and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy, greater than any joy they brought, or could ever bring, to the senses.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brooded on what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had gone through he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would sicken or grow mad. But this was not one of them.
<p/>It was a thing to be driven out of the mind, to be drugged with poppies, to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself.
<p/>When the half-hour struck, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forehead, and then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual care, giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) necktie and scarf-pin and changing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rings more than once.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spent a long time also over breakfast, tasting the various dishes, talking to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) valet about some new liveries that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was thinking of getting made for the servants at Selby, and going through his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) correspondence.
<p/>At some of the letters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) smiled. Three of them bored him (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>). One he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) read several times over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) face.
<p/>After he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) had drunk his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) cup of black coffee, he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) lips slowly with a napkin, motioned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) servant to wait, and going over to the table, sat down and wrote two letters.
<p/>'' That awful thing, a woman's memory!'' as Lord Henry had once said. One he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) put in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pocket, the other he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) handed to the valet.
<p/>'' Take this round to 152, Hertford Street, Francis, and if Mr. Campbell is out of town, get his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) address. ''
<p/>As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a piece of paper, drawing first flowers and bits of architecture, and then human faces.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) remarked that every face that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) drew seemed to have a fantastic likeness to Basil Hallward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) frowned, and getting up, went over to the book-case and took out a volume at hazard.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) would not think about what had happened until it became absolutely necessary that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) should do so.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had stretched himself on the sofa, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) looked at the title-page of the book. It was Gautier's Emaux et Camees, Charpentier's Japanese-paper edition, with the Jacquemart etching.
<p/>The binding was of citron-green leather, with a design of gilt trellis-work and dotted pomegranates. It had been given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charpentier</b></font>) by Adrian Singleton.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) turned over the pages, his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) eye fell on the poem about the hand of Lacenaire, the cold yellow hand '' du supplice encore mal lavee ,'' with its downy red hairs and its '' doigts de faune .
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) own white taper fingers, shuddering slightly in spite of himself, and passed on, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) came to those lovely stanzas upon Venice: Sur une gamme chromatique, Le sein de perles ruisselant, La Venus de l'Adriatique Sort de l'eau son corps rose et blanc.
<p/>Les domes, sur l'azur des ondes Suivant la phrase au pur contour, S'enflent comme des gorges rondes Que souleve un soupir d'amour.
<p/>'' L'esquif aborde et me depose, Jetant son amarre au pilier, Devant une facade rose, Sur le marbre d'un escalier. How exquisite they were!
<p/>As one read them, one seemed to be floating down the green water-ways of the pink and pearl city, seated in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains.
<p/>The mere lines looked to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) like those straight lines of turquoise-blue that follow one as one pushes out to the Lido.
<p/>The sudden flashes of colour reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) of the gleam of the opal-and-iris-throated birds that flutter round the tall honeycombed Campanile, or stalk, with such stately grace, through the dim, dust-stained arcades.
<p/>Leaning back with half-closed eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) kept saying over and over to himself: <div class="bookquote">``Devant une facade rose, Sur le marbre d'un escalier.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) remembered the autumn that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had passed there, and a wonderful love that had stirred him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to mad delightful follies.
<p/>But Venice, like Oxford, had kept the background for romance, and, to the true romantic, background was everything, or almost everything.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The whole of Venice was in those two lines. There was romance in every place. Basil had been with him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) part of the time, and had gone wild over Tintoret.
<p/>Poor Basil! What a horrible way for a man to die! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sighed, and took up the volume again, and tried to forget.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little cafe at Smyrna where the Hadjis sit counting their amber beads and
<p/>the turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) read of the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot, lotus-covered Nile, where there are Sphinxes, and rose-red ibises, and white vultures with gilded claws, and crocodiles with small beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) began to brood over those verses which, drawing music from kiss-stained marble, tell of that curious statue that Gautier compares to a contralto voice, the '' monstre charmant '' that couches in the porphyry-room of the Louvre.
<p/>But after a time the book fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew nervous, and a horrible fit of terror came over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>What if Alan Campbell should be out of England? Days would elapse before he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) could come back. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) might refuse to come.
<p/>What could he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) do then? Every moment was of vital importance. They had been great friends once, five years before--almost inseparable, indeed.
<p/>Then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end. When they met in society now, it was only Dorian Gray who smiled: Alan Campbell never did.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was an extremely clever young man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had no real appreciation of the visible arts, and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) possessed he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had gained entirely from Dorian.
<p/>At Cambridge he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had spent a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) time working in the laboratory, and had taken a good class in the Natural Science Tripos of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) year.
<p/>Indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was still devoted to the study of chemistry, and had a laboratory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) used to shut himself up all day long, greatly to the annoyance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) mother, who had set her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) standing for Parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up prescriptions.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) dominant intellectual passion was for science. He (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) was an excellent musician, however, as well, and played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs.
<p/>In fact, it was music that had first brought him (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) and Dorian Gray together--music and that indefinable attraction that Dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) wished--and, indeed, exercised often without being conscious of it.
<p/>They had met at Lady Berkshire's the night that Rubinstein played there, and after that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on.
<p/>For eighteen months their intimacy lasted. Campbell was always either at Selby Royal or in Grosvenor Square. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>), as to many others, Dorian Gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life.
<p/>But suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they met and that Campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which Dorian Gray was present.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had changed, too--was strangely melancholy at times, appeared almost to dislike hearing music, and would never himself play, giving as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) excuse, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was called upon, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was so absorbed in science that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had no time left in which to practise.
<p/>Every day he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) seemed to become more interested in biology, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) name appeared once or twice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious experiments.
<p/>Whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew. And this was certainly true. This was the man Dorian Gray was waiting for.
<p/>Every second he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) kept glancing at the clock. As the minutes went by he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) became horribly agitated. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) got up and began to pace up and down the room, looking like a beautiful caged thing.
<p/>Time seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to be crawling with feet of lead, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) by monstrous winds was being swept towards the jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) knew what was waiting for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) there; saw it, indeed, and, shuddering, crushed with dank hands his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) burning lids as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) would have robbed the very brain of sight and driven the eyeballs back into their cave.
<p/>The brain had its own food on which it battened, and the imagination, made grotesque by terror, twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain, danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving masks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) took long stealthy strides. His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hands were curiously cold. The suspense became unbearable. It was useless. Then, suddenly, time stopped for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>Yes: that blind, slow-breathing thing crawled no more, and horrible thoughts, time being dead, raced nimbly on in front, and dragged a hideous future from its grave, and showed it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stared at it. Its very horror made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stone. At last the door opened and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) servant entered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) turned glazed eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>'' Mr. Campbell, sir,'' said the man. A sigh of relief broke from his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) parched lips, and the colour came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) cheeks.
<p/>'' Ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) to come in at once, Francis. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) was himself again. His (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) mood of cowardice had passed away.
<p/>In a few moments, Alan Campbell walked in, looking very stern and rather pale, his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) pallor being intensified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) coal-black hair and dark eyebrows.
<p/>The man bowed and retired. '' Alan! This is kind of you. I thank you for coming. '' <div class="bookquote">``I had intended never to enter your house again, Gray.
<p/>But you said it was a matter of life and death. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) voice was hard and cold. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) spoke with slow deliberation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hands in the pockets of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) Astrakhan coat, and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had been greeted.
<p/>There was a look of contempt in the steady searching gaze that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) turned on Dorian. '' Yes: it is a matter of life and death, Alan, and to more than one person.
<p/>Sit down. '' Campbell took a chair by the table, and Dorian sat opposite to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). The two men's eyes met.
<p/>After a strained moment of silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) leaned across and said, very quietly, but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had sent for, <div class="bookquote">``Alan, in a locked room at the top of this house, a room to which nobody but myself has access, a dead man is seated at a table.
<p/>In Dorian's there was infinite pity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) knew that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was going to do was dreadful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) has been dead ten hours now.
<p/>Don't stir, and don't look at me like that. Who the man is, why he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died, how he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) died, are matters that do not concern you.
<p/>What you have to do is this-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Stop, Gray. I don't want to know anything further. Whether what you have told me is true or not true doesn't concern me.
<p/>I entirely decline to be mixed up in your life. Keep your horrible secrets to yourself. They don't interest me any more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Alan/Campbell/Alan Campbell</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Alan, they will have to interest you. This one will have to interest you. I am awfully sorry for you, Alan.
<p/>But I can't help myself. You are the one man who is able to save me. I am forced to bring you into the matter.
<p/>I have no option. Alan, you are scientific. You know about chemistry and things of that kind. You have made experiments.
<p/>What you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairs--to destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left.
<p/>Nobody saw this person come into the house. Indeed, at the present moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) is supposed to be in Paris. He (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) will not be missed for months.
<p/>You, Alan, you must change him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>), and everything that belongs to him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>), into a handful of ashes that I may scatter in the air.''
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) is missed, there must be no trace of him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) found here. <div class="bookquote">``You are mad, Dorian.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mad, I tell you--mad to imagine that I would raise a finger to help you, mad to make this monstrous confession.

<p/>I should not be sorry to see you disgraced, publicly disgraced. How dare you ask me, of all men in the world, to mix myself up in this horror?
<p/>I should have thought you knew more about people's characters. Your friend Lord Henry Wotton can't have taught you much about psychology, whatever else he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) has taught you.
<p/>Nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you. You have come to the wrong man. Go to some of your friends.
<p/>Don't come to me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alan, it was murder. I killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>). You don't know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) had made me suffer.

<p/>poor Harry has had. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) may not have intended it, the result was the same. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Murder! Good God, Dorian, is that what you have come to?
<p/>I shall not inform upon you. It is not my business. Besides, without my stirring in the matter, you are certain to be arrested.

<p/>Wait, wait a moment; listen to me. Only listen, Alan. All I ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment.
<p/>If in some hideous dissecting-room or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through, you would simply look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as an admirable subject.
<p/>You go to hospitals and dead-houses, and the horrors that you do there don't affect you. You would not turn a hair.
<p/>On the contrary, you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race, or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world, or gratifying intellectual curiosity, or something of that kind.
<p/>You would not believe that you were doing anything wrong. What I want you to do is merely what you have often done before.
<p/>Indeed, to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at. And, remember, it is the only piece of evidence against me.
<p/>If it is discovered, I am lost; and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have no desire to help you.
<p/>You forget that. I am simply indifferent to the whole thing. It has nothing to do with me.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Alan, I entreat you.
<p/>Think of the position I am in. Just before you came I almost fainted with terror. You may know terror yourself some day.
<p/>No! don't think of that. Look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view. You don't inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from.
<p/>Don't inquire now. I have told you too much as it is. But I beg of you to do this. We were friends once, Alan.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't speak about those days, Dorian--they are dead.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The dead linger sometimes. The man upstairs will not go away.

<p/>They will hang me for what I have done.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' There is no good in prolonging this scene. I absolutely refuse to do anything in the matter.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I entreat you, Alan.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is useless. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>The same look of pity came into Dorian Gray's eyes.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand, took a piece of paper, and wrote something on it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) read it over twice, folded it carefully, and pushed it across the table.
<p/>Having done this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) got up and went over to the window. Campbell looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) in surprise, and then took up the paper, and opened it.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) read it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) face became ghastly pale and he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) fell back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) chair. A horrible sense of sickness came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<p/>After two or three minutes of terrible silence, Dorian turned round and came and stood behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>), putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow. '' I am so sorry for you, Alan,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``but you leave me no alternative.
<p/>I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the address. If you don't help me, I must send it.

<p/>It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you. You will do me the justice to admit that.
<p/>You were stern, harsh, offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me--no living man, at any rate.
<p/>I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate terms. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Campbell buried his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) hands, and a shudder passed through him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<p/>'' Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work yourself into this fever.
<p/>The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it. '' A groan broke from Campbell's lips and he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) shivered all over.
<p/>The ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony, each of which was too terrible to be borne.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) forehead, as if the disgrace with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was threatened had already come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<p/>The hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) shoulder weighed like a hand of lead. It was intolerable. It seemed to crush him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">``Come, Alan, you must decide at once.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) said, mechanically, as though words could alter things. '' You must. You have no choice.
<p/>Don't delay. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) hesitated a moment. '' Is there a fire in the room upstairs?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, there is a gas-fire with asbestos.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to go home and get some things from the laboratory.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Alan, you must not leave the house.
<p/>Write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Alan/Campbell/Alan Campbell</b></font>)</div>Campbell scrawled a few lines, blotted them, and addressed an envelope to his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) assistant. Dorian took the note up and read it carefully.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) rang the bell and gave it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) valet, with orders to return as soon as possible and to bring the things with him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).
<p/>As the hall door shut, Campbell started nervously, and having got up from the chair, went over to the chimney-piece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was shivering with a kind of ague.
<p/>For nearly twenty minutes, neither of the men spoke. A fly buzzed noisily about the room, and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer.
<p/>As the chime struck one, Campbell turned round, and looking at Dorian Gray, saw that his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) eyes were filled with tears.
<p/>There was something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). '' You are infamous, absolutely infamous!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) muttered.
<p/>'' Hush, Alan. You have saved my life,'' said Dorian. '' Your life? Good heavens! what a life that is! You have gone from corruption to corruption, and now you have culminated in crime.
<p/>In doing what I am going to do--what you force me to do--it is not of your life that I am thinking.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah, Alan,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>murmured Dorian with a sigh, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you had a thousandth part of the pity for me that I have for you.
<p/>After about ten minutes a knock came to the door, and the servant entered, carrying a large mahogany chest of chemicals, with a long coil of steel and platinum wire and two rather curiously shaped iron clamps.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) turned away as he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) spoke and stood looking out at the garden. Campbell made no answer. '' Shall I leave the things here, sir?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) asked Campbell. '' Yes,'' said Dorian. '' And I am afraid, Francis, that I have another errand for you.
<p/>You must go down to Richmond at once, see Harden personally, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Harden</b></font>) to send twice as many orchids as I ordered, and to have as few white ones as possible.
<p/>What is the name of the man at Richmond who supplies Selby with orchids?'' <div class="bookquote">``Harden, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes--Harden. In fact, I don't want any white ones.
<p/>It is a lovely day, Francis, and Richmond is a very pretty place--otherwise I wouldn't bother you about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No trouble, sir.
<p/>At what time shall I be back?'' Dorian looked at Campbell. '' How long will your experiment take, Alan? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) said in a calm indifferent voice.
<p/>The presence of a third person in the room seemed to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) extraordinary courage. Campbell frowned and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) lip.
<p/>'' It will take about five hours,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) answered. '' It will be time enough, then, if you are back at half-past seven, Francis.
<p/>Or stay: just leave my things out for dressing. You can have the evening to yourself. I am not dining at home, so I shall not want you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man, leaving the room. '' Now, Alan, there is not a moment to be lost. How heavy this chest is!
<p/>I'll take it for you. You bring the other things. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) spoke rapidly and in an authoritative manner. Campbell felt dominated by him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<p/>They left the room together. When they reached the top landing, Dorian took out the key and turned it in the lock.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) stopped, and a troubled look came into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shuddered. '' I don't think I can go in, Alan,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Alan</b></font>) murmured.
<p/>'' It is nothing to me. I don't require you,'' said Campbell coldly. Dorian half opened the door. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) did so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) saw the face of his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) portrait leering in the sunlight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) remembered that the night before he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had forgotten, for the first time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) life, to hide the fatal canvas, and was about to rush forward, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) drew back with a shudder.
<p/>What was that loathsome red dew that gleamed, wet and glistening, on one of the hands, as though the canvas had sweated blood?
<p/>How horrible it was!--more horrible, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) for the moment, than the silent thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) knew was stretched across the table, the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) that it had not stirred, but was still there, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had left it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) heaved a deep breath, opened the door a little wider, and with half-closed eyes and averted head, walked quickly in, determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would not look even once upon the dead man.
<p/>On the floor in front of it the torn curtain was lying. Then, stooping down and taking up the gold-and-purple hanging, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) flung it right over the picture.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) stopped, feeling afraid to turn round, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) heard Campbell bringing in the heavy chest, and the irons, and the other things that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had required for his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) dreadful work.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) began to wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) and Basil Hallward had ever met, and, if so, what they had thought of each other.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) turned and hurried out, just conscious that the dead man had been thrust back into the chair and that Campbell was gazing into a glistening yellow face.
<p/>'' Leave me now,'' said a stern voice behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was going downstairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) heard the key being turned in the lock.
<p/>It was long after seven when Campbell came back into the library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was pale, but absolutely calm. '' I have done what you asked me to do,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) muttered.
<p/>'' And now, good-bye. Let us never see each other again. '' <div class="bookquote">``You have saved me from ruin, Alan. I cannot forget that,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian simply.
<p/>As soon as Campbell had left, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) went upstairs. There was a horrible smell of nitric acid in the room. But the thing that had been sitting at the table was gone.
<p/>That evening, at eight-thirty, exquisitely dressed and wearing a large button-hole of Parma violets, Dorian Gray was ushered into Lady Narborough's drawing-room by bowing servants.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) forehead was throbbing with maddened nerves, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt wildly excited, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hostess's hand was as easy and graceful as ever.
<p/>Certainly no one looking at Dorian Gray that night could have believed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any tragedy of our age.
<p/>Those finely shaped fingers could never have clutched a knife for sin, nor those smiling lips have cried out on God and goodness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) himself could not help wondering at the calm of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) demeanour, and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life.
<p/>It was a small party, got up rather in a hurry by Lady Narborough, who was a very clever woman with what Lord Henry used to describe as the remains of really remarkable ugliness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) had proved an excellent wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors, and having buried her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) husband properly in a marble mausoleum, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) had herself designed, and married off her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) daughters to some rich, rather elderly men, she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) devoted herself now to the pleasures of French fiction, French cookery, and French esprit when she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) could get it.
<p/>Dorian was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) especial favourites, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) always told him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) was extremely glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) had not met him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) in early life.
<p/>I know, my dear, I should have fallen madly in love with you,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) used to say, <div class="bookquote">``and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake.
<p/>CHAPTER 15 Perhaps one never seems so much at one's ease as when one has to play a part. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time.
<p/>As it was, our bonnets were so unbecoming, and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind, that I never had even a flirtation with anybody.
<p/>However, that was all Narborough's fault. He (<font color='blue'><b>one</b></font>) was dreadfully short-sighted, and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who never sees anything.
<p/>The fact was, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) explained to Dorian, behind a very shabby fan, one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) married daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>), and, to make matters worse, had actually brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) husband with her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>).
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) guests this evening were rather tedious. '' I think it is most unkind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>), my dear,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) whispered.
<p/>Of course I go and stay with them every summer after I come from Homburg, but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes, and besides, I really wake them up.
<p/>They get up early, because they have so much to do, and go to bed early, because they have so little to think about.
<p/>There has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of Queen Elizabeth, and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner.
<p/>'' You don't know what an existence they lead down there. It is pure unadulterated country life. You shan't sit next either of them.
<p/>You shall sit by me and amuse me. '' Dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room. Yes: it was certainly a tedious party.
<p/>Two of the people he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had never seen before, and the others consisted of Ernest Harrowden, one of those middle-aged mediocrities so common in London clubs who have no enemies, but are thoroughly disliked by their friends; Lady Ruxton, an overdressed woman of forty-seven, with a hooked nose, who was always trying to get herself compromised, but was so peculiarly plain that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruxton</b></font>) great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against her (<font color='blue'><b>Ruxton</b></font>); Mrs. Erlynne, a pushing nobody, with a delightful lisp and Venetian-red hair; Lady Alice Chapman, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ernest</b></font>) hostess's daughter, a dowdy dull girl, with one of those characteristic British faces that, once seen, are never remembered; and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband, a red-cheeked, white-whiskered creature who, like so many of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) class, was under the impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of ideas.
<p/>gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the mauve-draped mantelshelf, exclaimed: ``How horrid of Henry Wotton to be so late!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) was rather sorry he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) had come, till Lady Narborough, looking at the great ormolu I sent round to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) this morning on chance and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wotton</b></font>) promised faithfully not to disappoint me.
<p/>It was some consolation that Harry was to be there, and when the door opened and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) slow musical voice lending charm to some insincere apology, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) ceased to feel bored.
<p/>Lady Narborough kept scolding him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">``an insult to poor Adolphe, who invented the menu specially for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
<p/>'' But at dinner he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) could not eat anything. Plate after plate went away untasted. now and then Lord Henry looked across at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), wondering at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) silence and abstracted manner.
<p/>From time to time the butler filled his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) glass with champagne. He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) drank eagerly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) thirst seemed to increase. ''
<p/>Dorian,'' said Lord Henry at last, as the chaud-froid was being handed round, ``what is the matter with you to-night? You are quite out of sorts.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is in love,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Narborough, <div class="bookquote">``and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is afraid to tell me for fear I should be jealous.
<p/>Dear Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div>murmured Dorian, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I have not been in love for a whole week--not, in fact, since Madame de Ferrol left town.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is quite right. I certainly should.'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``How you men can fall in love with that woman!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>exclaimed the old lady.
<p/>'' I really cannot understand it.'' <div class="bookquote">``It is simply because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) remembers you when you were a little girl, Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is the one link between us and your short frocks.'' ``She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) does not remember my short frocks at all, Lord Henry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is still decolletee ,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered, taking an olive in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) long fingers; <div class="bookquote">``and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is in a very smart gown she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) looks like an edition de luxe of a bad French novel.
<p/>But I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) very well at Vienna thirty years ago, and how decolletee she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) was then. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is really wonderful, and full of surprises.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) capacity for family affection is extraordinary. When her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) third husband died, her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) hair turned quite gold from grief. '' <div class="bookquote">``How can you, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian.
<p/>'' It is a most romantic explanation,'' laughed the hostess. '' But her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) third husband, Lord Henry! You don't mean to say Ferrol is the fourth?''
<p/>'' Certainly, Lady Narborough. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't believe a word of it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>'' Well, ask Mr. Gray. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) most intimate friends.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is it true, Mr. Gray?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) assures me so, Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian. '' I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) whether, like Marguerite de Navarre, she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) had their hearts embalmed and hung at her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) girdle.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) didn't, because none of them had had any hearts at all. '' <div class="bookquote">``Four husbands! Upon my word that is trop de zele .
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Trop d'audace , I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>),'' said Dorian. '' Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) is audacious enough for anything, my dear. And what is Ferrol like?
<p/>I don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``The husbands of very beautiful women belong to the criminal classes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry, sipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wine.
<p/>Lady Narborough hit him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) fan. '' Lord Henry, I am not at all surprised that the world says that you are extremely wicked.''
<p/>'' But what world says that?'' asked Lord Henry, elevating his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyebrows. '' It can only be the next world. This world and I are on excellent terms.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Everybody I know says you are very wicked,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head. Lord Henry looked serious for some moments.
<p/>It is perfectly monstrous,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, at last, <div class="bookquote">``the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind one's back that are absolutely and entirely true.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But really, if you all worship Madame de Ferrol in this ridiculous way, I shall have to marry again so as to be in the fashion.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Isn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) incorrigible?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>cried Dorian, leaning forward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) chair. '' I hope so,'' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hostess, laughing. '' <div class="bookquote">``You will never marry again, Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>broke in Lord Henry.
<p/>'' You were far too happy. When a woman marries again, it is because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) detested her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) first husband. When a man marries again, it is because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) adored his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first wife.
<p/>Women try their luck; men risk theirs.'' '' Narborough wasn't perfect,'' cried the old lady. '' If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been, you would not have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), my dear lady,'' was the rejoinder.
<p/>'' Women love us for our defects. If we have enough of them, they will forgive us everything, even our intellects.
<p/>You will never ask me to dinner again after saying this, I am afraid, Lady Narborough, but it is quite true.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course it is true, Lord Henry. If we women did not love you for your defects, where would you all be?
<p/>Not one of you would ever be married. You would be a set of unfortunate bachelors. Not, however, that that would alter you much.
<p/>Nowadays all the married men live like bachelors, and all the bachelors like married men. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>'' Fin de siecle ,'' murmured Lord Henry.
<p/>'' Fin du globe ,'' answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hostess. '' I wish it were fin du globe ,'' said Dorian with a sigh.
<p/>'' Life is a great disappointment.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah, my dear,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div>cried Lady Narborough, putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Narborough</b></font>) gloves, <div class="bookquote">``don't tell me that you have exhausted life.
<p/>Lord Henry is very wicked, and I sometimes wish that I had been; but you are made to be good--you look so good.
<p/>When a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I must find you a nice wife. Lord Henry, don't you think that Mr. Gray should get married?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lady Narborough/Narborough</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am always telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) so, Lady Narborough,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry with a bow. '' Well, we must look out for a suitable match for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>I shall go through Debrett carefully to-night and draw out a list of all the eligible young ladies. '' <div class="bookquote">``With their ages, Lady Narborough?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>asked Dorian.
<p/>I want it to be what The Morning Post calls a suitable alliance, and I want you both to be happy.
<p/>'' Of course, with their ages, slightly edited. But nothing must be done in a hurry. '' '' What nonsense people talk about happy marriages!'' exclaimed Lord Henry.
<p/>'' A man can be happy with any woman, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) does not love her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! what a cynic you are!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the old lady, pushing back her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chair and nodding to Lady Ruxton. '' You must come and dine with me soon again.
<p/>You are really an admirable tonic, much better than what Sir Andrew prescribes for me. You must tell me what people you would like to meet, though.
<p/>I want it to be a delightful gathering. '' '' I like men who have a future and women who have a past,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Andrew</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' Or do you think that would make it a petticoat party?'' <div class="bookquote">``I fear so,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, laughing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) stood up.
<p/>'' A thousand pardons, my dear Lady Ruxton,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruxton</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I didn't see you hadn't finished your cigarette. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind, Lady Narborough.
<p/>I smoke a great deal too much. I am going to limit myself, for the future. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pray don't, Lady Ruxton,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry.
<p/>'' Moderation is a fatal thing. Enough is as bad as a meal. More than enough is as good as a feast.
<p/>'' Lady Ruxton glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) curiously. '' You must come and explain that to me some afternoon, Lord Henry. It sounds a fascinating theory,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruxton</b></font>) murmured, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ruxton</b></font>) swept out of the room.
<p/>'' Now, mind you don't stay too long over your politics and scandal,'' cried Lady Narborough from the door. '' If you do, we are sure to squabble upstairs.
<p/>The men laughed, and Mr. Chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the table and came up to the top.
<p/>'' Dorian Gray changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) seat and went and sat by Lord Henry. Mr. Chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the situation in the House of Commons.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) guffawed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) adversaries. The word doctrinaire --word full of terror to the British mind--reappeared from time to time between his (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) explosions.
<p/>The inherited stupidity of the race--sound English common sense he (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) jovially termed it--was shown to be the proper bulwark for society.
<p/>An alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory. He (<font color='blue'><b>Chapman</b></font>) hoisted the Union Jack on the pinnacles of thought. A smile curved Lord Henry's lips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) turned round and looked at Dorian.
<p/>'' Are you better, my dear fellow?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) asked. '' You seemed rather out of sorts at dinner.'' '' I am quite well, Harry.
<p/>I am tired. That is all.'' '' You were charming last night. The little duchess is quite devoted to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) tells me she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) is going down to Selby.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) has promised to come on the twentieth.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Is Monmouth to be there, too?''  (<font color='red'><b>Harry</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, yes, Harry.'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bores me dreadfully, almost as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bores her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) is very clever, too clever for a woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) lacks the indefinable charm of weakness. It is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) feet are very pretty, but they are not feet of clay. White porcelain feet, if you like. They have been through the fire, and what fire does not destroy, it hardens.
<p/>I believe, according to the peerage, it is ten years, but ten years with Monmouth must have been like eternity, with time thrown in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) has had experiences. '' <div class="bookquote">``How long has she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) been married?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>asked Dorian. '' An eternity, she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) tells me. Who else is coming?''
<p/>'' Oh, the Willoughbys, Lord Rugby and his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) wife, our hostess, Geoffrey Clouston, the usual set. I have asked Lord Grotrian.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. '' A great many people don't, but I find him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) charming.

<p/>'' No, Harry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said at last, <div class="bookquote">``I did not get home till nearly three.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you go to the club?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) answered. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) lip. '' No, I don't mean that. I didn't go to the club.
<p/>I walked about. I forget what I did.... How inquisitive you are, Harry! You always want to know what one has been doing.
<p/>I always want to forget what I have been doing. I came in at half-past two, if you wish to know the exact time.
<p/>I had left my latch-key at home, and my servant had to let me in. If you want any corroborative evidence on the subject, you can ask him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>).''
<p/>Lord Henry shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shoulders. '' My dear fellow, as if I cared! Let us go up to the drawing-room. No sherry, thank you, Mr. Chapman.
<p/>Something has happened to you, Dorian. Tell me what it is. You are not yourself to-night.'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't mind me, Harry. I am irritable, and out of temper.
<p/>I shall come round and see you to-morrow, or next day. Make my excuses to Lady Narborough. I shan't go upstairs.
<p/>I shall go home. I must go home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>'' All right, Dorian. I dare say I shall see you to-morrow at tea-time.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) drove back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) own house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was conscious that the sense of terror he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) had strangled had come back to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).
<p/>The duchess is coming. '' <div class="bookquote">``I will try to be there, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, leaving the room. Lord Henry's casual questioning had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lose his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nerve for the moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) wanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nerve still.
<p/>Things that were dangerous had to be destroyed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) winced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hated the idea of even touching them. Yet it had to be done.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) realized that, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had locked the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) library, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) opened the secret press into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had thrust Basil Hallward's coat and bag.
<p/>A huge fire was blazing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) piled another log on it. The smell of the singeing clothes and burning leather was horrible.
<p/>At the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt faint and sick, and having lit some Algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) bathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) hands and forehead with a cool musk-scented vinegar.
<p/>It took him (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) three-quarters of an hour to consume everything. Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) started. His (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) eyes grew strangely bright, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) gnawed nervously at his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) underlip.
<p/>Between two of the windows stood a large Florentine cabinet, made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid, as though it held something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) longed for and yet almost loathed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) breath quickened. A mad craving came over him (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) lit a cigarette and then threw it away. His (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) got up from the sofa on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) had been lying, went over to it, and having unlocked it, touched some hidden spring.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) still watched the cabinet. A triangular drawer passed slowly out. His (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) fingers moved instinctively towards it, dipped in, and closed on something.
<p/>It was a small Chinese box of black and gold-dust lacquer, elaborately wrought, the sides patterned with curved waves, and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) opened it. Inside was a green paste, waxy in lustre, the odour curiously heavy and persistent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) hesitated for some moments, with a strangely immobile smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) face.
<p/>Then shivering, though the atmosphere of the room was terribly hot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Algerian</b></font>) drew himself up and glanced at the clock. It was twenty minutes to twelve.
<p/>As midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air, Dorian Gray, dressed commonly, and with a muffler wrapped round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) throat, crept quietly out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) house.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) put the box back, shutting the cabinet doors as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) did so, and went into his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) bedroom. In Bond Street he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) found a hansom with a good horse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address. The man shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head. '' It is too far for me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) muttered.
<p/>All right, sir,'' answered the man, <div class="bookquote">``you will be there in an hour,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>and after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fare had got in he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse round and drove rapidly towards the river.
<p/>'' Here is a sovereign for you,'' said Dorian. '' You shall have another if you drive fast.'' '' CHAPTER 16
<p/>A cold rain began to fall, and the blurred street-lamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist. The public-houses were just closing, and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors.
<p/>Lying back in the hansom, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hat pulled over his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) forehead, Dorian Gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city, and now and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) repeated to himself the words that Lord Henry had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) on the first day they had met, <div class="bookquote">``To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul.
<p/>From some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter. In others, drunkards brawled and screamed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Yes, that was the secret.
<p/>There were opium dens where one could buy oblivion, dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had often tried it, and would try it again now. The moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull.
<p/>From time to time a huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it. The gas-lamps grew fewer, and the streets more narrow and gloomy.
<p/>Once the man lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way and had to drive back half a mile. A steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles.
<p/>The sidewindows of the hansom were clogged with a grey-flannel mist. '' To cure the soul by means of the senses, and the senses by means of the soul!
<p/>'' How the words rang in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ears! His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soul, certainly, was sick to death. Was it true that the senses could cure it?
<p/>for that there was no atonement; but though forgiveness was impossible, forgetfulness was possible still, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was determined to forget, to stamp the thing out, to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one.
<p/>Innocent blood had been spilled. What could atone for that? Ah! Indeed, what right had Basil to have spoken to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had done?
<p/>Who had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) a judge over others? He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had said things that were dreadful, horrible, not to be endured. On and on plodded the hansom, going slower, it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>), at each step.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster. The hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) throat burned and his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) delicate hands twitched nervously together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) struck at the horse madly with his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) stick. The driver laughed and whipped up.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) laughed in answer, and the man was silent. The way seemed interminable, and the streets like the black web of some sprawling spider.
<p/>The monotony became unbearable, and as the mist thickened, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt afraid. Then they passed by lonely brickfields. The fog was lighter here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could see the strange, bottle-shaped kilns with their orange, fanlike tongues of fire.
<p/>A dog barked as they went by, and far away in the darkness some wandering sea-gull screamed. The horse stumbled in a rut, then swerved aside and broke into a gallop.
<p/>After some time they left the clay road and rattled again over rough-paven streets. Most of the windows were dark, but now and then fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched them curiously. They moved like monstrous marionettes and made gestures like live things. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hated them. A dull rage was in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart.
<p/>As they turned a corner, a woman yelled something at them from an open door, and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards.
<p/>Certainly with hideous iteration the bitten lips of Dorian Gray shaped and reshaped those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had found in them the full expression, as it were, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) mood, and justified, by intellectual approval, passions that without such justification would still have dominated his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) temper.
<p/>From cell to cell of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) brain crept the one thought; and the wild desire to live, most terrible of all man's appetites, quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre.
<p/>Ugliness that had once been hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) because it made things real, became dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now for that very reason.
<p/>The driver beat at them with his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) whip. It is said that passion makes one think in a circle. Ugliness was the one reality.
<p/>The coarse brawl, the loathsome den, the crude violence of disordered life, the very vileness of thief and outcast, were more vivid, in their intense actuality of impression, than all the gracious shapes of art, the dreamy shadows of song.
<p/>They were what he (<font color='blue'><b>outcast</b></font>) needed for forgetfulness. In three days he (<font color='blue'><b>outcast</b></font>) would be free. Suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane.
<p/>Over the low roofs and jagged chimney-stacks of the houses rose the black masts of ships. Wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the yards.
<p/>This will do,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) had promised him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) walked quickly in the direction of the quay.
<p/>'' Somewhere about here, sir, ain't it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) asked huskily through the trap. Dorian started and peered round. '' Here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman.
<p/>The light shook and splintered in the puddles. A red glare came from an outward-bound steamer that was coaling. The slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hurried on towards the left, glancing back now and then to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was being followed. In about seven or eight minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) reached a small shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories.
<p/>In one of the top-windows stood a lamp. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) stopped and gave a peculiar knock. After a little time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heard steps in the passage and the chain being unhooked.
<p/>The door opened quietly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) went in without saying a word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) passed.
<p/>At the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) in from the street.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as if it had once been a third-rate dancing-saloon.
<p/>Shrill flaring gas-jets, dulled and distorted in the fly-blown mirrors that faced them, were ranged round the walls. Greasy reflectors of ribbed tin backed them, making quivering disks of light.
<p/>The floor was covered with ochre-coloured sawdust, trampled here and there into mud, and stained with dark rings of spilled liquor.
<p/>Some Malays were crouching by a little charcoal stove, playing with bone counters and showing their white teeth as they chattered.
<p/>In one corner, with his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) head buried in his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) arms, a sailor sprawled over a table, and by the tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women, mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat with an expression of disgust.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s got red ants on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),'' laughed one of them, as Dorian passed by. The man looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in terror and began to whimper.
<p/>At the end of the room there was a little staircase, leading to a darkened chamber. As Dorian hurried up its three rickety steps, the heavy odour of opium met him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) entered, a young man with smooth yellow hair, who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe, looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and nodded in a hesitating manner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heaved a deep breath, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nostrils quivered with pleasure. '' You here, Adrian? '' muttered Dorian. '' Where else should I be?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered, listlessly. '' None of the chaps will speak to me now. '' <div class="bookquote">``I thought you had left England.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Darlington is not going to do anything. My brother paid the bill at last. George doesn't speak to me either....
<p/>I don't care,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) added with a sigh. '' As long as one has this stuff, one doesn't want friends. I think I have had too many friends.
<p/>'' Dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses. The twisted limbs, the gaping mouths, the staring lustreless eyes, fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) knew in what strange heavens they were suffering, and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy.
<p/>They were better off than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was prisoned in thought. Memory, like a horrible malady, was eating his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) soul away.
<p/>From time to time he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) seemed to see the eyes of Basil Hallward looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>). Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) could not stay.
<p/>The presence of Adrian Singleton troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) wanted to be where no one would know who he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) was. He (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) wanted to escape from himself.
<p/>'' I am going on to the other place,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) said after a pause. '' On the wharf?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That mad-cat is sure to be there.
<p/>They won't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) in this place now. '' Dorian shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) shoulders. '' I am sick of women who love one.
<p/>Women who hate one are much more interesting. Besides, the stuff is better. '' <div class="bookquote">``Much the same. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I like it better.
<p/>Come and have something to drink. I must have something. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I don't want anything,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>murmured the young man. '' Never mind.
<p/>A half-caste, in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster, grinned a hideous greeting as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of them.
<p/>'' Adrian Singleton rose up wearily and followed Dorian to the bar. The women sidled up and began to chatter. Dorian turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) back on them and said something in a low voice to Adrian Singleton.
<p/>A crooked smile, like a Malay crease, writhed across the face of one of the women. '' We are very proud to-night,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sneered.
<p/>'' For God's sake don't talk to me,'' cried Dorian, stamping his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) foot on the ground. '' What do you want?
<p/>Two red sparks flashed for a moment in the woman's sodden eyes, then flickered out and left them dull and glazed.
<p/>Money? Here it is. Don't ever talk to me again. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tossed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head and raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) companion watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) enviously. '' It's no use,'' sighed Adrian Singleton. '' I don't care to go back. What does it matter?
<p/>I am quite happy here. '' <div class="bookquote">``You will write to me if you want anything, won't you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, after a pause.
<p/>'' Perhaps. '' <div class="bookquote">``Good night, then.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good night,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>answered the young man, passing up the steps and wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) parched mouth with a handkerchief.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) drew the curtain aside, a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the woman who had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money.
<p/>Dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) face. '' There goes the devil's bargain! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hiccoughed, in a hoarse voice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Curse you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``don't call me that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) snapped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fingers. '' Prince Charming is what you like to be called, ain't it?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) yelled after him (<font color='blue'><b>Charming</b></font>). The drowsy sailor leaped to his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) feet as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke, and looked wildly round. The sound of the shutting of the hall door fell on his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) ear.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) meeting with Adrian Singleton had strangely moved him (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) door, as Basil Hallward had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) with such infamy of insult.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Singleton</b></font>) rushed out as if in pursuit. Dorian Gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lip, and for a few seconds his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes grew sad.
<p/>Yet, after all, what did it matter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>)? One's days were too brief to take the burden of another's errors on one's shoulders.
<p/>Each man lived his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own life and paid his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own price for living it. The only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault.
<p/>There are moments, psychologists tell us, when the passion for sin, or for what the world calls sin, so dominates a nature that every fibre of the body, as every cell of the brain, seems to be instinct with fearful impulses.
<p/>One had to pay over and over again, indeed. In her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) dealings with man, destiny never closed her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) accounts. Men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will.
<p/>Choice is taken from them, and conscience is either killed, or, if it lives at all, lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm.
<p/>They move to their terrible end as automatons move. For all sins, as theologians weary not of reminding us, are sins of disobedience.
<p/>Callous, concentrated on evil, with stained mind, and soul hungry for rebellion, Dorian Gray hastened on, quickening his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) step as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) went, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) darted aside into a dim archway, that had served him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) often as a short cut to the ill-famed place where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was going, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt himself suddenly seized from behind, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had time to defend himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was thrust back against the wall, with a brutal hand round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) throat.
<p/>When that high spirit, that morning star of evil, fell from heaven, it was as a rebel that he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) fell. He (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) struggled madly for life, and by a terrible effort wrenched the tightening fingers away.
<p/>In a second he (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) heard the click of a revolver, and saw the gleam of a polished barrel, pointing straight at his (<font color='blue'><b>rebel</b></font>) head, and the dusky form of a short, thick-set man facing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>'' What do you want? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gasped. '' Keep quiet,'' said the man. '' If you stir, I shoot you.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are mad. What have I done to you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)</div>'' You wrecked the life of Sibyl Vane,'' was the answer, <div class="bookquote">``and Sibyl Vane was my sister.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) killed herself. I know it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) death is at your door. I swore I would kill you in return. For years I have sought you.
<p/>I had no clue, no trace. The two people who could have described you were dead. I knew nothing of you but the pet name she (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) used to call you.
<p/>I heard it to-night by chance. Make your peace with God, for to-night you are going to die. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Sibyl</b></font>)</div>Dorian Gray grew sick with fear.
<p/>'' I never knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stammered. '' I never heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>). You are mad.'' <div class="bookquote">``You had better confess your sin, for as sure as I am James Vane, you are going to die.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was a horrible moment. Dorian did not know what to say or do. '' Down on your knees!'' growled the man.
<p/>'' I give you one minute to make your peace--no more. I go on board to-night for India, and I must do my job first.
<p/>One minute. That's all. '' Dorian's arms fell to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) side. Paralysed with terror, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) did not know what to do.
<p/>Suddenly a wild hope flashed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) brain. <div class="bookquote">``Stop,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) cried. '' How long ago is it since your sister died?
<p/>Quick, tell me!'' <div class="bookquote">``Eighteen years,''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the man. '' Why do you ask me? What do years matter? '' <div class="bookquote">``Eighteen years,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>laughed Dorian Gray, with a touch of triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' Eighteen years! Set me under the lamp and look at my face!'' James Vane hesitated for a moment, not understanding what was meant.
<p/>Dim and wavering as was the wind-blown light, yet it served to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) the hideous error, as it seemed, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) had fallen, for the face of the man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had sought to kill
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seized Dorian Gray and dragged him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from the archway. had all the bloom of boyhood, all the unstained purity of youth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed little more than a lad of twenty summers, hardly older, if older indeed at all, than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister had been when they had parted so many years ago.
<p/>It was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hold and reeled back.
<p/>'' My God! my God!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">``and I would have murdered you!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dorian Gray drew a long breath. '' You have been on the brink of committing a terrible crime, my man,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sternly.
<p/>'' Let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hands.'' <div class="bookquote">``Forgive me, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>James Vane/James</b></font>)</div>muttered James Vane.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You had better go home and put that pistol away, or you may get into trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, turning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heel and going slowly down the street.
<p/>'' I was deceived. A chance word I heard in that damned den set me on the wrong track.'' James Vane stood on the pavement in horror.
<p/>After a little while, a black shadow that had been creeping along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) with stealthy footsteps.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was trembling from head to foot. He (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) felt a hand laid on his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) arm and looked round with a start.
<p/>It was one of the women who had been drinking at the bar. '' Why didn't you kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>)? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) hissed out, putting haggard face quite close to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>).
<p/>'' I knew you were following him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) when you rushed out from Daly's. You fool! You should have killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Daly</b></font>).

<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Daly</b></font>) is not the man I am looking for,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``and I want no man's money. I want a man's life.
<p/>The man whose life I want must be nearly forty now. This one is little more than a boy. Thank God, I have not got his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) blood upon my hands.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The woman gave a bitter laugh. '' Little more than a boy! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sneered. '' Why, man, it's nigh on eighteen years since Prince Charming made me what I am.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You lie!''  (<font color='red'><b>James Vane/James</b></font>)</div>cried James Vane. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand up to heaven. '' Before God I am telling the truth,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' Before God?'' '' Strike me dumb if it ain't so. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is the worst one that comes here. They say he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face.
<p/>It's nigh on eighteen years since I met him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) hasn't changed much since then. I have, though,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, with a sickly leer.
<p/>'' You swear this?'' <div class="bookquote">``I swear it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>came in hoarse echo from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) flat mouth. '' But don't give me away to him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>),'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whined; <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>).
<p/>Let me have some money for my night's lodging. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) broke from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with an oath and rushed to the corner of the street, but Dorian Gray had disappeared.
<p/>A week later Dorian Gray was sitting in the conservatory at Selby Royal, talking to the pretty Duchess of Monmouth, who with her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) husband, a jaded-looking man of sixty, was amongst his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guests.
<p/>It was tea-time, and the mellow light of the huge, lace-covered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) white hands were moving daintily among the cups, and her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) full red lips were smiling at something that Dorian had whispered to her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>).
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) looked back, the woman had vanished also. CHAPTER 17 Lord Henry was lying back in a silk-draped wicker chair, looking at them.
<p/>Lady Narborough, pretending to listen to the duke's description of the last Brazilian beetle that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) collection.
<p/>On a peach-coloured divan sat Three young men in elaborate smoking-suits were handing tea-cakes to some of the women. The house-party consisted of twelve people, and there were more expected to arrive on the next day.
<p/>'' What are you two talking about?'' said Lord Henry, strolling over to the table and putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cup down. ''
<p/>I hope Dorian has told you about my plan for rechristening everything, Gladys. It is a delightful idea.'' '' But I don't want to be rechristened, Harry,'' rejoined the duchess, looking up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) wonderful eyes.
<p/>'' I am quite satisfied with my own name, and I am sure Mr. Gray should be satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).'' ''
<p/>My dear Gladys, I would not alter either name for the world. They are both perfect. I was thinking chiefly of flowers.
<p/>Yesterday I cut an orchid, for my button-hole. It was a marvellous spotted thing, as effective as the seven deadly sins.
<p/>In a thoughtless moment I asked one of the gardeners what it was called. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) told me it was a fine specimen of Robinsoniana , or something dreadful of that kind.
<p/>It is a sad truth, but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things. Names are everything. I never quarrel with actions.
<p/>My one quarrel is with words. That is the reason I hate vulgar realism in literature. The man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one.
<p/>It is the only thing he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is fit for.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then what should we call you, Harry? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) asked. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) name is Prince Paradox,'' said Dorian.
<p/>'' I recognize him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) in a flash,'' exclaimed the duchess. '' I won't hear of it,'' laughed Lord Henry, sinking into a chair.
<p/>'' From a label there is no escape! I refuse the title.'' <div class="bookquote">``Royalties may not abdicate,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>fell as a warning from pretty lips.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I prefer the mistakes of to-day,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) answered.
<p/>'' You disarm me, Gladys,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cried, catching the wilfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) mood. '' Of your shield, Harry, not of your spear.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I never tilt against beauty,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) said, with a wave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand. '' That is your error, Harry, believe me.
<p/>You value beauty far too much.'' <div class="bookquote">``How can you say that? I admit that I think that it is better to be beautiful than to be good.
<p/>But on the other hand, no one is more ready than I am to acknowledge that it is better to be good than to be ugly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Ugliness is one of the seven deadly sins, then?'' cried the duchess. '' What becomes of your simile about the orchid?''
<p/>'' Ugliness is one of the seven deadly virtues, Gladys. You, as a good Tory, must not underrate them. Beer, the Bible, and the seven deadly virtues have made our England what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) is.

<p/>Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) made it out of nothing. All good hats are made out of nothing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Like all good reputations, Gladys,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lord Henry.
<p/>'' Every effect that one produces gives one an enemy. To be popular one must be a mediocrity.

<p/>Ah! then, you never really love, Mr. Gray,'' answered the duchess with mock sadness. '' My dear Gladys!'' cried Lord Henry.
<p/>'' How can you say that? Romance lives by repetition, and repetition converts an appetite into an art. Besides, each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved.
<p/>We can have in life but one great experience at best, and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible.''

<p/>'' What do you say to that, Mr. Gray? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) inquired. Dorian hesitated for a moment. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head back and laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Women are not always allowed a choice,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) answered, but hardly had he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan, followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall.
<p/>And with fear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) eyes, Lord Henry rushed through the flapping palms to find Dorian Gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon.
<p/>Everybody started up. The duchess stood motionless in horror. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was carried at once into the blue drawing-room and laid upon one of the sofas.
<p/>After a short time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) came to himself and looked round with a dazed expression. '' What has happened? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) asked.
<p/>'' Oh! I remember. Am I safe here, Harry?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) began to tremble. '' My dear Dorian,'' answered Lord Henry, <div class="bookquote">``you merely fainted.
<p/>That was all. You must have overtired yourself. You had better not come down to dinner. I will take your place.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, I will come down,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, struggling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) feet. '' I would rather come down. I must not be alone.
<p/>There was a wild recklessness of gaiety in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sat at table, but now and then a thrill of terror ran through him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remembered that, pressed against the window of the conservatory, like a white handkerchief, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had seen the face of James Vane watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>).
<p/>The next day he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) did not leave the house, and, indeed, spent most of the time in his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) own room, sick with a wild terror of dying, and yet indifferent to life itself.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) went to his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) room and dressed. CHAPTER 18 The consciousness of being hunted, snared, tracked down, had begun to dominate him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>).
<p/>The dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) like his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) own wasted resolutions and wild regrets.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) saw again the sailor's face peering through the mist-stained glass, and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) heart.
<p/>But perhaps it had been only his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>).
<p/>If the tapestry did but tremble in the wind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) shook. Actual life was chaos, but there was something terribly logical in the imagination.
<p/>It was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin. It was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood.
<p/>In the common world of fact the wicked were not punished, nor the good rewarded. Success was given to the strong, failure thrust upon the weak.
<p/>That was all. Besides, had any stranger been prowling round the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) would have been seen by the servants or the keepers.
<p/>Had any foot-marks been found on the flower-beds, the gardeners would have reported it. Yes, it had been merely fancy. Sibyl Vane's brother had not come back to kill him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had sailed away in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ship to founder in some winter sea. From him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), at any rate, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was safe.
<p/>Why, the man did not know who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, could not know who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was. The mask of youth had saved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>And yet if it had been merely an illusion, how terrible it was to think that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms, and give them visible form, and make them move before one!
<p/>What sort of life would his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be if, day and night, shadows of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crime were to peer at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from silent corners, to mock him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from secret places, to whisper in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ear as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sat at the feast, to wake him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with icy fingers as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay asleep!
<p/>As the thought crept through his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brain, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grew pale with terror, and the air seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to have become suddenly colder.
<p/>Oh! in what a wild hour of madness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had killed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend! How ghastly the mere memory of the scene!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw it all again. Each hideous detail came back to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with added horror. Out of the black cave of time, terrible and swathed in scarlet, rose the image of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sin.
<p/>When Lord Henry came in at six o'clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) crying as one whose heart will break. It was not till the third day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ventured to go out.
<p/>There was something in the clear, pine-scented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) back his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) joyousness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ardour for life.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm.
<p/>But it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused the change. With subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so.
<p/>Their strong passions must either bruise or bend. They either slay the man, or themselves die. Shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on.
<p/>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had convinced himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been the victim of a terror-stricken imagination, and looked back now on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fears with something of pity and not a little of contempt.
<p/>After breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden and then drove across the park to join the shooting-party.
<p/>The loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude. The crisp frost lay like salt upon the grass.
<p/>At the corner of the pine-wood he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) caught sight of Sir Geoffrey Clouston, the duchess's brother, jerking two spent cartridges out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Clouston</b></font>) gun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clouston</b></font>) jumped from the cart, and having told the groom to take the mare home, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Clouston</b></font>) way towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Clouston</b></font>) guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth.
<p/>The sky was an inverted cup of blue metal. A thin film of ice bordered the flat, reed-grown lake. '' Have you had good sport, Geoffrey?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) asked. '' Not very good, Dorian. I think most of the birds have gone to the open. I dare say it will be better after lunch, when we get to new ground.
<p/>The keen aromatic air, the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood, the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time, and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed, fascinated him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) and filled him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) with a sense of delightful freedom.
<p/>'' Dorian strolled along by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was dominated by the carelessness of happiness, by the high indifference of joy.
<p/>Suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them, with black-tipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward, started a hare.
<p/>Sir Geoffrey put his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) gun to his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) shoulder, but there was something in the animal's grace of movement that strangely charmed Dorian Gray, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cried out at once, <div class="bookquote">``Don't shoot it, Geoffrey.
<p/>It bolted for a thicket of alders. Let it live. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What nonsense, Dorian!'' laughed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) companion, and as the hare bounded into the thicket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) fired.
<p/>There were two cries heard, the cry of a hare in pain, which is dreadful, the cry of a man in agony, which is worse.
<p/>'' Good heavens! I have hit a beater!'' exclaimed Sir Geoffrey. '' What an ass the man was to get in front of the guns!
<p/>Stop shooting there! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) called out at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice. '' A man is hurt. '' The head-keeper came running up with a stick in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' Where, sir? Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shouted. At the same time, the firing ceased along the line. '' Here,'' answered Sir Geoffrey angrily, hurrying towards the thicket.
<p/>'' Why on earth don't you keep your men back? Spoiled my shooting for the day. '' Dorian watched them as they plunged into the alder-clump, brushing the lithe swinging branches aside.
<p/>In a few moments they emerged, dragging a body after them into the sunlight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) turned away in horror. It seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) that misfortune followed wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) went.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) heard Sir Geoffrey ask if the man was really dead, and the affirmative answer of the keeper. The wood seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) to have become suddenly alive with faces.
<p/>There was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of voices. A great copper-breasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead.
<p/>After a few moments--that were to him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) perturbed state, like endless hours of pain--he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) felt a hand laid on his (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) started and looked round. '' Dorian,'' said Lord Henry, <div class="bookquote">``I had better tell them that the shooting is stopped for to-day.
<p/>It would not look well to go on.''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wish it were stopped for ever, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) answered bitterly. '' The whole thing is hideous and cruel.
<p/>Is the man ...? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not finish the sentence. '' I am afraid so,'' rejoined Lord Henry. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) got the whole charge of shot in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must have died almost instantaneously. Come; let us go home. '' They walked side by side in the direction of the avenue for nearly fifty yards without speaking.
<p/>Then Dorian looked at Lord Henry and said, with a heavy sigh, <div class="bookquote">``It is a bad omen, Harry, a very bad omen.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>'' What is?'' asked Lord Henry. '' Oh! this accident, I suppose. My dear fellow, it can't be helped. It was the man's own fault.
<p/>Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) get in front of the guns? Besides, it is nothing to us. It is rather awkward for Geoffrey, of course.
<p/>It does not do to pepper beaters. It makes people think that one is a wild shot. And Geoffrey is not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) shoots very straight.
<p/>But there is no use talking about the matter. '' Dorian shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) head. '' It is a bad omen, Harry.
<p/>I feel as if something horrible were going to happen to some of us. To myself, perhaps,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) added, passing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hand over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes, with a gesture of pain.
<p/>The elder man laughed. '' The only horrible thing in the world is ennui , Dorian. That is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness.
<p/>But we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner. I must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed.
<p/>As for omens, there is no such thing as an omen. Destiny does not send us heralds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) is too wise or too cruel for that.
<p/>Besides, what on earth could happen to you, Dorian? You have everything in the world that a man can want. There is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you.''
<p/>'' There is no one with whom I would not change places, Harry. Don't laugh like that. I am telling you the truth.
<p/>The wretched peasant who has just died is better off than I am. I have no terror of death. It is the coming of death that terrifies me.
<p/>Its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me. Good heavens! don't you see a man moving behind the trees there, watching me, waiting for me?''
<p/>Lord Henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand was pointing. '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``I see the gardener waiting for you.
<p/>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table to-night. How absurdly nervous you are, my dear fellow!
<p/>You must come and see my doctor, when we get back to town. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) saw the gardener approaching.
<p/>The man touched his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat, glanced for a moment at Lord Henry in a hesitating manner, and then produced a letter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) handed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) master.
<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) Grace told me to wait for an answer,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) murmured. Dorian put the letter into his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) pocket. <div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) Grace that I am coming in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said, coldly.
<p/>The man turned round and went rapidly in the direction of the house. '' How fond women are of doing dangerous things!'' laughed Lord Henry.
<p/>'' It is one of the qualities in them that I admire most. A woman will flirt with anybody in the world as long as other people are looking on.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How fond you are of saying dangerous things, Harry! In the present instance, you are quite astray. I like the duchess very much, but I don't love her (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And the duchess loves you very much, but she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) likes you less, so you are excellently matched.'' '' You are talking scandal, Harry, and there is never any basis for scandal.''
<p/>'' The basis of every scandal is an immoral certainty,'' said Lord Henry, lighting a cigarette. '' You would sacrifice anybody, Harry, for the sake of an epigram.''
<p/>'' The world goes to the altar of its own accord,'' was the answer. '' I wish I could love,'' cried Dorian Gray with a deep note of pathos in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' But I seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire. I am too much concentrated on myself. My own personality has become a burden to me.
<p/>I want to escape, to go away, to forget. It was silly of me to come down here at all. I think I shall send a wire to Harvey to have the yacht got ready.
<p/>On a yacht one is safe.'' '' Safe from what, Dorian? You are in some trouble. Why not tell me what it is?
<p/>You know I would help you.'' <div class="bookquote">``I can't tell you, Harry,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) answered sadly. '' And I dare say it is only a fancy of mine.
<p/>This unfortunate accident has upset me. I have a horrible presentiment that something of the kind may happen to me. ''
<p/>'' What nonsense!'' <div class="bookquote">``I hope it is, but I can't help feeling it. Ah! here is the duchess, looking like Artemis in a tailor-made gown.
<p/>You see we have come back, Duchess.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have heard all about it, Mr. Gray,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) answered. '' Poor Geoffrey is terribly upset.
<p/>And it seems that you asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) not to shoot the hare. How curious!'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, it was very curious. I don't know what made me say it.
<p/>Some whim, I suppose. It looked the loveliest of little live things. But I am sorry they told you about the man.
<p/>It is a hideous subject.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is an annoying subject,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>broke in Lord Henry. '' It has no psychological value at all.
<p/>Now if Geoffrey had done the thing on purpose, how interesting he (<font color='blue'><b>Geoffrey</b></font>) would be! I should like to know some one who had committed a real murder.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How horrid of you, Harry!''  (<font color='red'><b>the duchess</b></font>)</div>cried the duchess. <div class="bookquote">``Isn't it, Mr. Gray? Harry, Mr. Gray is ill again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) is going to faint.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>Dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled. '' It is nothing, Duchess,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured; <div class="bookquote">``my nerves are dreadfully out of order.
<p/>That is all. I am afraid I walked too far this morning. I didn't hear what Harry said. Was it very bad?
<p/>You must tell me some other time. I think I must go and lie down. You will excuse me, won't you?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>They had reached the great flight of steps that led from the conservatory on to the terrace. As the glass door closed behind Dorian, Lord Henry turned and looked at the duchess with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) slumberous eyes.
<p/>'' Are you very much in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) did not answer for some time, but stood gazing at the landscape.
<p/>'' I wish I knew,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) said at last. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) head. '' Knowledge would be fatal. It is the uncertainty that charms one.
<p/>A mist makes things wonderful.'' '' One may lose one's way.'' '' All ways end at the same point, my dear Gladys.
<p/>'' '' What is that? '' <div class="bookquote">``Disillusion.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was my debut in life,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) sighed. '' It came to you crowned.

''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You would miss them,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry.
<p/>'' I will not part with a petal. '' <div class="bookquote">``Monmouth has ears.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Old age is dull of hearing.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) never been jealous?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) glanced about as if in search of something. '' What are you looking for?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) inquired. '' The button from your foil,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered. '' You have dropped it. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) laughed. '' I have still the mask.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It makes your eyes lovelier,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) laughed again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) teeth showed like white seeds in a scarlet fruit.
<p/>Upstairs, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own room, Dorian Gray was lying on a sofa, with terror in every tingling fibre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) body.
<p/>The dreadful death of the unlucky beater, shot in the thicket like a wild animal, had seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to pre-figure death for himself also.
<p/>Life had suddenly become too hideous a burden for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to bear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had nearly swooned at what Lord Henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting.
<p/>At five o'clock he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rang his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bell for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) servant and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) orders to pack his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) things for the night-express to town, and to have the brougham at the door by eight-thirty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was determined not to sleep another night at Selby Royal. It was an ill-omened place. Death walked there in the sunlight.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) wrote a note to Lord Henry, telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was going up to town to consult his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) doctor and asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to entertain his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) guests in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) absence.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was putting it into the envelope, a knock came to the door, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) valet informed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that the head-keeper wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>The grass of the forest had been spotted with blood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) frowned and bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lip. <div class="bookquote">``Send him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) muttered, after some moments' hesitation.
<p/>drawer and spread it out before him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). '' I suppose you have come about the unfortunate accident of this morning, Thornton?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) said, taking up a pen. '' Yes, sir,'' answered the gamekeeper. '' Was the poor fellow married? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) any people dependent on him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?
<p/>If so, I should not like them to be left in want, and will send them any sum of money you may think necessary.''
<p/>'' asked Dorian, looking bored. '' '' We don't know who he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is, sir. That is what I took the liberty of coming to you about.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't know who he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, listlessly. '' What do you mean? Wasn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) one of your men?'' '' No, sir.
<p/>Never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) before. Seems like a sailor, sir. '' The pen dropped from Dorian Gray's hand, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) felt as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) heart had suddenly stopped beating.
<p/>'' A sailor? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) cried out. '' Did you say a sailor?'' '' Yes, sir. He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) looks as if he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) had been a sort of sailor; tattooed on both arms, and that kind of thing.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was there anything found on him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian, leaning forward and looking at the man with startled eyes. '' Anything that would tell his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) name?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Some money, sir--not much, and a six-shooter. There was no name of any kind. A decent-looking man, sir, but rough-like. A sort of sailor we think.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>Dorian started to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) feet. A terrible hope fluttered past him (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) clutched at it madly. '' Where is the body?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) exclaimed.
<p/>'' Quick! I must see it at once. '' <div class="bookquote">``It is in an empty stable in the Home Farm, sir. The folk don't like to have that sort of thing in their houses.
<p/>They say a corpse brings bad luck. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The Home Farm! Go there at once and meet me. Tell one of the grooms to bring my horse round.
<p/>In less than a quarter of an hour, Dorian Gray was galloping down the long avenue as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) could go.
<p/>No. Never mind. I'll go to the stables myself. It will save time. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The trees seemed to sweep past him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) in spectral procession, and wild shadows to fling themselves across his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) path.
<p/>Once the mare swerved at a white gate-post and nearly threw him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lashed her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) across the neck with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) crop.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) cleft the dusky air like an arrow. The stones flew from her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) hoofs. At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) reached the Home Farm.
<p/>Two men were loitering in the yard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them. In the farthest stable a light was glimmering.
<p/>Something seemed to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that the body was there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hurried to the door and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) hand upon the latch.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) paused for a moment, feeling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was on the brink of a discovery that would either make or mar his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) life.
<p/>On a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thrust the door open and entered. A spotted handkerchief had been placed over the face. A coarse candle, stuck in a bottle, sputtered beside it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not be the hand to take the handkerchief away, and called out to one of the farm-servants to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Dorian Gray shuddered. '' Take that thing off the face. I wish to see it,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) said, clutching at the door-post for support.
<p/>When the farm-servant had done so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) stepped forward. A cry of joy broke from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) lips. The man who had been shot in the thicket was James Vane.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) stood there for some minutes looking at the dead body. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) rode home, his (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) eyes were full of tears, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>) was safe.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``There is no use your telling me that you are going to be good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>cried Lord Henry, dipping his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) white fingers into a red copper bowl filled with rose-water.
<p/>CHAPTER 19 '' You are quite perfect. Pray, don't change. '' Dorian Gray shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head. '' No, Harry, I have done too many dreadful things in my life.

<p/>There are no temptations there. That is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized. Civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to.
<p/>There are only two ways by which man can reach it. One is by being cultured, the other by being corrupt.

<p/>It seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together. For I have a new ideal, Harry. I am going to alter.
<p/>I think I have altered. '' <div class="bookquote">``You have not yet told me what your good action was. Or did you say you had done more than one?

<p/>'' I can tell you, Harry. It is not a story I could tell to any one else. I spared somebody.
<p/>It sounds vain, but you understand what I mean. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was quite beautiful and wonderfully like Sibyl Vane. I think it was that which first attracted me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Vane</b></font>).
<p/>You remember Sibyl, don't you? How long ago that seems! Well, Hetty was not one of our own class, of course.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was simply a girl in a village. But I really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). I am quite sure that I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).
<p/>All during this wonderful May that we have been having, I used to run down and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) two or three times a week.
<p/>Yesterday she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) met me in a little orchard. The apple-blossoms kept tumbling down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) hair, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) was laughing. We were to have gone away together this morning at dawn.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>interrupted Lord Henry.
<p/>Suddenly I determined to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) as flowerlike as I had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>).'' '' But I can finish your idyll for you.
<p/>You gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) good advice and broke her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) heart. That was the beginning of your reformation.'' <div class="bookquote">``Harry, you are horrible! You mustn't say these dreadful things.
<p/>Hetty's heart is not broken. Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) cried and all that. But there is no disgrace upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) can live, like Perdita, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) garden of mint and marigold.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And weep over a faithless Florizel,'' said Lord Henry, laughing, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chair. '' My dear Dorian, you have the most curiously boyish moods.
<p/>Do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own rank? I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman.
<p/>Well, the fact of having met you, and loved you, will teach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to despise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will be wretched.
<p/>From a moral point of view, I cannot say that I think much of your great renunciation. Even as a beginning, it is poor.
<p/>Besides, how do you know that Hetty isn't floating at the present moment in some starlit mill-pond, with lovely water-lilies round her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), like Ophelia?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can't bear this, Harry! You mock at everything, and then suggest the most serious tragedies. I am sorry I told you now.
<p/>As I rode past the farm this morning, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ophelia</b></font>) white face at the window, like a spray of jasmine.
<p/>Don't let us talk about it any more, and don't try to persuade me that the first good action I have done for years, the first little bit of self-sacrifice I have ever known, is really a sort of sin.
<p/>I don't care what you say to me. I know I was right in acting as I did. Poor Hetty! I want to be better.

<p/>My dear boy, they have only been talking about it for six weeks, and the British public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months.
<p/>'' The people are still discussing poor Basil's disappearance. '' '' They have been very fortunate lately, however. They have had my own divorce-case and Alan Campbell's suicide.
<p/>Scotland Yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for Paris by the midnight train on the ninth of November was poor Basil, and the French police declare that Basil never arrived in Paris at all.
<p/>Now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist. I suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he (<font color='blue'><b>artist</b></font>) has been seen in San Francisco.
<p/>It is an odd thing, but every one who disappears is said to be seen at San Francisco. It must be a delightful city, and possess all the attractions of the next world.
<p/>What do you think has happened to Basil?'' asked Dorian, holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) Burgundy against the light and wondering how it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) could discuss the matter so calmly.
<p/>'' '' '' I have not the slightest idea. If Basil chooses to hide himself, it is no business of mine.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) is dead, I don't want to think about him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>). Death is the only thing that ever terrifies me. I hate it.''
<p/>Because,'' said Lord Henry, passing beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nostrils the gilt trellis of an open vinaigrette box, ``one can survive everything nowadays except that.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the younger man wearily. '' Death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away.
<p/>Let us have our coffee in the music-room, Dorian. You must play Chopin to me. The man with whom my wife ran away played Chopin exquisitely.
<p/>Poor Victoria! I was very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). The house is rather lonely without her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Of course, married life is merely a habit, a bad habit.
<p/>But then one regrets the loss even of one's worst habits. Perhaps one regrets them the most. They are such an essential part of one's personality.
<p/>Dorian said nothing, but rose from the table, and passing into the next room, sat down to the piano and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) fingers stray across the white and black ivory of the keys.
<p/>After the coffee had been brought in, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) stopped, and looking over at Lord Henry, said, <div class="bookquote">``Harry, did it ever occur to you that Basil was murdered?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Lord Henry yawned. '' Basil was very popular, and always wore a Waterbury watch. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) have been murdered?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) was not clever enough to have enemies. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had a wonderful genius for painting. But a man can paint like Velasquez and yet be as dull as possible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Velasquez</b></font>) only interested me once, and that was when he (<font color='blue'><b>Velasquez</b></font>) told me, years ago, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Velasquez</b></font>) had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his (<font color='blue'><b>Velasquez</b></font>) art.''
<p/>Basil was really rather dull. <div class="bookquote">``I was very fond of Basil,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian with a note of sadness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) voice.
<p/>'' But don't people say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) was murdered?'' '' Oh, some of the papers do. It does not seem to me to be at all probable.
<p/>I know there are dreadful places in Paris, but Basil was not the sort of man to have gone to them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had no curiosity. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) chief defect. '' <div class="bookquote">``What would you say, Harry, if I told you that I had murdered Basil?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the younger man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intently after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had spoken. '' I would say, my dear fellow, that you were posing for a character that doesn't suit you.
<p/>All crime is vulgar, just as all vulgarity is crime. It is not in you, Dorian, to commit a murder. I am sorry if I hurt your vanity by saying so, but I assure you it is true.
<p/>Crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders. I don't blame them in the smallest degree. I should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us, simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``A method of procuring sensations? Do you think, then, that a man who has once committed a murder could possibly do the same crime again?
<p/>Don't tell me that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often,'' cried Lord Henry, laughing. ''
<p/>That is one of the most important secrets of life. I should fancy, however, that murder is always a mistake. One should never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner.
<p/>I wish I could believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had come to such a really romantic end as you suggest, but I can't.
<p/>But let us pass from poor Basil. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) fell into the Seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal.
<p/>I see him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) lying now on his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) back under those dull-green waters, with the heavy barges floating over him (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) and long weeds catching in his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) hair.
<p/>Yes: I should fancy that was his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) end. Do you know, I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) would have done much more good work.
<p/>Dorian heaved a sigh, and Lord Henry strolled across the room and began to stroke the head of a curious Java parrot, a large, grey-plumaged bird with pink crest and tail, that was balancing itself upon a bamboo perch.
<p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pointed fingers touched it, it dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black, glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards and forwards.
<p/>During the last ten years his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) painting had gone off very much. '' '' Yes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) continued, turning round and taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) handkerchief out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pocket; <div class="bookquote">``his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) painting had quite gone off.
<p/>It seemed to me to have lost something. It had lost an ideal. When you and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ceased to be great friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) ceased to be a great artist.
<p/>What was it separated you? I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) bored you. If so, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) never forgave you. It's a habit bores have.
<p/>By the way, what has become of that wonderful portrait he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did of you? I don't think I have ever seen it since he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) finished it.
<p/>I remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to Selby, and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way.
<p/>Oh! You never got it back? What a pity! it was really a masterpiece. I remember I wanted to buy it.
<p/>Since then, his (<font color='blue'><b>Selby</b></font>) work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative British artist.
<p/>I wish I had now. It belonged to Basil's best period. Did you advertise for it? You should. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I forget,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian.
<p/>'' I suppose I did. But I never really liked it. I am sorry I sat for it. The memory of the thing is hateful to me.
<p/>Why do you talk of it? It used to remind me of those curious lines in some play-- Hamlet, I think--how do they run?-- <div class="bookquote">``Like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes: that is what it was like. '' Lord Henry laughed. '' If a man treats life artistically, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brain is his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heart,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) answered, sinking into an arm-chair.
<p/>Dorian Gray shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) head and struck some soft chords on the piano. '' `Like the painting of a sorrow,''' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) repeated, '''a face without a heart.'
<p/>By the way, Dorian,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) said after a pause, ''`what does it profit a man if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gain the whole world and lose--how does the quotation run?--his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own soul'?
<p/>'' The elder man lay back and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with half-closed eyes. '' '' The music jarred, and Dorian Gray started and stared at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) friend.
<p/>My dear fellow,'' said Lord Henry, elevating his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) eyebrows in surprise, <div class="bookquote">``I asked you because I thought you might be able to give me an answer.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>Why do you ask me that, Harry?'' '' That is all. I was going through the park last Sunday, and close by the Marble Arch
<p/>there stood a little crowd of shabby-looking people listening to some vulgar street-preacher. As I passed by, I heard the man yelling out that question to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) audience.
<p/>A wet Sunday, an uncouth Christian in a mackintosh, a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas, and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lips--it was really very good in its way, quite a suggestion.
<p/>It struck me as being rather dramatic. London is very rich in curious effects of that kind. I thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul, but that man had not.
<p/>I am afraid, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have understood me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Don't, Harry. The soul is a terrible reality. It can be bought, and sold, and bartered away.
<p/>It can be poisoned, or made perfect. There is a soul in each one of us. I know it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you feel quite sure of that, Dorian?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Quite sure. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ah! then it must be an illusion. The things one feels absolutely certain about are never true.
<p/>That is the fatality of faith, and the lesson of romance. How grave you are! Don't be so serious. What have you or I to do with the superstitions of our age?
<p/>Play me a nocturne, Dorian, and, as you play, tell me, in a low voice, how you have kept your youth.
<p/>No: we have given up our belief in the soul. Play me something. You must have some secret. I am only ten years older than you are, and I am wrinkled, and worn, and yellow.
<p/>You are really wonderful, Dorian. You have never looked more charming than you do to-night. You remind me of the day I saw you first.
<p/>You were rather cheeky, very shy, and absolutely extraordinary. You have changed, of course, but not in appearance. I wish you would tell me your secret.
<p/>To get back my youth I would do anything in the world, except take exercise, get up early, or be respectable.
<p/>Youth! There is nothing like it. It's absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth. The only people to whose opinions I listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself.
<p/>They seem in front of me. Life has revealed to them her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) latest wonder. As for the aged, I always contradict the aged.
<p/>If you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday, they solemnly give you the opinions current in 1820, when people wore high stocks, believed in everything, and knew absolutely nothing.
<p/>I wonder, did Chopin write it at Majorca, with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes?
<p/>I do it on principle. How lovely that thing you are playing is! It is marvellously romantic. What a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative!
<p/>Don't stop. I want music to-night. It seems to me that you are the young Apollo and that I am Marsyas listening to you.
<p/>I have sorrows, Dorian, of my own, that even you know nothing of. The tragedy of old age is not that one is old, but that one is young.
<p/>I am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity. Ah, Dorian, how happy you are! What an exquisite life you have had!
<p/>You have drunk deeply of everything. You have crushed the grapes against your palate. Nothing has been hidden from you. And it has all been to you no more than the sound of music.
<p/>It has not marred you. You are still the same.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not the same, Harry.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are the same.
<p/>I wonder what the rest of your life will be. Don't spoil it by renunciations. At present you are a perfect type.
<p/>Don't make yourself incomplete. You are quite flawless now. You need not shake your head: you know you are. Besides, Dorian, don't deceive yourself.
<p/>Life is a question of nerves, and fibres, and slowly built-up cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams.
<p/>But a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky, a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it, a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again, a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to play--I tell you, Dorian, that it is on things like these that our lives depend.
<p/>Life is not governed by will or intention. You may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong. Browning writes about that somewhere; but our own senses will imagine them for us.
<p/>There are moments when the odour of lilas blanc passes suddenly across me, and I have to live the strangest month of my life over again.
<p/>I wish I could change places with you, Dorian. The world has cried out against us both, but it has always worshipped you.
<p/>It always will worship you. You are the type of what the age is searching for, and what it is afraid it has found.
<p/>I am so glad that you have never done anything, never carved a statue, or painted a picture, or produced anything outside of yourself!
<p/>Life has been your art. You have set yourself to music. Your days are your sonnets. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian</b></font>)</div>Dorian rose up from the piano and passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hand through his (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) hair.
<p/>'' Yes, life has been exquisite,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) murmured, <div class="bookquote">``but I am not going to have the same life, Harry. And you must not say these extravagant things to me.
<p/>You don't know everything about me. I think that if you did, even you would turn from me. You laugh. Don't laugh.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why have you stopped playing, Dorian? Go back and give me the nocturne over again. Look at that great, honey-coloured moon that hangs in the dusky air.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) is waiting for you to charm her (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>), and if you play she (<font color='blue'><b>Dorian</b></font>) will come closer to the earth. You won't?
<p/>Let us go to the club, then. It has been a charming evening, and we must end it charmingly. There is some one at White's who wants immensely to know you--young Lord Poole, Bournemouth's eldest son.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) has already copied your neckties, and has begged me to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You cannot change to me, Dorian,''  (<font color='red'><b>Lord Henry/Lord Henry Wotton/Henry Wotton</b></font>)</div>said Lord Henry. '' You and I will always be friends.'' '' Yet you poisoned me with a book once.
<p/>I should not forgive that. Harry, promise me that you will never lend that book to any one. It does harm.''
<p/>You will soon be going about like the converted, and the revivalist, warning people against all the sins of which you have grown tired.
<p/>'' My dear boy, you are really beginning to moralize. You are much too delightful to do that. Besides, it is no use.
<p/>You and I are what we are, and will be what we will be. As for being poisoned by a book, there is no such thing as that.
<p/>Art has no influence upon action. It annihilates the desire to act. It is superbly sterile. The books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame.
<p/>That is all. But we won't discuss literature. Come round to-morrow. I am going to ride at eleven. We might go together, and I will take you to lunch afterwards with Lady Branksome.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is a charming woman, and wants to consult you about some tapestries she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) is thinking of buying. Mind you come.
<p/>Or shall we lunch with our little duchess? She (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>duchess</b></font>) never sees you now. Perhaps you are tired of Gladys?
<p/>I thought you would be. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gladys</b></font>) clever tongue gets on one's nerves. Well, in any case, be here at eleven.'' <div class="bookquote">``Must I really come, Harry?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. The park is quite lovely now. I don't think there have been such lilacs since the year I met you.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very well. I shall be here at eleven,''  (<font color='red'><b>Dorian/Dorian Gray/Mr. Gray</b></font>)</div>said Dorian. '' Good night, Harry. '' As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) reached the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) hesitated for a moment, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) had something more to say.
<p/>It was a lovely night, so warm that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) coat over his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) arm and did not even put his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) silk scarf
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) sighed and went out. CHAPTER 20 round his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) throat. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) strolled home, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) cigarette, two young men in evening dress passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) heard one of them whisper to the other, <div class="bookquote">``That is Dorian Gray. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) remembered how pleased he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) used to be when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was pointed out, or stared at, or talked about.
<p/>Half the charm of the little village where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had been so often lately was that no one knew who he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had often told the girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had lured to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was poor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) once that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was wicked, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) and answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) was tired of hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) own name now. What a laugh she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had!--just like a thrush singing. And how pretty she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cotton dresses and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) large hats!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew nothing, but she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had everything that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) had lost. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) reached home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) servant waiting up for him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) to bed, and threw himself down on the sofa in the library, and began to think over some of the things that Lord Henry had said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt a wild longing for the unstained purity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) boyhood--his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) rose-white boyhood, as Lord Henry had once called it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had tarnished himself, filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mind with corruption and given horror to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fancy; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been an evil influence to others, and had experienced a terrible joy in being so; and that of the lives that had crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own, it had been the fairest and the most full of promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had brought to shame.
<p/>Was it really true that one could never change? But was it all irretrievable? Was there no hope for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)? Ah!
<p/>in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had prayed that the portrait should bear the burden of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) days, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) keep the unsullied splendour of eternal youth!
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) failure had been due to that. Better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that each sin of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life had brought its sure swift penalty along with it.
<p/>Not <div class="bookquote">``Forgive us our sins''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>but <div class="bookquote">``Smite us for our iniquities''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>should be the prayer of man to a most just God.
<p/>The curiously carved mirror that Lord Henry had given to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), so many years ago now, was standing on the table, and the white-limbed Cupids laughed round it as of old.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) took it up, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had done on that night of horror when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had first noted the change in the fatal picture, and with wild, tear-dimmed eyes looked into its polished shield.
<p/>There was purification in punishment. Once, some one who had terribly loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) a mad letter, ending with these idolatrous words:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold. The curves of your lips rewrite history. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The phrases came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) memory, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) repeated them over and over to himself.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) loathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own beauty, and flinging the mirror on the floor, crushed it into silver splinters beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heel.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) beauty that had ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) beauty and the youth that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had prayed for. But for those two things, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) life might have been free from stain.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) beauty had been to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) but a mask, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) youth but a mockery. What was youth at best? A green, an unripe time, a time of shallow moods, and sickly thoughts.
<p/>Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) worn its livery? Youth had spoiled him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). It was better not to think of the past. Nothing could alter that.
<p/>It was of himself, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own future, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had to think. James Vane was hidden in a nameless grave in Selby churchyard.
<p/>Alan Campbell had shot himself one night in his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) laboratory, but had not revealed the secret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had been forced to know.
<p/>The excitement, such as it was, over Basil Hallward's disappearance would soon pass away. It was already waning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) was perfectly safe there.
<p/>Nor, indeed, was it the death of Basil Hallward that weighed most upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) mind. It was the living death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) own soul that troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>).
<p/>Basil had painted the portrait that had marred his (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) could not forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) that. It was the portrait that had done everything.
<p/>Basil had said things to him (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) that were unbearable, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Basil</b></font>) had yet borne with patience. The murder had been simply the madness of a moment.
<p/>As for Alan Campbell, his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) suicide had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) own act. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had chosen to do it. It was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<p/>A new life! That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) wanted. That was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was waiting for. Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had begun it already.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had spared one innocent thing, at any rate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would never again tempt innocence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would be good. As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) thought of Hetty Merton, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) began to wonder if the portrait in the locked room had changed.
<p/>Surely it was not still so horrible as it had been? Perhaps if his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) life became pure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face.
<p/>Perhaps the signs of evil had already gone away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would go and look. He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) unbarred the door, a smile of joy flitted across his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) strangely young-looking face and lingered for a moment about his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) lips.
<p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) would be good, and the hideous thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) went in quietly, locking the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>), as was his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) custom, and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) felt as if the load had been lifted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) already. A cry of pain and indignation broke from him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) could see no change, save that in the eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite.
<p/>The thing was still loathsome--more loathsome, if possible, than before--and the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter, and more like blood newly spilled.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) trembled. Had it been merely vanity that had made him (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) do his (<font color='blue'><b>hypocrite</b></font>) one good deed? Or the desire for a new sensation, as Lord Henry had hinted, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mocking laugh?
<p/>Or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are ourselves? Or, perhaps, all these?
<p/>And why was the red stain larger than it had been? It seemed to have crept like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers.
<p/>There was blood on the painted feet, as though the thing had dripped--blood even on the hand that had not held the knife.
<p/>Confess? Did it mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was to confess? To give himself up and be put to death? He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) laughed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt that the idea was monstrous.
<p/>Besides, even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did confess, who would believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)? There was no trace of the murdered man anywhere. Everything belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been destroyed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) himself had burned what had been below-stairs. The world would simply say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was mad. They would shut him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) persisted in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) story....
<p/>Yet it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty to confess, to suffer public shame, and to make public atonement. There was a God who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well as to heaven.
<p/>Nothing that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) could do would cleanse him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) till he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) own sin. His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sin? He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shoulders.
<p/>The death of Basil Hallward seemed very little to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was thinking of Hetty Merton. For it was an unjust mirror, this mirror of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was looking at.
<p/>Vanity? Curiosity? Hypocrisy? Had there been nothing more in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) renunciation than that? There had been something more. At least he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) thought so.
<p/>But who could tell? ... No. There had been nothing more. Through vanity he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Merton</b></font>). In hypocrisy he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had worn the mask of goodness.
<p/>For curiosity's sake he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had tried the denial of self. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) recognized that now. But this murder--was it to dog him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) life?
<p/>Was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) always to be burdened by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) past? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) really to confess? Never. There was only one bit of evidence left against him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>The picture itself--that was evidence. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would destroy it. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kept it so long? Once it had given him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pleasure to watch it changing and growing old.
<p/>Of late he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had felt no such pleasure. It had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) awake at night. When he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been away, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon it.
<p/>It had brought melancholy across his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) passions. Its mere memory had marred many moments of joy. It had been like conscience to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Yes, it had been conscience. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would destroy it. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed Basil Hallward.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hallward</b></font>) had cleaned it many times, till there was no stain left upon it. It was bright, and glistened. As it had killed the painter, so it would kill the painter's work, and all that that meant.
<p/>It would kill the past, and when that was dead, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would be free. It would kill this monstrous soul-life, and without its hideous warnings, he (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) would be at peace.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) seized the thing, and stabbed the picture with it. There was a cry heard, and a crash. The cry was so horrible in its agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms.
<p/>Two gentlemen, who were passing in the square below, stopped and looked up at the great house. They walked on till they met a policeman and brought him (<font color='blue'><b>policeman</b></font>) back.
<p/>The man rang the bell several times, but there was no answer. Except for a light in one of the top windows, the house was all dark.
<p/>After a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went away and stood in an adjoining portico and watched. '' Whose house is that, Constable?'' asked the elder of the two gentlemen.
<p/>'' Mr. Dorian Gray's, sir,'' answered the policeman. They looked at each other, as they walked away, and sneered. One of them was Sir Henry Ashton's uncle.
<p/>Inside, in the servants' part of the house, the half-clad domestics were talking in low whispers to each other. Old Mrs. Leaf was crying and wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Leaf</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Francis was as pale as death. After about a quarter of an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Francis</b></font>) got the coachman and one of the footmen and crept upstairs.
<p/>They knocked, but there was no reply. They called out. Everything was still. Finally, after vainly trying to force the door, they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony.
<p/>When they entered, they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of their master as they had last seen him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), in all the wonder of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) exquisite youth and beauty.
<p/>The windows yielded easily--their bolts were old. Lying on the floor was a dead man, in evening dress, with a knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was withered, wrinkled, and loathsome of visage. It was not till they had examined the rings that they recognized who it was.
