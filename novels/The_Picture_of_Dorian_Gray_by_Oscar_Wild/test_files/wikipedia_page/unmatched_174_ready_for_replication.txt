in response wilde aggressively defended his novel and #art# in correspondence with the british press although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for #book# publication the following #year#
the longer and revised version of the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ published in #book# form in featured an aphoristic preface a defence of the #artist# rights and of #art# for #art# sake

as literature of the century the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ pivots on gothic plot device with strong themes interpreted from faust
$mr_dorian_gray$ is the subject of full length #portrait# in oil by $basil_hallward$ an #artist# impressed and infatuated by $mr_dorian_gray$ #beauty# he believes that $mr_dorian_gray$ #beauty# is responsible for the new mood in his #art# as #painter#
through $basil_hallward$ $mr_dorian_gray$ meets $lord_henry_wotton$ and he soon is enthralled by the aristocrat hedonistic #world# view that #beauty# and sensual fulfilment are the only #thing# worth pursuing in #life#
newly understanding that his #beauty# will fade $mr_dorian_gray$ expresses the desire to sell his #soul# to ensure that the #picture# rather than he will #age# and fade
the wish is granted and $mr_dorian_gray$ pursues libertine #life# of varied amoral experiences while staying young and beautiful all the while his #portrait# #age# and records every #sin#
the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ begins on beautiful summer #day# in victorian era england where $lord_henry_wotton$ an opinionated #man# is observing the sensitive #artist# $basil_hallward$ painting the #portrait# of $mr_dorian_gray$ handsome young #man# who is $basil_hallward$ ultimate muse
while sitting for the painting $mr_dorian_gray$ listens to $lord_henry_wotton$ espousing his hedonistic #world# view and begins to think that #beauty# is the only aspect of #life# worth pursuing prompting $mr_dorian_gray$ to wish that his #portrait# would #age# instead of himself
the content style and presentation of the preface made it famous in its own right as literary and artistic manifesto under $lord_henry_wotton$ hedonistic influence $mr_dorian_gray$ fully explores his sensuality
he discovers the actress $sibyl_vane$ who performs shakespeare plays in dingy working class theatre $mr_dorian_gray$ approaches and courts her and soon proposes marriage
the enamoured $sibyl_vane$ calls him $prince_charming$ and swoons with the happiness of being loved but her protective brother $james_vane$ warns that if $prince_charming$ harms her he will murder him
$sibyl_vane$ too enamoured with $mr_dorian_gray$ to act performs poorly which makes both $basil_hallward$ and $lord_henry_wotton$ think $mr_dorian_gray$ has fallen in #love# with $sibyl_vane$ because of her #beauty# instead of her acting talent
$mr_dorian_gray$ invites $basil_hallward$ and $lord_henry_wotton$ to see $sibyl_vane$ perform in romeo and juliet embarrassed $mr_dorian_gray$ rejects $sibyl_vane$ telling her that acting was her #beauty# without that she no longer interests him
on returning home $mr_dorian_gray$ notices that the #portrait# has changed his wish has come true and the #man# in the #portrait# bears subtle sneer of cruelty
conscience stricken and lonely $mr_dorian_gray$ decides to reconcile with $sibyl_vane$ but he is too late as $lord_henry_wotton$ informs him that $sibyl_vane$ has killed herself
$mr_dorian_gray$ observes the corruption recorded in his #portrait# in the film the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ $mr_dorian_gray$ then understands that where his #life# is headed lust and #beauty# shall suffice
$mr_dorian_gray$ locks the #portrait# up and over the following eighteen #year# he experiments with every vice influenced by morally poisonous french novel that $lord_henry_wotton$ gave him
#one# #night# before leaving for paris $basil_hallward$ goes to $mr_dorian_gray$ #house# to ask him about rumors of his self indulgent sensualism
the #portrait# has become so hideous that $basil_hallward$ is only able to identify it as his by the signature he affixes to all his #portrait#
$mr_dorian_gray$ does not deny his debauchery and takes $basil_hallward$ to see the #portrait# $basil_hallward$ is horrified and beseeches $mr_dorian_gray$ to pray for salvation
$mr_dorian_gray$ then calmly blackmails an old #friend# the scientist $alan_campbell$ into using his knowledge of chemistry to destroy the body of $basil_hallward$
in anger $mr_dorian_gray$ blames his fate on $basil_hallward$ and stabs him to #death# a century london opium den based on fictional accounts of the #day#
$james_vane$ had been seeking vengeance upon $mr_dorian_gray$ ever since $sibyl_vane$ killed herself but had no leads to pursue the only #thing# he knew about $mr_dorian_gray$ was the #name# $sibyl_vane$ called him $prince_charming$
to escape the guilt of his crime $mr_dorian_gray$ goes to an opium den where $james_vane$ is unknowingly present in the opium den however he hears someone refer to $mr_dorian_gray$ as $prince_charming$ and he accosts $mr_dorian_gray$
$mr_dorian_gray$ deceives $james_vane$ into believing that he is too young to have known $sibyl_vane$ who killed herself #year# earlier as his #face# is still that of young #man#
$james_vane$ relents and releases $mr_dorian_gray$ but is then approached by #woman# from the opium den who reproaches $james_vane$ for not killing $mr_dorian_gray$
she confirms that the #man# was $mr_dorian_gray$ and explains that he has not aged in #year# $james_vane$ runs after $mr_dorian_gray$ but he has gone
$james_vane$ then begins to stalk $mr_dorian_gray$ causing $mr_dorian_gray$ to fear for his #life# however during shooting party hunter accidentally kills $james_vane$ who was lurking in thicket
on returning to london $mr_dorian_gray$ tells $lord_henry_wotton$ that he will live righteously from now on his new probity begins with deliberately not breaking the heart of the naïve hetty merton his current romantic interest
$mr_dorian_gray$ wonders if his newfound goodness has reverted the corruption in the #picture# but when he #look# at it he sees only an even uglier image of himself
from that $mr_dorian_gray$ understands that his true motives for the self sacrifice of moral reformation were the vanity and curiosity of his quest for new experiences along with the desire to restore #beauty# to the #picture#
deciding that only full confession will absolve him of wrongdoing $mr_dorian_gray$ decides to destroy the last vestige of his conscience and the only piece of evidence remaining of his crimes
the servants of the #house# awaken on hearing cry from the locked #room# on the street passerby who also heard the cry calls the police
on entering the locked #room# the servants find an unknown old #man# stabbed in the heart his figure withered and decrepit
the #picture# in rage he takes the knife with which he murdered $basil_hallward$ and stabs the #picture# the servants identify the disfigured corpse by the rings on its fingers which belonged to $mr_dorian_gray$
beside him the #portrait# is now restored to its former appearance of #beauty# oscar wilde said that in the novel the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ three of the characters were reflections of himself
the #painter# $basil_hallward$ and the aristocrat $lord_henry_wotton$ observe the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ the characters of the story are $mr_dorian_gray$ a handsome narcissistic young #man# enthralled by $lord_henry_wotton$ new hedonism
$basil_hallward$ a deeply moral #man# the #painter# of the #portrait# and infatuated with $mr_dorian_gray$ whose patronage realises his potential as an #artist#
he indulges in every #pleasure# and virtually every in studying its effect upon him which eventually leads to his #death# the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ is $basil_hallward$ masterpiece
$lord_henry_wotton$ $harry$ wotton an imperious aristocrat and decadent dandy who espouses philosophy of self indulgent hedonism initially $basil_hallward$ #friend# he neglects him for $mr_dorian_gray$ #beauty#
the character of witty lord $harry$ is critique of victorian culture at the fin de siècle of britain at the end of the century
lord $harry$ libertine #world# view corrupts $mr_dorian_gray$ who then successfully emulates him to the aristocrat $harry$ the observant #artist# $basil_hallward$ says you never say moral #thing# and you never do wrong #thing#
$lord_henry_wotton$ takes #pleasure# in impressing influencing and even misleading his acquaintances to which purpose he bends his considerable wit and eloquence but appears not to observe his own hedonistic advice preferring to study himself with scientific detachment
his distinguishing feature is total indifference to the consequences of his actions scholars generally accept the character is partly inspired by wilde #friend# lord ronald gower
$sibyl_vane$ a talented actress and singer she is beautiful #girl# from poor family with whom $mr_dorian_gray$ falls in #love#
her #love# for $mr_dorian_gray$ ruins her acting ability because she no longer finds #pleasure# in portraying fictional #love# as she is now experiencing real #love# in her #life#
she kills herself on learning that $mr_dorian_gray$ no longer #love# her at that $lord_henry_wotton$ likens her to ophelia in hamlet
$james_vane$ $sibyl_vane$ brother sailor who leaves for australia he is very protective of his sister especially as their $mother$ cares only for $mr_dorian_gray$ money
believing that $mr_dorian_gray$ means to harm $sibyl_vane$ $james_vane$ hesitates to leave and promises vengeance upon $mr_dorian_gray$ if any harm befalls her
the brother pursuit of vengeance upon the lover $mr_dorian_gray$ for the #death# of the sister $sibyl_vane$ parallels that of laertes vengeance against prince hamlet
after $sibyl_vane$ suicide $james_vane$ becomes obsessed with killing $mr_dorian_gray$ and stalks him but hunter accidentally kills $james_vane$ $alan_campbell$ chemist and #one# #time# #friend# of $mr_dorian_gray$ who ended their friendship when $mr_dorian_gray$ libertine reputation devalued such friendship
$mr_dorian_gray$ blackmails $alan_campbell$ into destroying the body of the murdered $basil_hallward$ $alan_campbell$ later shoots himself dead lord fermor $lord_henry_wotton$ uncle who tells his nephew $lord_henry_wotton$ about the family lineage of $mr_dorian_gray$
a youthful #friend# of $mr_dorian_gray$ whom he evidently introduced to opium addiction which induced him to forge cheque and made him total outcast from his family and social set
$adrian_singleton$ victoria lady $lord_henry_wotton$ $lord_henry_wotton$ wife whom he treats disdainfully she later divorces him the main theme in the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ is aestheticism and its conceptual relation to living double #life#
throughout the story the narrative presents aestheticism as an absurd abstraction which disillusions more than it dignifies the concept of #beauty#
despite $mr_dorian_gray$ being hedonist when $basil_hallward$ accuses him of making by #word# of the #name# of $lord_henry_wotton$ sister $mr_dorian_gray$ curtly replies take care $basil_hallward$
yet wilde highlights the protagonist hedonism $mr_dorian_gray$ enjoyed keenly the terrible #pleasure# of double #life# by attending high society party only twenty four hours after committing murder
you go too far thus in victorian society public image and social standing do matter to $mr_dorian_gray$ moral duplicity and self indulgence are evident in $mr_dorian_gray$ patronage of london opium dens
wilde conflates the images of the upper class #man# and lower class #man# in $mr_dorian_gray$ gentleman slumming for strong entertainment in the poor parts of london town
$lord_henry_wotton$ philosophically had earlier said to him that crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders i should fancy that crime was to them what #art# is to us
that authorial observation is thematic link to the double #life# recounted in the strange case of dr jekyll and mr hyde by robert louis stevenson novella admired by oscar wilde
in #book# of plato the republic glaucon and adeimantus present the myth of the ring of gyges by means of which gyges made himself invisible
simply method of procuring extraordinary sensations implying that $mr_dorian_gray$ is two #man# refined aesthete and coarse criminal they then ask socrates if #one# came into possession of such ring why should he act justly
the disfigured and corrupted #soul# antithesis of the beautiful #soul# is imbalanced and disordered and in itself is undesirable regardless of any advantage derived from acting unjustly
the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ is the means by which other #people# such as his #friend# $basil_hallward$ may see $mr_dorian_gray$ distorted #soul#
socrates replies that although no #one# can see #one# body the #soul# is disfigured by the evils #one# commits $mr_dorian_gray$ attends performance of tannhäuser by richard wagner and the narrative identifies him with the protagonist of the opera
disruptive #beauty# is the thematic resemblance between the opera and the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ based upon medieval historical figure tannhäuser is singer whose #art# is so beautiful that venus becomes enamoured of him
the roman goddess of #love# then offers him eternal #life# with her in the venusberg and he accepts yet tannhäuser becomes dissatisfied with #life# in the venusberg and returns to the harsh reality of the mortal #world#
after participating in singing contest tannhäuser is censured for the sensuality of his #art# eventually he dies searching for repentance and the #love# of good #woman#
about the literary hero the author oscar wilde said in every first novel the hero is the author as christ or faust
as in the legend of faust in the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ temptation ageless #beauty# is placed before the protagonist which he indulges
in each story the protagonist entices beautiful #woman# to #love# him and then destroys her #life# in the preface to the novel
wilde said that the notion behind the tale is old in the history of literature but was thematic subject to which he had given new form
unlike the academic faust the gentleman $mr_dorian_gray$ makes no deal with the devil who is represented by the cynical hedonist $lord_henry_wotton$ who presents the temptation that will corrupt the virtue and innocence that $mr_dorian_gray$ possesses at the start of the story
throughout $lord_henry_wotton$ appears unaware of the effect of his actions upon the young #man# and so frivolously advises $mr_dorian_gray$ that the only #way# to get rid of temptation is to yield to it
resist it and your #soul# grows sick with longing as such the devilish $lord_henry_wotton$ is leading $mr_dorian_gray$ into an unholy pact by manipulating his innocence and insecurity
in chapter five he writes he felt as if he had come to #look# for miranda and had been met by caliban
when $mr_dorian_gray$ tells $lord_henry_wotton$ about his new #love# $sibyl_vane$ he mentions the shakespeare plays in which she has acted and refers to her by the #name# of the heroine of each play
later $mr_dorian_gray$ speaks of his #life# by quoting hamlet privileged character who impels his potential suitor ophelia to suicide and prompts her brother laertes to swear mortal revenge
in the preface to the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ wilde speaks of the sub human caliban character from the tempest the anonymous poisonous french novel that leads $mr_dorian_gray$ to his fall is thematic variant of rebours by joris karl huysmans
in the biography oscar wilde the literary critic richard ellmann said that wilde does not #name# the #book# but at his trial he conceded that it was or almost huysmans rebours to correspondent he wrote that he had played fantastic variation upon rebours and someday must write it down
some commentators have suggested that the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ was influenced by the british prime minister benjamin disraeli anonymously published first novel vivian grey as a kind of homage from #one# outsider to another
the #name# of $mr_dorian_gray$ #love# interest $sibyl_vane$ may be modified fusion of the title of disraeli best known novel sybil and vivian grey #love# interest violet fane who like $sibyl_vane$ dies tragically
there is also scene in vivian grey in which the #eye# in the #portrait# of beautiful being move when its subject dies
the references in $mr_dorian_gray$ to specific chapters are deliberately inaccurate the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ originally was novella submitted to lippincott monthly magazine for serial publication
on august stoddart dined with oscar wilde #sir# arthur conan doyle andt gill at the langham hotel and commissioned novellas from each writer
conan doyle promptly submitted the sign of the four to stoddart but wilde was more dilatory conan doyle second sherlock holmes novel was published in the february edition of lippincott monthly magazine yet stoddart did not receive wilde manuscript for the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ until april nine months after having commissioned the novel from him
the title page of the ward lock co edition of the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ with decorative lettering designed by charles ricketts
the literary merits of the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ impressed stoddart but as an editor he told the publisher george lippincott in its present condition there are number of #thing# an innocent #woman# would make an exception to
among the pre publication deletions that stoddart and his editors made to the text of wilde original manuscript were i passages alluding to homosexuality and to homosexual desire ii all references to the fictional #book# title le #secret# de raoul and its author catulle sarrazin and iii all mistress references to $mr_dorian_gray$ lovers $sibyl_vane$ and hetty merton
in m stoddart an editor for lippincott was in london to solicit novellas to publish in the magazine the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ was published on june in the july issue of lippincott monthly magazine
british reviewers condemned the novel immorality and said condemnation was so controversial that the smith publishing #house# withdrew every copy of the july issue of lippincott monthly magazine from its bookstalls in railway stations
consequent to the harsh criticism of the magazine edition wilde ameliorated the homoerotic references to simplify the moral message of the story
in the magazine edition $basil_hallward$ tells $lord_henry_wotton$ how he worships $mr_dorian_gray$ and begs him not to take away the #one# person that makes my #life# absolutely lovely to me
in the magazine edition $basil_hallward$ concentrates upon #love# whereas in the #book# edition $basil_hallward$ concentrates upon his #art# saying to $lord_henry_wotton$ the #one# person who gives my #art# whatever charm it may possess my #life# as an #artist# depends on him
the magazine edition of the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ was expanded from thirteen to twenty chapters and the magazine edition final chapter was divided into two chapters the nineteenth and twentieth chapters of the #book# edition of the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$
wilde textual additions were about fleshing out of $mr_dorian_gray$ as character and providing details of his ancestry that made his psychological collapse more prolonged and more convincing
the introduction of the $james_vane$ character to the story develops the socio economic background of the $sibyl_vane$ character thus emphasising $mr_dorian_gray$ selfishness and foreshadowing $james_vane$ accurate perception of the essentially immoral character of $mr_dorian_gray$ thus he correctly deduced $mr_dorian_gray$ dishonourable intent towards $sibyl_vane$
the sub plot about $james_vane$ dislike of $mr_dorian_gray$ gives the novel victorian tinge of class struggle with such textual changes oscar wilde meant to diminish the moralistic controversy about the novel the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$
consequent to the harsh criticism of the magazine edition of the novel the textual revisions to the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ included preface in which wilde addressed the criticisms and defended the reputation of his novel
to communicate how the novel should be read in the preface wilde explains the role of the #artist# in society the purpose of #art# and the value of #beauty#
it traces wilde cultural exposure to taoism and to the philosophy of chuang tsǔ zhuang zhou earlier before writing the preface wilde had written #book# review of herbert giles translation of the #work# of zhuang zhou
the preface was first published in the edition of the novel nonetheless by june wilde was defending the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ against accusations that it was bad #book#
in the essay the #artist# as critic oscar wilde said that the honest ratepayer and his healthy family have no doubt often mocked at the dome like forehead of the philosopher and laughed over the strange perspective of the landscape that lies beneath him
for chuang tsǔ spent his #life# in preaching the great creed of inaction and in pointing out the uselessness of all #thing#
if they really knew who he was they would tremble in the century the critical reception of the novel the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ was poor
the #book# critic of the irish #time# said the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ was first published to some scandal such #book# reviews achieved for the novel certain notoriety for being mawkish and nauseous unclean effeminate and contaminating
yet most of the criticism was personal attacking wilde for being hedonist with distorted view of conventional morality of victorian britain
in the june issue of the daily chronicle the #book# critic said that wilde novel contains #one# element which will taint every young mind that comes in contact with it
such moralistic scandal arose from the novel homoeroticism which offended the sensibilities social literary and aesthetic of victorian #book# critics
in the july issue of the scots observer reviewer asked why must oscar wilde go grubbing in muck heaps in response to such criticism wilde obscured the homoeroticism of the story and expanded the personal background of the characters
original manuscript of the opening of chapter four after the initial publication of the magazine edition of the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ wilde expanded the text from to chapters and obscured the homoerotic themes of the story
in the novel version of the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ chapters and to inclusive are new and chapter of the magazine edition was divided and became chapters and of the novel edition
in at his trials oscar wilde said he revised the text of the #picture# of $mr_dorian_gray$ because of letters sent to him by the cultural critic walter pater
$basil_hallward$ about $mr_dorian_gray$ he has stood as paris in dainty armour and as adonis with huntsman cloak and polished boar spear
he has leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the water silent silver the wonder of his own #beauty#
crowned with heavy lotus blossoms he has sat on the prow of $adrian_singleton$ barge looking into the green turbid nile
$lord_henry_wotton$ describes fidelity it has #nothing# to do with our own will it is either an unfortunate accident or an unpleasant result of temperament
i dont know whether he has any #passion# but he certainly has romance said $lord_henry_wotton$ with an amused #look# in his #eye#
you dont mean to say that $basil_hallward$ has got any #passion# or any romance in him has he never let you know that
i must ask him about it i am rather surprised to hear it $basil_hallward$ described rugged and straightforward as he was there was #something# in his nature that was purely feminine in its tenderness
$basil_hallward$ to $mr_dorian_gray$ it is quite true that have worshipped you with far more romance of feeling than #man# usually gives to #friend#
perhaps as $harry$ says really grande #passion# is the privilege of those who have #nothing# to do and that is the use of the idle classes in country
$basil_hallward$ confronts $mr_dorian_gray$ dorian $mr_dorian_gray$ your reputation is infamous i know you and $harry$ are great #friend# i say #nothing# about that now but surely you need not have made his sister #name# by #word#
the first part of this passage was deleted from the magazine text the second part of the passage was inserted to the novel text
each class would have preached the importance of those virtues for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own #life#
the rich would have spoken on the value of thrift and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour
a grande #passion# is the privilege of #people# who have #nothing# to do that is the #one# use of the idle classes of country
i must analyse it some #day# the #passion# for property is in it there are many #thing# that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up
