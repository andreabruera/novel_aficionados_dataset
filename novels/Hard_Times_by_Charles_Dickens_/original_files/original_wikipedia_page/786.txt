Hard Times For These Times (commonly known as Hard Times) is the tenth novel by Charles Dickens, first published in .
The book surveys English society and satirises the social and economic conditions of the era.
Hard Times is unusual in several ways.
It is by far the shortest of Dickens' novels, barely quarter of the length of those written immediately before and after it.
Also, unlike all but one of his other novels, Hard Times has neither preface nor illustrations.
Moreover, it is his only novel not to have scenes set in London.
Instead the story is set in the fictitious Victorian industrial Coketown, generic Northern English mill town, in some ways similar to Manchester, though smaller.
Coketown may be partially based on century Preston.
One of Dickens reasons for writing Hard Times was that sales of his weekly periodical, Household Words, were low, and it was hoped the novel publication in instalments would boost circulation as indeed proved to be the case.
Since publication it has received mixed response from critics.
Critics such as George Bernard Shaw and Thomas Macaulay have mainly focused on Dickens treatment of trade unions and his post–Industrial Revolution pessimism regarding the divide between capitalist mill owners and undervalued workers during the Victorian era.
F. R. Leavis, great admirer of the book, included it but not Dickens' work as whole as part of his Great Tradition of English novels.
The role of status on morality
The novel was published as serial in Dickens weekly publication, Household Words.
Sales were highly responsive and encouraging for Dickens who remarked that he was "Three parts mad, and the fourth delirious, with perpetual rushing at Hard Times".
The novel was serialised, in twenty weekly parts, between April and August .
It sold well, and complete volume was published in August, totalling words.
Another related novel, North and South by Elizabeth Gaskell, was also published in this magazine.
The novel follows classical tripartite structure, and the titles of each book are related to Galatians "For whatsoever man soweth, that shall he also reap."
Book is entitled "Sowing", Book II is entitled "Reaping", and the third is "Garnering."
Superintendent Mr. Gradgrind opens the novel at his school in Coketown stating, "Now, what want is Facts.
Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts", and interrogates one of his pupils, Cecilia (nicknamed Sissy), whose father works at circus.
Because her father works with horses, Gradgrind demands the definition of horse.
When she is scolded for her inability to factually define horse, her classmate Bitzer gives zoological profile.
Louisa and Thomas, two of Mr. Gradgrind children, go after school to see the touring circus run by Mr. Sleary, only to meet their father, who orders them home.
Mr. Gradgrind has three younger children: Adam Smith (after the famous theorist of laissez faire policy), Malthus (after Rev.
Thomas Malthus, who wrote An Essay on the Principle of Population, warning of the dangers of future overpopulation), and Jane.
Gradgrind apprehends Louisa and Tom, his two eldest children, caught peeping at the circus.
Josiah Bounderby, "a man perfectly devoid of sentiment", is revealed as Gradgrind close friend.
Bounderby is manufacturer and mill owner who is affluent as result of his enterprise and capital.
He often gives dramatic and falsified accounts of his childhood, which terrifies Mr. Gradgrind housekeeper, Mrs. Sparsit.
As they consider her bad influence on the other children, Gradgrind and Bounderby prepare to dismiss Sissy from the school; but the three soon discover her father has abandoned her thereto, in hope that she will lead better life without him.
At this point members of the circus appear, led by their manager, Mr. Sleary.
Mr. Gradgrind gives Sissy choice: to return to the circus and forfeit her education, or to continue her education and work for Mrs. Gradgrind, never returning to the circus.
Sissy accepts the latter, hoping to be reunited with her father.
At the Gradgrind house, Tom and Louisa are discontented by their education, and so does Sissy.
Amongst the mill workers, known as "the Hands"): another of the story protagonists.
When introduced, he has ended his day work and meets his close friend Rachael.
On entering his house he finds that his drunken wife who has been living away from him has made an unwelcome return.
Stephen is greatly perturbed, and visits Bounderby to ask how he can legally end his marriage.
Mrs. Sparsit, Mr. Bounderby paid companion, disapproves of Stephen query and Bounderby explains that ending marriage would be complex and prohibitively costly.
Leaving the house, Stephen meets an old woman who seems interested in Bounderby and says she visits Coketown once year.
Upon returning, he finds Rachel caring for his wife.
Gradgrind tells Louisa that Josiah Bounderby, years her senior, has proposed marriage to her.
Louisa passively accepts the offer, and the newlyweds set out to Lyons (Lyon), where Bounderby wants to observe how labour is used in the factories there.
Tom, her brother, elatedly bids her farewell.
Book Two opens on Bounderby bank in Coketown, over which the "light porter", Sissy old classmate Bitzer, and the austere Mrs. Sparsit keep watch at the afternoon.
A well dressed gentleman asks for directions to Bounderby house, as Gradgrind has sent him from London with letter of introduction.
It is James Harthouse, who has tried several occupations and been bored by all of them.
Harthouse is introduced to Bounderby, who accepts him and then regales him with improbable brief mention of his childhood.
Harthouse is utterly bored by him, but enamoured of the now melancholy Louisa.
Louisa brother Tom works for Bounderby, and has become reckless and wayward in his conduct.
Tom admires Harthouse, who holds him in some contempt, and Tom discloses contempt for Bounderby in the presence of Harthouse, who notes Louisa affection for Tom and later learns that Tom has money problems and that Tom persuaded Louisa to marry Bounderby to make his own life easier.
At crowded union meeting, the agitator Slackridge accuses Stephen Blackpool of treachery because he will not join the union, and Stephen learns he is to be ent to Coventry' shunned by all his fellow workers.
Summoned by Bounderby, he is asked what the men are complaining of; and when Stephen tries to explain, Bounderby accuses Stephen of being troublemaker and sacks him.
Later Louisa and Tom visit Stephen, expressing regret, and Louisa gives him some money.
Privately, Tom tells him to wait outside the bank after work.
When robbery takes place at the bank, Stephen is suspected of the crime; even more so as he had left the town the next day.
Mrs. Sparsit observes the advancing relationship between James Harthouse and Louisa, and suspects an adulterous liaison.
Unable to hear their dialogue, she assumes the affair is progressing.
When Harthouse confesses his love for Louisa, Louisa refuses him.
They leave separately, and Mrs. Sparsit follows Louisa to the station, where Louisa boards train to her father house; Mrs Sparsit loses her.
When Louisa arrives, she is in an extreme state of distress.
Having argued that her rigorous education has stifled her ability to express her emotions, Louisa collapses at her father feet in dead faint.
At Bounderby London hotel Mrs. Sparsit gives him the news her surveillance has brought.
Bounderby takes her back to Coketown and to Stone Lodge, where Louisa is resting.
Gradgrind tells Bounderby that Louisa resisted Harthouse advances, but has experienced crisis and needs time to recover.
Bounderby is immensely indignant and ill mannered, especially towards Mrs. Sparsit for misleading him.
Ignoring Gradgrind pleas, he announces that unless Louisa returns to him the next day, the marriage will terminate.
Harthouse leaves Coketown after Sissy tells him never to return.
As Slackridge increasingly blackens Stephen Blackpool name, Rachael goes to the bank to say she knows where he is, and that she will write asking him to return to Coketown to clear his name.
Bounderby is suspicious when she tells him Stephen was visited by Louisa and Tom the night he was dismissed, and brings her to Gradgrind house where Louisa confirms Rachael account.
Mrs. Sparsit eventually tracks down Mrs. Pegler, the old woman who makes mysterious annual visit to see Bounderby house, and brings her to the house where she is revealed as Bounderby mother.
Far from having abandoned him to life of hardship, she gave him good upbringing and, when he became successful, allowed herself to be persuaded never to visit him.
Bounderby is now publicly exposed as ridiculous humbug.
On Sunday outing, Rachael and Sissy find Stephen, who has fallen down an abandoned pit shaft while walking back to Coketown.
He is rescued by villagers; but after professing his innocence and speaking to Rachael for the last time, he dies.
Louisa and Sissy now suspect that Tom has committed the bank robbery, and simply told Stephen to loiter outside the bank in order to incriminate him.
Sissy has already helped Tom escape by sending him to join Mr. Sleary circus.
Louisa and Sissy find Tom there, disguised in blackface.
Gradgrind arrives and despairs, and plan is hatched with Sleary co operation to get Tom to Liverpool, where he can escape abroad.
The plan is temporarily foiled by the arrival of Bitzer, who hopes to obtain promotion from Bounderby by bringing Tom to justice; but Sleary arranges an ambush and Tom is taken to Liverpool where he boards ship.
Bounderby punishes Mrs Sparsit for his humiliation by turning her out, but she doesn't particularly mind the dishonour.
Five years later, he will die of fit in the street.
Rachael will continue her life of honest hard work.
Tom will die from fever fairly near Coketown, having expressed penitence in tear stained letter.
Louisa herself will grow old, but will remarry and have children of her own.
Louisa, showing kindness to the less fortunate and being loved by Sissy children, will spend her life encouraging imagination and fancy in all she encounters.
Thomas Gradgrind is the notorious school board Superintendent in Dickens novel Hard Times who is dedicated to the pursuit of profitable enterprise.
His name is now used generically to refer to someone who is hard and only concerned with cold facts and numbers.
He is an intense follower of Utilitarian ideas.
He soon sees the error of these beliefs however, when his children lives fall into disarray.
Josiah Bounderby is business associate of Mr. Gradgrind.
Given to boasting about being self made man, he employs many of the other central characters of the novel.
He has risen to position of power and wealth from humble origins (though not as humble as he claims).
He marries Mr. Gradgrind daughter Louisa, some years his junior, in what turns out to be loveless marriage.
Bounderby is callous, self centred and ultimately revealed to be liar and fraud.
Louisa (Loo) Gradgrind, later Louisa Bounderby, is the eldest child of the Gradgrind family.
She has been taught to suppress her feelings and finds it hard to express herself clearly, saying as child that she has "unmanageable thoughts."
After her unhappy marriage, she is tempted to adultery by James Harthouse, but resists him and returns to her father.
Her rejection of Harthouse leads to new understanding of life and of the value of emotions and the imagination.
She reproaches her father for his dry and fact based approach to the world and convinces him of the error of his ways.
Cecilia (Sissy) Jupe is circus girl of Sleary circus, as well as student of Thomas Gradgrind very strict classroom.
Sissy has her own set of values and beliefs which make her seem unintelligent in the Gradgrind household.
At the end of the novel, when the Gradgrinds' philosophy of religiously adhering solely to facts breaks down, Sissy is the character who teaches them how to live.
Sissy Jupe is first introduced to the readers as Girl Number Twenty in Gradgrind classroom.
She struggles to keep up with Gradgrind extreme reliance on the recitation of facts, and therefore is seen as not worthy of the school.
Sissy is also representative of creativity and wonderment because of her circus background, and those were things that the Gradgrind children were not allowed to engage in.
With the urging of Josiah Bounderby, Mr. Gradgrind goes to inform Sissy father that she can no longer attend his school.
Gradgrind and Bounderby arrive at the Pegasus' Arms, the Coketown public house where Sissy, her father, and the rest of Sleary circus were staying.
While Sissy and her father were very close once, Mr. Jupe packed up and abandoned his daughter, leaving Sissy alone.
In moment of compassion, Mr. Gradgrind takes Sissy into his home and gives her second chance at the school.
Sissy continues to fall behind in the school, so Mr. Gradgrind keeps her at home to tend to his invalid wife.
While Sissy is the device of imagination and fantasy in the novel, she also serves as the voice of reason.
The reason she cannot grasp the philosophy of Gradgrind classroom is because she actually has more realistic view of how the world should be perceived.
After Louisa and Mr. Gradgrind come to terms with the fact that their way of life is not working, Sissy is the one they come to; she takes care of Louisa and helps her live new, happy life.
Thomas (Tom) Gradgrind, Junior is the oldest son and second child of the Gradgrinds.
Initially sullen and resentful of his father Utilitarian education, Tom has strong relationship with his sister Louisa.
He works in Bounderby bank (which he later robs), and turns to gambling and drinking.
Louisa never ceases to adore Tom, and she aids Sissy and Mr. Gradgrind in saving her brother from arrest.
Stephen Blackpool is worker at one of Bounderby mills.
He has drunken wife who no longer lives with him but who appears from time to time.
He forms close bond with Rachael, co worker, whom he wishes to marry.
After dispute with Bounderby, he is dismissed from his work at the Coketown mills and, shunned by his former fellow workers, is forced to look for work elsewhere.
While absent from Coketown, he is wrongly accused of robbing Bounderby bank.
On his way back to vindicate himself, he falls down mine shaft.
He is rescued but dies of his injuries.
Bitzer is very pale classmate of Sissy who is brought up on facts and taught to operate according to self interest.
He takes up job in Bounderby bank, and later tries to arrest Tom.
Rachael is the friend of Stephen Blackpool who attests to his innocence when he is accused of robbing Bounderby bank by Tom.
She is factory worker, childhood friend of Blackpool drunken and often absent wife, and becomes the literary tool for bringing the two parallel story lines together at the brink of Hell Shaft in the final book.
Mrs. Sparsit is widow who has fallen on hard times.
She is employed by Bounderby, and is jealous when he marries Louisa, delighting in the belief that Louisa is later about to elope with James Harthouse.
Her machinations are unsuccessful and she is ultimately sacked by Bounderby.
James Harthouse is an indolent, languid, upper class gentleman, who attempts to woo Louisa.
Mrs. Gradgrind the wife of Mr. Gradgrind, is an invalid who constantly complains.
Tom Sr. apparent attraction to her is because she totally lacks 'fancy,' though she also appears to be unintelligent and without empathy for her children.
Mr. Sleary the owner of the circus which employs Sissy father.
A kind man, he helps both Sissy and young Tom when they are in trouble.
Mrs. Pegler an old woman who sometimes visits Coketown to observe the Bounderby estate.
She is later revealed to be Bounderby mother, proving his "rags to riches" story to be fraudulent.

Dickens wished to educate readers about the working conditions of some of the factories in the industrial towns of Manchester, and Preston, to "strike the heaviest blow in my power", and as well to confront the assumption that prosperity runs parallel to morality.
This notion he systematically deconstructed in through his portrayal of the moral monsters, Mr. Bounderby and James Harthouse.
Dickens also believed in the importance of the imagination, and that people lives should not be reduced to collection of material facts and statistics.
The description of the circus, which he describes as caring so "little for Plain Fact", is an example of this.

The Utilitarians were one of the targets of Dickens' satire.
Utilitarianism was prevalent school of thought during this period, its founders being Jeremy Bentham and James Mill, father to political theorist John Stuart Mill.
Bentham former secretary, Edwin Chadwick, helped design the Poor Law of which deliberately made workhouse life as uncomfortable as possible.
In the novel, this attitude is conveyed in Bitzer response to Gradgrind appeal for compassion.
Dickens was appalled by what he saw as selfish philosophy, which was combined with materialist laissez faire capitalism in the education of some children at the time, as well as in industrial practices.
In Dickens interpretation, the prevalence of utilitarian values in educational institutions promoted contempt between mill owners and workers, creating young adults whose imaginations had been neglected, due to an over emphasis on facts at the expense of more imaginative pursuits.
Dickens wished to satirise radical Utilitarians whom he described in letter to Charles Knight as "see figures and averages, and nothing else."
He also wished to campaign for reform of working conditions.
Dickens had visited factories in Manchester as early as and was appalled by the environment in which workers toiled.
Drawing upon his own childhood experiences, Dickens resolved to "strike the heaviest blow in my power" for those who laboured in horrific conditions.
John Stuart Mill had similar, rigorous education to that of Louisa Gradgrind, consisting of analytical, logical, mathematical, and statistical exercises.
In his twenties, Mill had nervous breakdown, believing his capacity for emotion had been enervated by his father stringent emphasis on analysis and mathematics in his education.
In the book, Louisa herself follows parallel course, being unable to express herself and falling into temporary depression as result of her dry education.
The bastion of fact is the eminently practical Mr. Gradgrind, and his model school, which teaches nothing but "Facts".
Any imaginative or aesthetic subjects are absent from the curriculum, and analysis, deduction and mathematics are emphasised.
Fancy, the opposite of Fact, is epitomised by Sleary circus.
Sleary is reckoned fool by Gradgrind and Bounderby, but it is Sleary who understands that people must be amused.
Sissy, the circus performer daughter, does badly at school, failing to remember the many facts she is taught, but is genuinely virtuous and fulfilled.
Gradgrind own son Tom revolts against his upbringing, and becomes gambler and thief, while Louisa becomes emotionally stunted, virtually soulless both as young child and as an unhappily married woman.
Bitzer, who adheres to Gradgrind teachings, becomes an uncompassionate egotist.
Mr. Bounderby spends his whole time fabricating stories about his childhood, covering up the real nature of his upbringing, which is revealed at the end of the novel.
While not snooper himself, he is undone by Sparsit unwittingly revealing the mysterious old woman to be his own mother, and she unravels Josiah secrets about his upbringing and fictitious stories.
Mr. Bounderby himself superintends through calculating tabular statements and statistics, and is always secretly rebuking the people of Coketown for indulging in conceitful activities.
This gives Bounderby sense of superiority, as it does with Mrs. Sparsit, who prides herself on her salacious knowledge gained from spying on others.
Bounderby grasp for superiority is seen in Blackpool talks to Bounderby regarding divorce proceedings and union movement at his factory, accusing him that he is on quest 'to feast on turtle soup and venison, served with golden spoon.'
All "superintendents" of the novel are undone in one way or another.
Dickens portrays the wealthy in this novel as being morally corrupt.
Bounderby has no moral scruples, and, for example, fires Blackpool "for novelty".
He also conducts himself without any shred of decency, frequently losing his temper.
He is cynically false about his childhood.
Harthouse, leisured gent, is compared to an "iceberg" who will cause wreck unwittingly, due to him being "not moral sort of fellow", as he states himself.
Stephen Blackpool, destitute worker, is equipped with perfect morals, always abiding by his promises, and always thoughtful and considerate of others, as is Sissy Jupe.
The role of status on morality
Dickens is also concerned, throughout Hard Times, with the effects of social class on the morality of individuals.
Some contrasting characters relating to this theme are Stephen and Rachel, and Tom and Mr. Bounderby.
Stephen honesty and Rachel caring actions are qualities not shown in people from higher classes, but among hard working individuals who are browbeaten by the uncaring factory owners such as Bounderby.
These qualities appear repeatedly, as Stephen works hard every day, until he decides to leave town to save the names of his fellow workers, and Rachel supports Stephen through this, while struggling to provide for herself as well.
In contrast to these behaviours, Mr. Bounderby refuses to recognise the difficulties faced by those in lower classes, as seen by him completely casting aside Stephen request for help.
Other aristocratic characters simply carry out blatantly immoral actions, such as Tom throwing away his sister money, falling into debt, then robbing bank, and even framing someone else for his actions.
Tom is also seen to be deceitful as he is able to keep his guilt hidden until the evidence points only toward him.
On the contrary, when the news comes out that Stephen had robbed the bank, Stephen begins to head back to Coketown to face his problems and clear his name.
Overall, the stark difference in morality between characters of dissimilar social status suggests Dickens' idea that there is form of innate natural law that may remain unhampered in those leading less titled lives.
Stephen concept of right and wrong is untainted by the manufactured values of utilitarianism, instilled into Tom and Bounderby.
George Bernard Shaw was critical of the book message.

Critics have had diverse opinions on the novel.
John Ruskin declared Hard Times to be his favourite Dickens work due to its exploration of important social questions.
However, Thomas Macaulay branded it "sullen socialism", on the grounds that Dickens did not fully comprehend the politics of the time.
George Bernard Shaw argued Hard Times to be novel of "passionate revolt against the whole industrial order of the modern world."
But he criticised the novel for failing to provide an accurate account of trade unionism of the time, arguing that Slackbridge, the poisonous orator, was "a mere figment of middle class imagination."
Believing that it was very different from Dickens other novels, Shaw also said: "Many readers find the change disappointing.
Others find Dickens worth reading almost for the first time."
F. R. Leavis, in The Great Tradition, described the book as essentially moral fable, and that 'of all Dickens' works (it is) the one that has all the strengths of his genius that of completely serious work of art'.
This, however, was view which he later revised in Dickens the Novelist, which recognised that Dickens strengths and artistry appeared fully in other works.
Walter Allen characterised Hard Times as being an unsurpassed "critique of industrial society", which was later superseded by works of D. H. Lawrence.
Other writers have described the novel as being, as G. K. Chesterton commented in his work Appreciations and Criticisms, "the harshest of his stories"; whereas George Orwell praised the novel (and Dickens himself) for "generous anger".
The novel was adapted as silent film, Hard Times, directed by Thomas Bentley.
In Portuguese director João Botelho adapted the novel to the big screen in Hard Times (shot entirely in black white) transferring the action to an unspecified industrial Portuguese city of the .
Hard Times has been adapted twice for BBC Radio, first in starring John Woodvine as Gradgrind, Tom Baker as Josiah Bounderby and Anna Massey as Mrs. Sparsit, and again in starring Kenneth Cranham as Gradgrind, Philip Jackson as Bounderby, Alan Williams as Stephen, Becky Hindley as Rachael, Helen Longworth as Louisa, Richard Firth as Tom and Eleanor Bron as Mrs. Sparsit.
In the theatre, Hard Times was adapted for the stage by Michael O'Brien and directed by Marti Maraden at Canada National Arts Centre in .
In Northern Broadsides toured an adaptation written by Deb McAndrew and directed by Conrad Nelson.
The novel has also been adapted twice as mini series for British television, once in with Patrick Allen as Gradgrind, Timothy West as Bounderby, Rosalie Crutchley as Mrs. Sparsit and Edward Fox as Harthouse, and again in with Bob Peck as Gradgrind, Alan Bates as Bounderby, Dilys Laye as Mrs. Sparsit, Bill Paterson as Stephen, Harriet Walter as Rachael and Richard E. Grant as Harthouse.
