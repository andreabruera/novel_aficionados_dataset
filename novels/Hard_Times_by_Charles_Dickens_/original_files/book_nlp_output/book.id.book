The name of that lady by the teapot , is Mrs. Sparsit . That lady acts as mistress of this house , and she is a highly connected lady . Consequently , if ever you come again into any room in this house , you will make a short stay in it if you do n't behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner . So far from having high connections I have no connections at all , and I come of the scum of the earth . But towards that lady , I do care what you do ; and you shall do what is deferential and respectful , or you shall not come here .

We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear 'em out now , for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland .

And now you know the place . ' ","i":55345},{"w":"` it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man , particularly with a public man , when I make his acquaintance . I have only one thing more to say to you , Mr. Harthouse , before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall respond , to the utmost of my poor ability , to my friend Tom Gradgrind 's letter of introduction . You are a man of family . Do n't you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family . I am a bit of dirty riff-raff , and a genuine scrap of tag , rag , and bobtail .

Mr. Harthouse has joined your father 's muster-roll . If he is not Tom Gradgrind 's colleague before long , I believe we shall at least hear of him in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns . I do n't know what she saw in me to marry me , but she saw something in me , I suppose , or she would n't have married me .

I have seen a little , here and there , up and down ; I have found it all to be very worthless , as everybody has , and as some confess they have , and some do not ; and I am going in for your respected father 's opinions - really because I have no choice of opinions , and may as well back them as anything else .

Oh , my fellow - countrymen , what warning but this did I give you ? Oh , you Englishmen , I ask you how does this subornation show in one of yourselves , who is thus consenting to his own undoing and to yours , and to your children 's and your children 's children 's ? ' ","i":61876},{"w":"` what 's this I hear ? What have these pests of the earth been doing to you ? A tea-table was set out ; and Mr. Bounderby 's young wife , and her brother , and a great gentleman from London , were present . Come in , and speak up . ' ","i":63791},{"w":"` This is the man I was telling you about , Harthouse , ' ","i":63918},{"w":"` speak up !

Now , you 'll think this pretty well , Harthouse , ' ","i":64406},{"w":"` You 'll think this tolerably strong . You shall hear me ask this man a question . Mr. Blackpool ' ","i":64451},{"w":"` how it happens .

' ","i":65555},{"w":"` Of course , ' ","i":65861},{"w":"` Now perhaps you 'll let the gentleman know , how you would set this muddle -LRB- as you 're so fond of calling it -RRB- to rights .

Do n't tell me we wo n't , man , ' ","i":65979},{"w":"` because we will , I tell you ! ' ","i":66013},{"w":"` I told you , the last time you were here with a grievance , that you had better turn about and come out of that .

' ","i":79196},{"w":"` Have you heard ? ' ","i":79214},{"w":"` Then you have n't heard ! ' ","i":79272},{"w":"` Of much ? ' ","i":79333},{"w":"` Why , no ; not of very much . Oh ! as a sum - if you stick to a sum - of not more than a hundred and fifty pound , ' ","i":79360},{"w":"` But it might have been . ' ","i":79400},{"w":"` Thank ` ee , ' ","i":79536},{"w":"` But I tell you what . It might have been twenty thousand pound . ' ","i":79552},{"w":"` Suppose it might ! By the Lord , you may suppose so . By George ! ' ","i":79575},{"w":"` It might have been twice twenty . There 's no knowing what it would have been , or would n't have been , as it was , but for the fellows ' ","i":79607},{"w":"` Dropped , sir , as if she was shot when I told her ! Never knew her do such a thing before . Does her credit , under the circumstances , in my opinion ! ' ","i":79682},{"w":"` Not if I knew it . ' ","i":80070},{"w":"` That sum of money , young Tom locked in his safe , not a very strong safe , but that 's no matter now . Some time in the night , while this young fellow snored - Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , you say you have heard him snore ? ' ","i":80090},{"w":"` Well ! ' ","i":80276},{"w":"` while he was snoring , or choking , or Dutch-clocking , or something or other - being asleep - some fellows , somehow , whether previously concealed in the house or not remains to be seen , got to young Tom 's safe , forced it , and abstracted the contents . Being then disturbed , they made off ; letting themselves out at the main door , and double-locking it again -LRB- it was double-locked , and the key under Mrs. Sparsit 's pillow -RRB- with a false key , which was picked up in the street near the Bank , about twelve o'clock to-day . No alarm takes place , till this chap , Bitzer , turns out this morning , and begins to open and prepare the offices for business . Everything was left , all right . Far from it . Then , looking at Tom 's safe , he sees the door ajar , and finds the lock forced , and the money gone . ' ","i":80285},{"w":"` and stays behind at the Bank . They would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job ; I can tell 'em that . ' ","i":80485},{"w":"` Suspected ? I should think there was somebody suspected . Egod ! ' ","i":80540},{"w":"` I 'll tell you . It 's not to be mentioned everywhere ; it 's not to be mentioned anywhere : in order that the scoundrels concerned -LRB- there 's a gang of 'em -RRB- may be thrown off their guard . So take this in confidence . Now wait a bit . ' ","i":80612},{"w":"` What should you say to ; ' ","i":80674},{"w":"` to a Hand being in it ? ' ","i":80687},{"w":"` I hope , ' ","i":80696},{"w":"` Say Pool instead of Pot , sir , ' ","i":80713},{"w":"` and that 's the man . ' ","i":80726},{"w":"` I can read 'em off , like books . What warning did I give that fellow , the first time he set foot in the house , when the express object of his visit was to know how he could knock Religion over , and floor the Established Church ? Mrs. Sparsit , in point of high connexions , you are on a level with the aristocracy , - did I say , or did I not say , to that fellow , `` you ca n't hide the truth from me Mrs. Sparsit , ma'am , I appeal to you . : you are not the kind of fellow I like ; you 'll come to no good '' ? ' ","i":80888},{"w":"` when he shocked your feelings ? ' ","i":81050},{"w":"` You can recall for yourself , Harthouse , what I said to him when you saw him . I did n't mince the matter with him . Went off , nobody knows where : as my mother did in my infancy - only with this difference , that he is a worse subject than my mother , if possible . I am never mealy with 'em . I KNOW 'em . Very well , sir . Three days after that , he bolted . What did he do before he went ? What do you say ; ' ","i":81167},{"w":"` to his being seen - night after night - watching the Bank ? - to his lurking about there - after dark ? - To its striking Mrs. Sparsit - that he could be lurking for no good - To her calling Bitzer 's attention to him , and their both taking notice of him - And to its appearing on inquiry to-day - that he was also noticed by the neighbours ? ' ","i":81297},{"w":"` I think so . But there are more of 'em in it . One never hears of these things till the mischief 's done ; all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen ; there 's an old woman turns up now . There 's an old woman . An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick , every now and then . She watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins , and on the night when you saw him , she steals away with him and holds a council with him - I suppose , to make her report on going off duty , and be damned to her . ' ","i":81421},{"w":"` Try a hand at backgammon , sir , as you used to do when I had the honour of living under your roof . ' ","i":82560},{"w":"` since that time .

' ","i":103547},{"w":"` leave me to get it out . Tom Gradgrind , Mrs. Sparsit latterly found herself , by accident , in a situation to overhear a conversation out of doors between your daughter and your precious gentleman-friend , Mr. James Harthouse . ' ","i":103571},{"w":"` Perhaps , ' ","i":103679},{"w":"` My dear Bounderby , let me beg you to restrain these loud out - breaks , on all accounts . The moment she could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak , and whom I deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you , Louisa hurried here , for protection . Louisa is here . I myself had not been at home many hours , when I received her - here , in this room . She hurried by the train to town , she ran from town to this house , through a raging storm , and presented herself before me in a state of distraction . Of course , she has remained here ever since . Let me entreat you , for your own sake and for hers , to be more quiet . ' ","i":103727},{"w":"` without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family , what I have got to add to that , is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge , namely , a coach . And the coach in which we came here being at the door , you 'll allow me to hand you down to it , and pack you home to the Bank : where the best course for you to pursue , will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear , and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed . ' ","i":104004},{"w":"` but I do n't want to be too dear . That , to start with . When I begin to be dear to a man , I generally find that his intention is to come over me . I am not speaking to you politely ; but , as you are aware , I am not polite . If you like politeness , you know where to get it . You have your gentleman-friends , you know , and they 'll serve you with as much of the article as you want . I do n't keep it myself .

I shall not associate him in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement ; pray do not persist in connecting him with mine . ' ","i":104487},{"w":"` I never mentioned his name !

I know the bricks of this town , and I know the works of this town , and I know the chimneys of this town , and I know the smoke of this town , and I know the Hands of this town . When a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities , I always tell that man , whoever he is , that I know what he means . He means turtle soup and venison , with a gold spoon , and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six . Since you are of opinion that she ought to have what she wants , I recommend you to provide it for her . I know 'em all pretty well . They 're real . That 's what your daughter wants . Because , Tom Gradgrind , she will never have it from me . ' ","i":105308},{"w":"` Just wait a bit , ' ","i":105512},{"w":"` you have said your say , I believe . Do n't make yourself a spectacle of unfairness as well as inconsistency , because , although I am sorry to see Tom Gradgrind reduced to his present position , I should be doubly sorry to see him brought so low as that .

I 'll give you to understand , in reply to that , that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude - to be summed up in this - that your daughter do n't properly know her husband 's merits , and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her , by George ! of the honour of his alliance . That 's plain speaking , I hope . ' ","i":105522},{"w":"` Is it ? ' ","i":105702},{"w":"` I am glad to hear you say so . Because when Tom Gradgrind , with his new lights , tells me that what I say is unreasonable , I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible . You know my origin ; and you know that for a good many years of my life I did n't want a shoeing-horn , in consequence of not having a shoe . Yet you may believe or not , as you think proper , that there are ladies - born ladies - belonging to families - Families ! - who next to worship the ground I walk on .

' ","i":105850},{"w":"` Hear me out , ' ","i":105934},{"w":"` and refrain from cutting in till your turn comes round . I say this , because highly connected females have been astonished to see the way in which your daughter has conducted herself , and to witness her insensibility . They have wondered how I have suffered it . And I wonder myself now , and I wo n't suffer it .

To tell you the truth , I do n't think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject . Now , I do n't want to make a quarrel of it with you , Tom Gradgrind . As to your gentleman-friend , he may take himself off , wherever he likes best . If he falls in my way , I shall tell him my mind ; if he do n't fall in my way , I sha n't , for it wo n't be worth my while to do it . As to your daughter , whom I made Loo Bounderby , and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind , if she do n't come home to-morrow , by twelve o'clock at noon , I shall understand that she prefers to stay away , and I shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here , and you 'll take charge of her for the future . What I shall say to people in general , of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law , will be this . I am Josiah Bounderby , and I had my bringing - up ; she 's the daughter of Tom Gradgrind , and she had her bringing - up ; and the two horses would n't pull together . I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man , I believe ; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common , also , who , in the long run , would come up to my mark .

At five minutes past twelve o'clock next day , he directed Mrs. Bounderby 's property to be carefully packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind 's ; advertised his country retreat for sale by private contract ; and resumed a bachelor life . CHAPTER IV - LOST THE robbery at the Bank had not languished before , and did not cease to occupy a front place in the attention of the principal of that establishment now . In boastful proof of his promptitude and activity , as a remarkable man , and a self-made man , and a commercial wonder more admirable than Venus , who had risen out of the mud instead of the sea , he liked to show how little his domestic affairs abated his business ardour . Consequently , in the first few weeks of his resumed bachelorhood , he even advanced upon his usual display of bustle , and every day made such a rout in renewing his investigations into the robbery , that the officers who had it in hand almost wished it had never been committed .

When they 're quite satisfied , perhaps they 'll be so good as to disperse ; whether they 're satisfied or not , perhaps they 'll be so good as to disperse . I 'm not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs , I have not undertaken to do it , and I 'm not a going to do it . Therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject , will be disappointed - particularly Tom Gradgrind , and he ca n't know it too soon . In reference to the Bank robbery , there has been a mistake made , concerning my mother . If there had n't been over-officiousness it would n't have been made , and I hate over-officiousness at all times , whether or no . Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms , holding the door open for the company to depart , there was a blustering sheepishness upon him , at once extremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd . Detected as the Bully of humility , who had built his windy reputation upon lies , and in his boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him as if he had advanced the mean claim -LRB- there is no meaner -RRB- to tack himself on to a pedigree , he cut a most ridiculous figure . With the people filing off at the door he held , who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole town , to be given to the four winds , he could not have looked a Bully more shorn and forlorn , if he had had his ears cropped . Even that unlucky female , Mrs. Sparsit , fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into the Slough of Despond , was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man and self-made Humbug , Josiah Bounderby of Coketown . Rachael and Sissy , leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her son 's for that night , walked together to the gate of Stone Lodge and there parted . Mr. Gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far , and spoke with much interest of Stephen Blackpool ; for whom he thought this signal failure of the suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well .

' ","i":40601},{"w":"` The course you pursued , you pursued according to the system - the system - and there is no more to be said about it . I can only suppose that the circumstances of your early life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers , and that we began too late . I wish I could have made a better acknowledgment , sir , of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you , and of your protection of her . ' ","i":40698},{"w":"` Do n't shed tears , ' ","i":40789},{"w":"` No . Still , as I have said already , I am disappointed .

If your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been more successful , you would have been wiser on these points . He really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her ; otherwise he held her calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he must have fallen upon that conclusion . Somehow or other , he had become possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could hardly be set forth in a tabular form . Her capacity of definition might be easily stated at a very low figure , her mathematical knowledge at nothing ; yet he was not sure that if he had been required , for example , to tick her off into columns in a parliamentary return , he would have quite known how to divide her . I have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle . Well ! I will say no more . ' ","i":40953},{"w":"` Dear me ! ' ","i":41378},{"w":"` My dear , ' ","i":41510},{"w":"` I must speak with you alone and seriously . Come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow , will you ?

As he now leaned back in his chair , and bent his deep-set eyes upon her in his turn , perhaps he might have seen one wavering moment in her , when she was impelled to throw herself upon his breast , and give him the pent-up confidences of her heart . But , to see it , he must have overleaped at a bound the artificial barriers he had for many years been erecting , between himself and all those subtle essences of humanity which will elude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be sounded The rest , my dear Louisa , is for you to decide . ' ","i":43981},{"w":"` Are you consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works , Louisa ? ' ","i":44213},{"w":"` The barriers were too many and too high for such a leap . There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke . Yet when the night comes , Fire bursts out , father ! ' ","i":44227},{"w":"` I speak of my own life , father . ' ","i":44405},{"w":"` I need not point out to you , Louisa , that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate . ' ","i":44423},{"w":"` How , matter ? The question I have to ask myself is , shall I marry him ? That is so , father , is it not ? You have told me so , father . Have you not ? ' ","i":44531},{"w":"` None , father . What does it matter !

Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable man ; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you - if any - is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired . It has always been my object so to educate you , as that you might , while still in your early youth , be -LRB- if I may so express myself -RRB- almost any age . Kiss me , my dear girl . ' ","i":45127},{"w":"` Be buoyant , sir ! ' ","i":90983},{"w":"` What is the matter ? How strange you look ! And good Heaven , ' ","i":94313},{"w":"` have you come here exposed to this storm ?

' ","i":94443},{"w":"` if I see reason to mistrust myself for the past , Louisa , I should also mistrust myself for the present and the future .

I am far from feeling convinced now , however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday , that I am fit for the trust you repose in me ; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me ; that I have the right instinct - supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature - how to help you , and to set you right , my child .
