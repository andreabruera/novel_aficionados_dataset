<p/>* Daisy Miller, by Henry James January, 1997 -LSB-Etext #786-RSB- Corrected EDITIONS of our etexts get a new NUMBER, hardt11.txt. VERSIONS based on separate sources get new LETTER, hardt10a.txt.
<p/>We are now trying to release all our books one month in advance of the official release dates, for time for better editing.
<p/>Please note: neither this list nor its contents are final till midnight of the last day of the month of any such announcement.
<p/>Midnight, Central Time, of the last day of the stated month. A preliminary version may often be posted for suggestion, comment and editing by those who wish to do so.
<p/>To be sure you have an up to date first edition -LSB-xxxxx10x.xxx-RSB- please check file sizes in the first week of the next month.
<p/>a look at the file size will have to do, but we will try to see a new copy has at least one byte more or less.
<p/>Since our ftp program has a bug in it that scrambles the date -LSB-tried to fix and failed-RSB- We produce about two million dollars for each hour we work.
<p/>If our value per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce $2 million dollars per hour this year as we release thirty-two text files per month: or 400 more Etexts in 1996 for a total of 800.
<p/>The fifty hours is one conservative estimate for how long it we take projected audience is one hundred million readers. If these reach just 10% of the computerized population, then the total should reach 80 billion Etexts.
<p/>We will try add 800 more, during 1997, but it will take all the effort we can manage to do the doubling of our library again this year, what with the other massive requirements it is going to take to get incorporated and establish something that will have some permanence.
<p/>This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers, which is only 10% of the present number of computer users.
<p/>2001 should have at least twice as many computer users as that, so it will require us reaching less than 5% of the users in 2001.

<p/>THE FIRST - SOWING CHAPTER I - THE ONE THING NEEDFUL <div class="bookquote">` NOW, what I want is, Facts. Teach these boys and girls nothing but Facts.
<p/>You can only form the minds of reasoning animals upon Facts: nothing else will ever be of any service to them.
<p/>This is the principle on which I bring up my own children, and this is the principle on which I bring up these children.
<p/>The scene was a plain, bare, monotonous vault of a school-room, and the speaker's square forefinger emphasized his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) observations by underscoring every sentence with a line on the schoolmaster's sleeve.
<p/>The emphasis was helped by the speaker's square wall of a forehead, which had his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) eyebrows for its base, while his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves, overshadowed by the wall.
<p/>Facts alone are wanted in life. Plant nothing else, and root out everything else. Stick to Facts, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The emphasis was helped by the speaker's mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set.
<p/>The emphasis was helped by the speaker's hair, which bristled on the skirts of his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside.
<p/>The speaker's obstinate carriage, square coat, square legs, square shoulders, - nay, his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) very neckcloth, trained to take him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) by the throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it was, - all helped the emphasis. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The emphasis was helped by the speaker's voice, which was inflexible, dry, and dictatorial. In this life, we want nothing but Facts, sir; nothing but Facts!'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The speaker, and the schoolmaster, and the third grown person present, all backed a little, and swept with their eyes the inclined plane of little vessels then and there arranged in order, ready to have imperial gallons of facts poured into them until they were full to the brim.
<p/>A man who proceeds upon the principle that two and two are four, and nothing over, and who is not to be talked into allowing for anything over.
<p/>CHAPTER II - MURDERING THE INNOCENTS THOMAS GRADGRIND, sir. A man of realities. A man of facts and calculations. Thomas Gradgrind, sir - peremptorily Thomas - Thomas Gradgrind.
<p/>With a rule and a pair of scales, and the multiplication table always in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) pocket, sir, ready to weigh and measure any parcel of human nature, and tell you exactly what it comes to.
<p/>You might hope to get some other nonsensical belief into the head of George Gradgrind, or Augustus Gradgrind, or John Gradgrind, or Joseph Gradgrind -LRB-all supposititious, non-existent persons-RRB-, but into the head of Thomas Gradgrind - no, sir!
<p/>In such terms Mr. Gradgrind always mentally introduced himself, whether to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) private circle of acquaintance, or to the public in general.
<p/>In such terms, no doubt, substituting the words <div class="bookquote">`boys and girls,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>for <div class="bookquote">`sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Thomas Gradgrind now presented Thomas Gradgrind to the little pitchers before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), who were to be filled so full of facts.
<p/>Indeed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) eagerly sparkled at them from the cellarage before mentioned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) seemed a kind of cannon loaded to the muzzle with facts, and prepared to blow them clean out of the regions of childhood at one discharge.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) seemed a galvanizing apparatus, too, charged with a grim mechanical substitute for the tender young imaginations that were to be stormed away. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is a mere question of figures, a case of simple arithmetic. Girl number twenty,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, squarely pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) square forefinger, <div class="bookquote">`I don't know that girl.
<p/>Who is that girl?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Sissy Jupe, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>explained number twenty, blushing, standing up, and curtseying. <div class="bookquote">` Sissy is not a name,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't call yourself Sissy. Call yourself Cecilia.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It's father as calls me Sissy, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>returned the young girl in a trembling voice, and with another curtsey. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) has no business to do it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) mustn't. Cecilia Jupe. Let me see.
<p/>What is your father?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) belongs to the horse-riding, if you please, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gradgrind frowned, and waved off the objectionable calling with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We don't want to know anything about that, here. You mustn't tell us about that, here. Your father breaks horses, don't he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`If you please, sir, when they can get any to break, they do break horses in the ring, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You mustn't tell us about the ring, here.
<p/>Very well, then. Describe your father as a horsebreaker. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doctors sick horses, I dare say?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh yes, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Very well, then.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is a veterinary surgeon, a farrier, and horsebreaker. Give me your definition of a horse.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Sissy Jupe thrown into the greatest alarm by this demand.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Girl number twenty unable to define a horse!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, for the general behoof of all the little pitchers. `
<p/>Girl number twenty possessed of no facts, in reference to one of the commonest of animals! Some boy's definition of a horse.
<p/>The square finger, moving here and there, lighted suddenly on Bitzer, perhaps because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) chanced to sit in the same ray of sunlight which, darting in at one of the bare windows of the intensely white-washed room, irradiated Sissy.
<p/>For, the boys and girls sat on the face of the inclined plane in two compact bodies, divided up the centre by a narrow interval; and Sissy, being at the corner of a row on the sunny side, came in for the beginning of a sunbeam, of which Bitzer, being at the corner of a row on the other side, a few rows in advance, caught the end.
<p/>But, whereas the girl was so dark-eyed and dark-haired, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed to receive a deeper and more lustrous colour from the sun, when it shone upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), the boy was so light-eyed and light-haired that the self-same rays appeared to draw out of him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) what little colour he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) ever possessed.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) cold eyes would hardly have been eyes, but for the short ends of lashes which, by bringing them into immediate contrast with something paler than themselves, expressed their form.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) skin was so unwholesomely deficient in the natural tinge, that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) looked as though, if he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) were cut, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) would bleed white. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bitzer, yours.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) short-cropped hair might have been a mere continuation of the sandy freckles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) forehead and face. Bitzer,' said Thomas Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your definition of a horse.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Quadruped. Graminivorous. Forty teeth, namely twenty-four grinders, four eye-teeth, and twelve incisive. Sheds coat in the spring; in marshy countries, sheds hoofs, too.
<p/>Hoofs hard, but requiring to be shod with iron. Age known by marks in mouth.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>Thus -LRB-and much more-RRB- Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) curtseyed again, and would have blushed deeper, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) could have blushed deeper than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) had blushed all this time.
<p/>Bitzer, after rapidly blinking at Thomas Gradgrind with both eyes at once, and so catching the light upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) quivering ends of lashes that they looked like the antennae of busy insects, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) knuckles to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) freckled forehead, and sat down again.
<p/>A mighty man at cutting and drying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) was; a government officer; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) way -LRB-and in most other people's too-RRB-, a professed pugilist; always in training, always with a system to force down the general throat like a bolus, always to be heard of at the bar of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) little Public-office, ready to fight all England.
<p/>To continue in fistic phraseology, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) had a genius for coming up to the scratch, wherever and whatever it was, and proving himself an ugly customer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) would go in and damage any subject whatever with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) right, follow up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) left, stop, exchange, counter, bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) opponent -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) always fought All England-RRB- to the ropes, and fall upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) neatly.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) was certain to knock the wind out of common sense, and render that unlucky adversary deaf to the call of time.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>adversary</b></font>) had it in charge from high authority to bring about the great public-office Millennium, when Commissioners should reign upon earth.
<p/>Now girl number twenty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` You know what a horse is.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>The third gentleman now stepped forth. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Very well,'  (<font color='red'><b>The gentleman</b></font>)</div>said this gentleman, briskly smiling, and folding his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms. <div class="bookquote">` That's a horse. Now, let me ask you girls and boys, Would you paper a room with representations of horses?'
 (<font color='red'><b>this gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>After a pause, one half of the children cried in chorus, <div class="bookquote">`Yes, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>the children</b></font>)</div>Upon which the other half, seeing in the gentleman's face that Yes was wrong, cried out in chorus, <div class="bookquote">`No, sir!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>One corpulent slow boy, with a wheezy manner of breathing, ventured the answer, Because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wouldn't paper a room at all, but would paint it. `
<p/>- as the custom is, in these examinations. <div class="bookquote">` Of course, No. Why wouldn't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A pause. You must paper it,' said the gentleman, rather warmly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You must paper it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Thomas Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`whether you like it or not. Don't tell us you wouldn't paper it. What do you mean, boy?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll explain to you, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman paper</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, after another and a dismal pause, <div class="bookquote">`why you wouldn't paper a room with representations of horses.
<p/>Do you ever see horses walking up and down the sides of rooms in reality - in fact? Do you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman paper</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from one half. <div class="bookquote">`No, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from the other. <div class="bookquote">` Of course no,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, with an indignant look at the wrong half. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, then, you are not to see anywhere, what you don't see in fact; you are not to have anywhere, what you don't have in fact.
<p/>What is called Taste, is only another name for Fact.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>Thomas Gradgrind nodded his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) approbation. <div class="bookquote">` This is a new principle, a discovery, a great discovery,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, I'll try you again. Suppose you were going to carpet a room. Would you use a carpet having a representation of flowers upon it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>There being a general conviction by this time that <div class="bookquote">`No, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>this gentleman</b></font>)</div>was always the right answer to this gentleman, the chorus of NO was very strong.
<p/>Only a few feeble stragglers said Yes: among them Sissy Jupe. <div class="bookquote">` Girl number twenty,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, smiling in the calm strength of knowledge.
<p/>So you would carpet your room - or your husband's room, if you were a grown woman, and had a husband - with representations of flowers, would you?' said the gentleman. `
<p/>Sissy blushed, and stood up. <div class="bookquote">` Why would you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`If you please, sir, I am very fond of flowers,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>returned the girl. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And is that why you would put tables and chairs upon them, and have people walking over them with heavy boots?'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>`It wouldn't hurt them, sir.
<p/>They wouldn't crush and wither, if you please, sir. They would be the pictures of what was very pretty and pleasant, and I would fancy - ` <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ay, ay, ay! But you mustn't fancy,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried the gentleman, quite elated by coming so happily to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) point. <div class="bookquote">` That's it!
<p/>You are never to fancy.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You are not, Cecilia Jupe,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Thomas Gradgrind solemnly repeated, <div class="bookquote">`to do anything of that kind.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Fact, fact, fact!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman. And <div class="bookquote">`Fact, fact, fact!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>repeated Thomas Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` You are to be in all things regulated and governed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`by fact.
<p/>We hope to have, before long, a board of fact, composed of commissioners of fact, who will force the people to be a people of fact, and of nothing but fact.
<p/>You must discard the word Fancy altogether. You have nothing to do with it. You are not to have, in any object of use or ornament, what would be a contradiction in fact.
<p/>You don't find that foreign birds and butterflies come and perch upon your crockery; you cannot be permitted to paint foreign birds and butterflies upon your crockery.
<p/>You don't walk upon flowers in fact; you cannot be allowed to walk upon flowers in carpets. You never meet with quadrupeds going up and down walls; you must not have quadrupeds represented upon walls.
<p/>You must use,'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`for all these purposes, combinations and modifications -LRB-in primary colours-RRB- of mathematical figures which are susceptible of proof and demonstration.
<p/>This is the new discovery. This is fact. This is taste.'  (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman</b></font>)</div>The girl curtseyed, and sat down. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was very young, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were frightened by the matter-of-fact prospect the world afforded. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, if Mr. M'Choakumchild,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the gentleman, <div class="bookquote">`will proceed to give his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) first lesson here, Mr. Gradgrind, I shall be happy, at your request, to observe his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) mode of procedure.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the gentleman Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gradgrind was much obliged. <div class="bookquote">` Mr. M'Choakumchild, we only wait for you.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>So, Mr. M'Choakumchild began in his (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) best manner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) and some one hundred and forty other schoolmasters, had been lately turned at the same time, in the same factory, on the same principles, like so many pianoforte legs.
<p/>Orthography, etymology, syntax, and prosody, biography, astronomy, geography, and general cosmography, the sciences of compound proportion, algebra, land-surveying and levelling, vocal music, and drawing from models, were all at the ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) ten chilled fingers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) had worked his (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) stony way into Her (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) Majesty's most Honourable Privy Council's Schedule B, and had taken the bloom off the higher branches of mathematics and physical science, French, German, Latin, and Greek.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) knew all about all the Water Sheds of all the world -LRB-whatever they are-RRB-, and all the histories of all the peoples, and all the names of all the rivers and mountains, and all the productions, manners, and customs of all the countries, and all their boundaries and bearings on the two and thirty points of the compass.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) had been put through an immense variety of paces, and had answered volumes of head-breaking questions. Ah, rather overdone, M'Choakumchild.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) went to work in this preparatory lesson, not unlike Morgiana in the Forty Thieves: looking into all the vessels ranged before him (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>), one after another, to see what they contained.
<p/>When from thy boiling store, thou shalt fill each jar brim full by-and-by, dost thou think that thou wilt always kill outright the robber Fancy lurking within - or sometimes only maim him (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) and distort him (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>)!
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) had only learnt a little less, how infinitely better he (<font color='blue'><b>robber</b></font>) might have taught much more! Say, good M'Choakumchild. CHAPTER III - A LOOPHOLE MR.
<p/>GRADGRIND walked homeward from the school, in a state of considerable satisfaction. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>GRADGRIND</b></font>) school, and he (<font color='blue'><b>GRADGRIND</b></font>) intended it to be a model.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>GRADGRIND</b></font>) intended every child in it to be a model - just as the young Gradgrinds were all models. There were five young Gradgrinds, and they were models every one.
<p/>They had been lectured at, from their tenderest years; coursed, like little hares. Almost as soon as they could run alone, they had been made to run to the lecture-room.
<p/>The first object with which they had an association, or of which they had a remembrance, was a large black board with a dry Ogre chalking ghastly white figures on it.
<p/>I only use the word to express a monster in a lecturing castle, with Heaven knows how many heads manipulated into one, taking childhood captive, and dragging it into gloomy statistical dens by the hair.
<p/>No little Gradgrind had ever seen a face in the moon; it was up in the moon before it could speak distinctly.
<p/>Not that they knew, by name or nature, anything about an Ogre Fact forbid! No little Gradgrind had ever learnt the silly jingle, Twinkle, twinkle, little star; how I wonder what you are!
<p/>No little Gradgrind had ever known wonder on the subject, each little Gradgrind having at five years old dissected the Great Bear like a Professor Owen, and driven Charles's Wain like a locomotive engine-driver.
<p/>No little Gradgrind had ever associated a cow in a field with that famous cow with the crumpled horn who tossed the dog who worried the cat who killed the rat who ate the malt, or with that yet more famous cow who swallowed Tom Thumb: it had never heard of those celebrities, and had only been introduced to a cow as a graminivorous ruminating quadruped with several stomachs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had virtually retired from the wholesale hardware trade before he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) built Stone Lodge, and was now looking about for a suitable opportunity of making an arithmetical figure in Parliament.
<p/>Stone Lodge was situated on a moor within a mile or two of a great town - called Coketown in the present faithful guide-book.
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) matter-of-fact home, which was called Stone Lodge, Mr. Gradgrind directed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) steps. A very regular feature on the face of the country, Stone Lodge was.
<p/>Not the least disguise toned down or shaded off that uncompromising fact in the landscape. A great square house, with a heavy portico darkening the principal windows, as its master's heavy brows overshadowed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Six windows on this side of the door, six on that side; a total of twelve in this wing, a total of twelve in the other wing; four-and-twenty carried over to the back wings.
<p/>A calculated, cast up, balanced, and proved house. A lawn and garden and an infant avenue, all ruled straight like a botanical account- book.
<p/>Iron clamps and girders, fire-proof from top to bottom; mechanical lifts for the housemaids, with all their brushes and brooms; everything that heart could desire.
<p/>Gas and ventilation, drainage and water-service, all of the primest quality. Everything? Well, I suppose so. The little Gradgrinds had cabinets in various departments of science too.
<p/>They had a little conchological cabinet, and a little metallurgical cabinet, and a little mineralogical cabinet; and the specimens were all arranged and labelled, and the bits of stone and ore looked as though they might have been broken from the parent substances by those tremendously hard instruments their own names; and, to paraphrase the idle legend of Peter Piper, who had never found his (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) way into their nursery, If the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped at more than this, what was it for good gracious goodness' sake, that the greedy little Gradgrinds grasped it!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) was an affectionate father, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) manner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) would probably have described himself -LRB-if he (<font color='blue'><b>Piper</b></font>) had been put, like Sissy Jupe, upon a definition-RRB- as <div class="bookquote">`an eminently practical'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>father.
<p/>Their father walked on in a hopeful and satisfied frame of mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a particular pride in the phrase eminently practical, which was considered to have a special application to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
<p/>Whatsoever the public meeting held in Coketown, and whatsoever the subject of such meeting, some Coketowner was sure to seize the occasion of alluding to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eminently practical friend Gradgrind.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had reached the neutral ground upon the outskirts of the town, which was neither town nor country, and yet was either spoiled, when his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ears were invaded by the sound of music.
<p/>The clashing and banging band attached to the horse-riding establishment, which had there set up its rest in a wooden pavilion, was in full bray.
<p/>A flag, floating from the summit of the temple, proclaimed to mankind that it was <div class="bookquote">`Sleary's Horse-riding'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>which claimed their suffrages.
<p/>Sleary himself, a stout modern statue with a money-box at its elbow, in an ecclesiastical niche of early Gothic architecture, took the money.
<p/>Miss Josephine Sleary, as some very long and very narrow strips of printed bill announced, was then inaugurating the entertainments with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act.
<p/>Among the other pleasing but always strictly moral wonders which must be seen to be believed, Signor Jupe was that afternoon to <div class="bookquote">`elucidate the diverting accomplishments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) highly trained performing dog Merrylegs.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Signor Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) was also to exhibit <div class="bookquote">`his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) astounding feat of throwing seventy-five hundred-weight in rapid succession backhanded over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) head, thus forming a fountain of solid iron in mid-air, a feat never before attempted in this or any other country, and which having elicited such rapturous plaudits from enthusiastic throngs it cannot be withdrawn.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>This always pleased the eminently practical friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) knew it to be his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) due, but his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) due was acceptable. The same Signor Jupe was to <div class="bookquote">`enliven the varied performances at frequent intervals with his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Signor Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/>Lastly, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was to wind them up by appearing in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) favourite character of Mr. William Button, of Tooley Street, in <div class="bookquote">`the highly novel and laughable hippo- comedietta of The Tailor's Journey to Brentford.'
 (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomas Gradgrind took no heed of these trivialities of course, but passed on as a practical man ought to pass on, either brushing the noisy insects from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts, or consigning them to the House of Correction.
<p/>But, the turning of the road took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by the back of the booth, and at the back of the booth a number of children were congregated in a number of stealthy attitudes, striving to peep in at the hidden glories of the place.
<p/>This brought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to a stop. <div class="bookquote">` Now, to think of these vagabonds,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`attracting the young rabble from a model school.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A space of stunted grass and dry rubbish being between him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) and the young rabble, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyeglass out of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waistcoat to look for any child he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew by name, and might order off.
<p/>Phenomenon almost incredible though distinctly seen, what did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then behold but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own metallurgical Louisa, peeping with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) might through a hole in a deal board, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own mathematical Thomas abasing himself on the ground to catch but a hoof of the graceful equestrian Tyrolean flower-act!
<p/>Dumb with amazement, Mr. Gradgrind crossed to the spot where his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) family was thus disgraced, laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hand upon each erring child, and said: <div class="bookquote">`Louisa!!
<p/>Thomas!!'  (<font color='red'><b>each child</b></font>)</div>Both rose, red and disconcerted. But, Louisa looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father with more boldness than Thomas did. Indeed, Thomas did not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), but gave himself up to be taken home like a machine. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>In the name of wonder, idleness, and folly!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, leading each away by a hand; <div class="bookquote">`what do you do here?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There was an air of jaded sullenness in them both, and particularly in the girl: yet, struggling through the dissatisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) face, there was a light with nothing to rest upon, a fire with nothing to burn, a starved imagination keeping life in itself somehow, which brightened its expression.
<p/>Not with the brightness natural to cheerful youth, but with uncertain, eager, doubtful flashes, which had something painful in them, analogous to the changes on a blind face groping its way.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was a child now, of fifteen or sixteen; but at no distant day would seem to become a woman all at once.
<p/>Wanted to see what it was like,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Louisa, shortly. <div class="bookquote">` What it was like?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, father.'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father thought so as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>).
<p/>Thomas, though I have the fact before me, I find it difficult to believe that you, with your education and resources, should have brought your sister to a scene like this.' `
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was pretty. Would have been self-willed -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eminently practical way-RRB- but for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bringing-up. <div class="bookquote">` I brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), father,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, quickly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to come.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I am sorry to hear it. I am very sorry indeed to hear it. It makes Thomas no better, and it makes you worse, Louisa.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Thomas and you, to whom the circle of the sciences is open; Thomas and you, who may be said to be replete with facts; Thomas and you, who have been trained to mathematical exactness; Thomas and you, here!' cried Mr. Gradgrind. `
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father again, but no tear fell down her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) cheek. <div class="bookquote">` You! In this degraded position! I am amazed.'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I was tired, father. I have been tired a long time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Louisa. <div class="bookquote">` Tired? Of what?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>asked the astonished father. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't know of what - of everything, I think.'  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Say not another word,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Gradgrind. ` You are childish.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) did not speak again until they had walked some half-a-mile in silence, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) gravely broke out with: <div class="bookquote">`What would your best friends say, Louisa?
<p/>I will hear no more.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Do you attach no value to their good opinion? What would Mr. Bounderby say?' At the mention of this name, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) daughter stole a look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), remarkable for its intense and searching character.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) saw nothing of it, for before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had again cast down her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) eyes! <div class="bookquote">` What,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) repeated presently, <div class="bookquote">`would Mr. Bounderby say?'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>All the way to Stone Lodge, as with grave indignation he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) led the two delinquents home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) repeated at intervals <div class="bookquote">`What would Mr. Bounderby say?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>- as if Mr. Bounderby had been Mrs. Grundy.
<p/>Why, Mr. Bounderby was as near being Mr. Gradgrind's bosom friend, as a man perfectly devoid of sentiment can approach that spiritual relationship towards another man perfectly devoid of sentiment.
<p/>CHAPTER IV - MR. BOUNDERBY NOT being Mrs. Grundy, who was Mr. Bounderby? So near was Mr. Bounderby - or, if the reader should prefer it, so far off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was a rich man: banker, merchant, manufacturer, and what not. A big, loud man, with a stare, and a metallic laugh.
<p/>A man with a great puffed head and forehead, swelled veins in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temples, and such a strained skin to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face that it seemed to hold his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes open, and lift his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyebrows up.
<p/>A man made out of a coarse material, which seemed to have been stretched to make so much of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). A man with a pervading appearance on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) of being inflated like a balloon, and ready to start.
<p/>A man who was always proclaiming, through that brassy speaking-trumpet of a voice of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old ignorance and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) old poverty.
<p/>A man who could never sufficiently vaunt himself a self-made man. A man who was the Bully of humility. A year or two younger than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eminently practical friend, Mr. Bounderby looked older;
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) seven or eight and forty might have had the seven or eight added to it again, without surprising anybody. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had not much hair.
<p/>One might have fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had talked it off; and that what was left, all standing up in disorder, was in that condition from being constantly blown about by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) windy boastfulness.
<p/>In the formal drawing-room of Stone Lodge, standing on the hearthrug, warming himself before the fire, Mr. Bounderby delivered some observations to Mrs. Gradgrind on the circumstance of its being his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) birthday.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) stood before the fire, partly because it was a cool spring afternoon, though the sun shone; partly because the shade of Stone Lodge was always haunted by the ghost of damp mortar; partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) thus took up a commanding position, from which to subdue Mrs. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I hadn't a shoe to my foot. As to a stocking, I didn't know such a thing by name. I passed the day in a ditch, and the night in a pigsty.
<p/>That's the way I spent my tenth birthday. Not that a ditch was new to me, for I was born in a ditch.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gradgrind, a little, thin, white, pink-eyed bundle of shawls, of surpassing feebleness, mental and bodily; who was always taking physic without any effect, and who, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) showed a symptom of coming to life, was invariably stunned by some weighty piece of fact tumbling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>); Mrs. Gradgrind hoped it was a dry ditch? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No! As wet as a sop. A foot of water in it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` Enough to give a baby cold,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Gradgrind considered. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I was born with inflammation of the lungs, and of everything else, I believe, that was capable of inflammation,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Cold? For years, ma'am, I was one of the most miserable little wretches ever seen. I was so sickly, that I was always moaning and groaning.
<p/>I was so ragged and dirty, that you wouldn't have touched me with a pair of tongs.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Gradgrind faintly looked at the tongs, as the most appropriate thing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) imbecility could think of doing. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How I fought through it, I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` I was determined, I suppose. I have been a determined character in later life, and I suppose I was then.
<p/>Here I am, Mrs. Gradgrind, anyhow, and nobody to thank for my being here, but myself.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Gradgrind meekly and weakly hoped that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) mother - <div class="bookquote">`My mother?
<p/>My mother left me to my grandmother,'  (<font color='red'><b>mother mother</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby; <div class="bookquote">`and, according to the best of my remembrance, my grandmother was the wickedest and the worst old woman that ever lived.
<p/>If I got a little pair of shoes by any chance, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would take 'em off and sell 'em for drink.
<p/>Why, I have known that grandmother of mine lie in her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) bed and drink her (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) four-teen glasses of liquor before breakfast!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gradgrind, weakly smiling, and giving no other sign of vitality, looked -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) always did-RRB- like an indifferently executed transparency of a small female figure, without enough light behind it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bolted, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby. Mrs. Gradgrind, stunned as usual, collapsed and gave it up. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) kept a chandler's shop,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>pursued Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`and kept me in an egg-box.
<p/>That was the cot of my infancy; an old egg-box. As soon as I was big enough to run away, of course I ran away.
<p/>Then I became a young vagabond; and instead of one old woman knocking me about and starving me, everybody of all ages knocked me about and starved me.
<p/>They were right; they had no business to do anything else. I was a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest. I know that very well.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) pride in having at any time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) life achieved such a great social distinction as to be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest, was only to be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I was to pull through it, I suppose, Mrs. Gradgrind. Whether I was to do it or not, ma'am, I did it.
<p/>I pulled through it, though nobody threw me out a rope. Vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk, chief manager, small partner, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.
<p/>Josiah Bounderby of Coketown learnt his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) letters from the outsides of the shops, Mrs. Gradgrind, and was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the steeple clock of St. Giles's Church, London, under the direction of a drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible vagrant.
<p/>Tell Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, of your district schools and your model schools, and your training schools, and your whole kettle-of-fish of schools; and Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, tells you plainly, all right, all correct - he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hadn't such advantages - but let us have hard-headed, solid-fisted people - the education that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) won't do for everybody, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) knows well - such and such his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) education was, however, and you may force him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) to swallow boiling fat, but you shall never force him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) to suppress the facts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) life.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Those are the antecedents, and the culmination. Being heated when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) arrived at this climax, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown stopped. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) stopped just as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) eminently practical friend, still accompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) eminently practical friend, on seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), stopped also, and gave Louisa a reproachful look that plainly said, <div class="bookquote">`Behold your Bounderby!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>blustered Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`what's the matter? What is young Thomas in the dumps about?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>And, Mrs. Gradgrind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) husband in a lofty manner, <div class="bookquote">`I should as soon have expected to find my children reading poetry.'
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>We were peeping at the circus,' muttered Louisa, haughtily, without lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">`and father caught us.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` Dear me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How can you, Louisa and Thomas! I wonder at you. I declare you're enough to make one regret ever having had a family at all.
<p/>I have a great mind to say I wish I hadn't. Then what would you have done, I should like to know?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>As if, with my head in its present throbbing state, you couldn't go and look at the shells and minerals and things provided for you, instead of circuses!' said Mrs. Gradgrind. `
<p/>You know, as well as I do, no young people have circus masters, or keep circuses in cabinets, or attend lectures about circuses.
<p/>Mr. Gradgrind did not seem favourably impressed by these cogent remarks. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) frowned impatiently. <div class="bookquote">` What can you possibly want to know of circuses then?
<p/>With my head in its present state, I couldn't remember the mere names of half the facts you have got to attend to.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>I am sure you have enough to do, if that's what you want. <div class="bookquote">` That's the reason!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>pouted Louisa. <div class="bookquote">` Don't tell me that's the reason, because it can't be nothing of the sort,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mrs. Gradgrind was not a scientific character, and usually dismissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) children to their studies with this general injunction to choose their pursuit.
<p/>In truth, Mrs. Gradgrind's stock of facts in general was woefully defective; but Mr. Gradgrind in raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) high matrimonial position, had been influenced by two reasons.
<p/>Go and be somethingological directly.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Firstly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was most satisfactory as a question of figures; and, secondly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">`no nonsense'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>about her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>).
<p/>By nonsense he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) meant fancy; and truly it is probable she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was as free from any alloy of that nature, as any human being not arrived at the perfection of an absolute idiot, ever was.
<p/>The simple circumstance of being left alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) husband and Mr. Bounderby, was sufficient to stun this admirable lady again without collision between herself and any other fact.
<p/>Bounderby,' said Mr. Gradgrind, drawing a chair to the fireside, `you are always so interested in my young people - particularly in Louisa - that I make no apology for saying to you, I am very much vexed by this discovery.
<p/>So, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) once more died away, and nobody minded her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` I have systematically devoted myself -LRB-as you know-RRB- to the education of the reason of my family.
<p/>And yet, Bounderby, it would appear from this unexpected circumstance of to-day, though in itself a trifling one, as if something had crept into Thomas's and Louisa's minds which is - or rather, which is not - I don't know that I can express myself better than by saying - which has never been intended to be developed, and in which their reason has no part.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>The reason is -LRB-as you know-RRB- the only faculty to which education should be addressed. <div class="bookquote">` There certainly is no reason in looking with interest at a parcel of vagabonds,'  (<font color='red'><b>the faculty</b></font>)</div>returned Bounderby. `
<p/>Then comes the question; said the eminently practical father, with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes on the fire, <div class="bookquote">`in what has this vulgar curiosity its rise?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>When I was a vagabond myself, nobody looked with any interest at me; I know that.' ` <div class="bookquote">`I'll tell you in what.
<p/>In idle imagination.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I hope not,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the eminently practical; <div class="bookquote">`I confess, however, that the misgiving has crossed me on my way home.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`In idle imagination, Gradgrind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>repeated Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` A very bad thing for anybody, but a cursed bad thing for a girl like Louisa.
<p/>I should ask Mrs. Gradgrind's pardon for strong expressions, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) knows very well I am not a refined character.
<p/>Whether,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Gradgrind, pondering with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) pockets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) cavernous eyes on the fire, <div class="bookquote">`whether any instructor or servant can have suggested anything?
<p/>Whoever expects refinement in me will be disappointed. I hadn't a refined bringing up.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Whether Louisa or Thomas can have been reading anything?
<p/>Because, in minds that have been practically formed by rule and line, from the cradle upwards, this is so curious, so incomprehensible.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>cried Bounderby, who all this time had been standing, as before, on the hearth, bursting at the very furniture of the room with explosive humility. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Whether, in spite of all precautions, any idle story-book can have got into the house? Stop a bit!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>You have one of those strollers' children in the school.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Cecilia Jupe, by name,'  (<font color='red'><b>strollers children</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, with something of a stricken look at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">` Now, stop a bit!'
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Bounderby again. <div class="bookquote">` How did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jupe</b></font>) come there?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why, the fact is, I saw the girl myself, for the first time, only just now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) specially applied here at the house to be admitted, as not regularly belonging to our town, and - yes, you are right,
<p/>Bounderby, you are right.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Now, stop a bit!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

(<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Louisa certainly did see her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) mentioned the application to me.
<p/>But Louisa saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), I have no doubt, in Mrs. Gradgrind's presence.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Pray, Mrs. Gradgrind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`what passed?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The girl wanted to come to the school, and Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come to the school, and Louisa and Thomas both said that the girl wanted to come, and that Mr. Gradgrind wanted girls to come, and how was it possible to contradict them when such was the fact!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Oh, my poor health!' returned Mrs. Gradgrind. ` <div class="bookquote">` Now I tell you what, Gradgrind!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` Turn this girl to the right about, and there's an end of it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I am much of your opinion.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Do it at once,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`has always been my motto from a child. When I thought I would run away from my egg-box and my grandmother, I did it at once.
<p/>Perhaps you would not mind walking to town with me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not the least in the world,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`as long as you do it at once!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>So, Mr. Bounderby threw on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hat - he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) always threw it on, as expressing a man who had been far too busily employed in making himself, to acquire any fashion of wearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hat - and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) pockets, sauntered out into the hall. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do you the same. Do this at once!'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Are you walking?'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>asked his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">` I have the father's address. I never wear gloves,'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) custom to say. `
<p/>Being left to saunter in the hall a minute or two while Mr. Gradgrind went up-stairs for the address, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) opened the door of the children's study and looked into that serene floor-clothed apartment, which, notwithstanding its book-cases and its cabinets and its variety of learned and philosophical appliances, had much of the genial aspect of a room devoted to hair-cutting.
<p/>Louisa languidly leaned upon the window looking out, without looking at anything, while young Thomas stood sniffing revengefully at the fire.
<p/>Adam Smith and Malthus, two younger Gradgrinds, were out at lecture in custody; and little Jane, after manufacturing a good deal of moist pipe-clay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face with slate-pencil and tears, had fallen asleep over vulgar fractions. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I didn't climb up the ladder in them. - Shouldn't be so high up, if I had.'  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>It's all right now, Louisa: it's all right, young Thomas,' said Mr. Bounderby; <div class="bookquote">`you won't do so any more.
<p/>You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Louisa, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had coldly paused, and slowly walked across the room, and ungraciously raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) cheek towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face turned away. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'll answer for it's being all over with father. Well, Louisa, that's worth a kiss, isn't it?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Always my pet; ain't you, Louisa?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) went his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) way, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had kissed, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) handkerchief, until it was burning red.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Good-bye, Louisa!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was still doing this, five minutes afterwards. <div class="bookquote">` What are you about, Loo?'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brother sulkily remonstrated. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You'll rub a hole in your face.'  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like, Tom. I wouldn't cry!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER V - THE KEYNOTE COKETOWN, to which Messrs. Bounderby and Gradgrind now walked, was a triumph of fact; it had no greater taint of fancy in it than Mrs. Gradgrind herself.
<p/>It was a town of red brick, or of brick that would have been red if the smoke and ashes had allowed it; but as matters stood, it was a town of unnatural red and black like the painted face of a savage.
<p/>It was a town of machinery and tall chimneys, out of which interminable serpents of smoke trailed themselves for ever and ever, and never got uncoiled.
<p/>It had a black canal in it, and a river that ran purple with ill-smelling dye, and vast piles of building full of windows where there was a rattling and a trembling all day long, and where the piston of the steam-engine worked monotonously up and down, like the head of an elephant in a state of melancholy madness.
<p/>It contained several large streets all very like one another, and many small streets still more like one another, inhabited by people equally like one another, who all went in and out at the same hours, with the same sound upon the same pavements, to do the same work, and to whom every day was the same as yesterday and to-morrow, and every year the counterpart of the last and the next.
<p/>These attributes of Coketown were in the main inseparable from the work by which it was sustained; against them were to be set off, comforts of life which found their way all over the world, and elegancies of life which made, we will not ask how much of the fine lady, who could scarcely bear to hear the place mentioned.
<p/>Let us strike the key-note, Coketown, before pursuing our tune. The rest of its features were voluntary, and they were these.
<p/>If the members of a religious persuasion built a chapel there - as the members of eighteen religious persuasions had done - they made it a pious warehouse of red brick, with sometimes -LRB-but this is only in highly ornamental examples-RRB- a bell in a birdcage on the top of it.
<p/>The solitary exception was the New Church; a stuccoed edifice with a square steeple over the door, terminating in four short pinnacles like florid wooden legs.
<p/>You saw nothing in Coketown but what was severely workful. All the public inscriptions in the town were painted alike, in severe characters of black and white.
<p/>The jail might have been the infirmary, the infirmary might have been the jail, the town-hall might have been either, or both, or anything else, for anything that appeared to the contrary in the graces of their construction.
<p/>The M'Choakumchild school was all fact, and the school of design was all fact, and the relations between master and man were all fact, and everything was fact between the lying-in hospital and the cemetery, and what you couldn't state in figures, or show to be purchaseable in the cheapest market and saleable in the dearest, was not, and never should be, world without end, Amen.
<p/>Fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the material aspect of the town; fact, fact, fact, everywhere in the immaterial. A town so sacred to fact, and so triumphant in its assertion, of course got on well?
<p/>Why no, not quite well. No? Dear me! No. Coketown did not come out of its own furnaces, in all respects like gold that had stood the fire.
<p/>First, the perplexing mystery of the place was, Who belonged to the eighteen denominations? Because, whoever did, the labouring people did not.
<p/>It was very strange to walk through the streets on a Sunday morning, and note how few of them the barbarous jangling of bells that was driving the sick and nervous mad, called away from their own quarter, from their own close rooms, from the corners of their own streets, where they lounged listlessly, gazing at all the church and chapel going, as at a thing with which they had no manner of concern.
<p/>Nor was it merely the stranger who noticed this, because there was a native organization in Coketown itself, whose members were to be heard of in the House of Commons every session, indignantly petitioning for acts of parliament that should make these people religious by main force.
<p/>Then came the Teetotal Society, who complained that these same people would get drunk, and showed in tabular statements that they did get drunk, and proved at tea parties that no inducement, human or Divine -LRB-except a medal-RRB-, would induce them to forego their custom of getting drunk.
<p/>Then came the experienced chaplain of the jail, with more tabular statements, outdoing all the previous tabular statements, and showing that the same people would resort to low haunts, hidden from the public eye, where they heard low singing and saw low dancing, and mayhap joined in it; and where A. B., aged twenty-four next birthday, and committed for eighteen months' solitary, had himself said -LRB-not that he (<font color='blue'><b>chaplain</b></font>) had ever shown himself particularly worthy of belief-RRB-
<p/>Then came the chemist and druggist, with other tabular statements, showing that when they didn't get drunk, they took opium. his (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) ruin began, as he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) was perfectly sure and confident that otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>chemist</b></font>) would have been a tip-top moral specimen.
<p/>Then came Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby, the two gentlemen at this present moment walking through Coketown, and both eminently practical, who could, on occasion, furnish more tabular statements derived from their own personal experience, and illustrated by cases they had known and seen, from which it clearly appeared - in short, it was the only clear thing in the case - that these same people were a bad lot altogether, gentlemen; that do what you would for them they were never thankful for it, gentlemen; that they were restless, gentlemen; that they never knew what they wanted; that they lived upon the best, and bought fresh butter; and insisted on Mocha coffee, and rejected all but prime parts of meat, and yet were eternally dissatisfied and unmanageable.
<p/>In short, it was the moral of the old nursery fable: There was an old woman, and what do you think?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lived upon nothing but victuals and drink; Victuals and drink were the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) diet, And yet this old woman would NEVER be quiet.
<p/>Is it possible, I wonder, that there was any analogy between the case of the Coketown population and the case of the little Gradgrinds?
<p/>Surely, none of us in our sober senses and acquainted with figures, are to be told at this time of day, that one of the foremost elements in the existence of the Coketown working-people had been for scores of years, deliberately set at nought?
<p/>That exactly in the ratio as they worked long and monotonously, the craving grew within them for some physical relief - some relaxation, encouraging good humour and good spirits, and giving them a vent - some recognized holiday, though it were but for an honest dance to a stirring band of music - some occasional light pie in which even M'Choakumchild had no finger - which craving must and would be satisfied aright, or must and would inevitably go wrong, until the laws of the Creation were repealed? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That there was any Fancy in them demanding to be brought into healthy existence instead of struggling on in convulsions? This man lives at Pod's End, and I don't quite know Pod's End,'  (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Which is it, Bounderby?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bounderby knew it was somewhere down town, but knew no more respecting it. So they stopped for a moment, looking about.
<p/>Almost as they did so, there came running round the corner of the street at a quick pace and with a frightened look, a girl whom Mr. Gradgrind recognized. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Halloa!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Stop! Where are you going! Stop!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Girl number twenty stopped then, palpitating, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) a curtsey. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why are you tearing about the streets,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`in this improper manner?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I was - I was run after, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>the girl panted, <div class="bookquote">`and I wanted to get away.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>The question was unexpectedly and suddenly answered for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), by the colourless boy, Bitzer, who came round the corner with such blind speed and so little anticipating a stoppage on the pavement, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) brought himself up against Mr. Gradgrind's waistcoat and rebounded into the road. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Run after?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` Who would run after you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>What do you mean, boy?' said Mr. Gradgrind. ` What are you doing?
<p/>Bitzer picked up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) cap, which the concussion had knocked off; and backing, and knuckling his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) forehead, pleaded that it was an accident. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How dare you dash against - everybody - in this manner?'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>Was this boy running after you, Jupe?' asked Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said the girl reluctantly. <div class="bookquote">` No, I wasn't, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">` Not till she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) run away from me.
<p/>But the horse-riders never mind what they say, sir; they're famous for it. You know the horse-riders are famous for never minding what they say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>addressing Sissy. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's as well known in the town as - please, sir, as the multiplication table isn't known to the horse-riders.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>Bitzer tried Mr. Bounderby with this. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) frightened me so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said the girl, <div class="bookquote">`with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) cruel faces!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>cried Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">` Oh! An't you one of the rest!
<p/>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would know how to define a horse to-morrow, and offered to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ran away, and I ran after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), sir, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might know how to answer when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was asked.
<p/>An't you a horse-rider! I never looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), sir. You wouldn't have thought of saying such mischief if you hadn't been a horse-rider?'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) calling seems to be pretty well known among 'em,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` You'd have had the whole school peeping in a row, in a week.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Truly, I think so,'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">` Bitzer, turn you about and take yourself home. Jupe, stay here a moment.
<p/>Let me hear of your running in this manner any more, boy, and you will hear of me through the master of the school.
<p/>You understand what I mean. Go along.'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>The boy stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) rapid blinking, knuckled his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) forehead again, glanced at Sissy, turned about, and retreated. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, girl,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`take this gentleman and me to your father's; we are going there. What have you got in that bottle you are carrying?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Gin,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` Dear, no, sir! It's the nine oils.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` The what?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>Then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, with a loud short laugh, <div class="bookquote">`what the devil do you rub your father with nine oils for?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>By George!'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`when I was four or five years younger than you, I had worse bruises upon me than ten oils, twenty oils, forty oils, would have rubbed off.
<p/>I didn't get 'em by posture-making, but by being banged about. There was no rope- dancing for me; I danced on the bare ground and was larruped with the rope.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) said, in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) meant for a reassuring tone, as they turned down a narrow road, <div class="bookquote">`And this is Pod's End; is it, Jupe?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Gradgrind, though hard enough, was by no means so rough a man as Mr. Bounderby. This is it, sir, and - if you wouldn't mind, sir - this is the house.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As haggard and as shabby, as if, for want of custom, it had itself taken to drinking, and had gone the way all drunkards go, and was very near the end of it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's only crossing the bar, sir, and up the stairs, if you wouldn't mind, and waiting there for a moment till I get a candle.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stopped, at twilight, at the door of a mean little public- house, with dim red lights in it. If you should hear a dog, sir, it's only Merrylegs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) only barks.'  (<font color='red'><b>all drunkards</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Merrylegs and nine oils, eh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, entering last with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) metallic laugh. <div class="bookquote">` Pretty well this, for a self-made man!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>The Pegasus's legs might have been more to the purpose; but, underneath the winged horse upon the sign-board, the Pegasus's Arms was inscribed in Roman letters.
<p/>Beneath that inscription again, in a flowing scroll, the painter had touched off the lines: Good malt makes good beer, Walk in, and they'll draw it here; Good wine makes good brandy, Give us a call, and you'll find it handy.
<p/>Framed and glazed upon the wall behind the dingy little bar, was another Pegasus - a theatrical one - with real gauze let in for his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) wings, golden stars stuck on all over him (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) ethereal harness made of red silk.
<p/>As it had grown too dusky without, to see the sign, and as it had not grown light enough within to see the picture, Mr. Gradgrind and Mr. Bounderby received no offence from these idealities.
<p/>They followed the girl up some steep corner-stairs without meeting any one, and stopped in the dark while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) went on for a candle.
<p/>They expected every moment to hear Merrylegs give tongue, but the highly trained performing dog had not barked when the girl and the candle appeared together. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>CHAPTER VI - SLEARY'S HORSEMANSHIP THE name of the public-house was the Pegasus's Arms. Father is not in our room, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl candle</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>SLEARY</b></font>) said, with a face of great surprise. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If you wouldn't mind walking in, I'll find him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) directly.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They walked in; and Sissy, having set two chairs for them, sped away with a quick light step.
<p/>The white night-cap, embellished with two peacock's feathers and a pigtail bolt upright, in which Signor Jupe had that very afternoon enlivened the varied performances with his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) chaste Shaksperean quips and retorts, hung upon a nail; but no other portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) wardrobe, or other token of himself or his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) pursuits, was to be seen anywhere.
<p/>As to Merrylegs, that respectable ancestor of the highly trained animal who went aboard the ark, might have been accidentally shut out of it, for any sign of a dog that was manifest to eye or ear in the Pegasus's Arms.
<p/>They heard the doors of rooms above, opening and shutting as Sissy went from one to another in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) father; and presently they heard voices expressing surprise.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) came bounding down again in a great hurry, opened a battered and mangy old hair trunk, found it empty, and looked round with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) hands clasped and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) face full of terror. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was a mean, shabbily furnished room, with a bed in it. Father must have gone down to the Booth, sir.
<p/>I don't know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) should go there, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) must be there; I'll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) in a minute!'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) was gone directly, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) bonnet; with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) long, dark, childish hair streaming behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>). `
<p/>Before Mr. Bounderby could reply, a young man appeared at the door, and introducing himself with the words, <div class="bookquote">`By your leaves, gentlemen!'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>walked in with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) pockets.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) face, close-shaven, thin, and sallow, was shaded by a great quantity of dark hair, brushed into a roll all round his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) head, and parted up the centre.
<p/>What does she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) mean!' said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` Back in a minute? It's more than a mile off.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) legs were very robust, but shorter than legs of good proportions should have been.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was dressed in a Newmarket coat and tight-fitting trousers; wore a shawl round his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) neck; smelt of lamp-oil, straw, orange-peel, horses' provender, and sawdust; and looked a most remarkable sort of Centaur, compounded of the stable and the play-house.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) chest and back were as much too broad, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) legs were too short. Where the one began, and the other ended, nobody could have told with any precision.
<p/>This gentleman was mentioned in the bills of the day as Mr. E. W. B. Childers, so justly celebrated for his (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) daring vaulting act as the Wild Huntsman of the North American Prairies; in which popular performance, a diminutive boy with an old face, who now accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), assisted as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) infant son: being carried upside down over his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's shoulder, by one foot, and held by the crown of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) head, heels upwards, in the palm of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father's hand, according to the violent paternal manner in which wild huntsmen may be observed to fondle their offspring.
<p/>Made up with curls, wreaths, wings, white bismuth, and carmine, this hopeful young person soared into so pleasing a Cupid as to constitute the chief delight of the maternal part of the spectators; but in private, where his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) characteristics were a precocious cutaway coat and an extremely gruff voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) became of the Turf, turfy. <div class="bookquote">`

Childers took one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) hands out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) pockets, stroked his (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) face and chin, and looked, with a good deal of doubt and a little hope, at Mr. Gradgrind.
<p/>From the first he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had sought to conciliate that gentleman, for the sake of the deserted girl. <div class="bookquote">` When Sissy got into the school here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">`her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) father was as pleased as Punch.
<p/>I suppose, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had this move in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) mind - he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was always half-cracked - and then considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) provided for.
<p/>If you should happen to have looked in to-night, for the purpose of telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) that you were going to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) any little service,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Childers, stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) face again, and repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) look, <div class="bookquote">`it would be very fortunate and well-timed; very fortunate and well- timed.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Childers/Mr. E. W. B. Childers/Childers</b></font>)</div><p/>I couldn't altogether make out why, myself, as we were not stationary here, being but comers and goers anywhere. <div class="bookquote">`On the contrary,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I came to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) connections made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) not an object for the school, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) must not attend any more.
<p/>Still, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) father really has left her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>), without any connivance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) part - Bounderby, let me have a word with you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon this, Mr. Childers politely betook himself, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) equestrian walk, to the landing outside the door, and there stood stroking his (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) face, and softly whistling.
<p/>While thus engaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) overheard such phrases in Mr. Bounderby's voice as <div class="bookquote">`No. I say no. I advise you not. I say by no means.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>But even as an example to Louisa, of what this pursuit which has been the subject of a vulgar curiosity, leads to and ends in.
<p/>While, from Mr. Gradgrind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) heard in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) much lower tone the words, <div class="bookquote">` Think of it, Bounderby, in that point of view.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Meanwhile, the various members of Sleary's company gradually gathered together from the upper regions, where they were quartered, and, from standing about, talking in low voices to one another and to Mr. Childers, gradually insinuated themselves and him (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) into the room.
<p/>There were two or three handsome young women among them, with their two or three husbands, and their two or three mothers, and their eight or nine little children, who did the fairy business when required.
<p/>The father of one of the families was in the habit of balancing the father of another of the families on the top of a great pole; the father of a third family often made a pyramid of both those fathers, with Master Kidderminster for the apex, and himself for the base; all the fathers could dance upon rolling casks, stand upon bottles, catch knives and balls, twirl hand-basins, ride upon anything, jump over everything, and stick at nothing.
<p/>All the mothers could -LRB-and did-RRB- dance, upon the slack wire and the tight-rope, and perform rapid acts on bare-backed steeds; none of them were at all particular in respect of showing their legs; and one of them, alone in a Greek chariot, drove six in hand into every town they came to.
<p/>They all assumed to be mighty rakish and knowing, they were not very tidy in their private dresses, they were not at all orderly in their domestic arrangements, and the combined literature of the whole company would have produced but a poor letter on any subject.
<p/>Yet there was a remarkable gentleness and childishness about these people, a special inaptitude for any kind of sharp practice, and an untiring readiness to help and pity one another, deserving often of as much respect, and always of as much generous construction, as the every- day virtues of any class of people in the world.
<p/>Last of all appeared Mr. Sleary: a stout man as already mentioned, with one fixed eye, and one loose eye, a voice -LRB-if it can be called so-RRB- like the efforts of a broken old pair of bellows, a flabby surface, and a muddled head which was never sober and never drunk. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thquire!'  (<font color='red'><b>a stout man</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sleary, who was troubled with asthma, and whose breath came far too thick and heavy for the letter s, <div class="bookquote">`Your thervant!
<p/>Thith ith a bad piethe of bithnith, thith ith. You've heard of my Clown and hith dog being thuppothed to have morrithed?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, Thquire,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) returned, taking off his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) hat, and rubbing the lining with his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) pocket-handkerchief, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) kept inside for the purpose. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) addressed Mr. Gradgrind, who answered <div class="bookquote">`Yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ith it your intenthion to do anything for the poor girl, Thquire?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I shall have something to propose to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes back,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Glad to hear it, Thquire. Not that I want to get rid of the child, any more than I want to thtand in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) way.

(<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I dare say not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What thall it be, Thquire, while you wait? Thall it be Therry? Give it a name, Thquire!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sleary, with hospitable ease. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nothing for me, I thank you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` Don't thay nothing, Thquire. What doth your friend thay? If you haven't took your feed yet, have a glath of bitterth.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Here his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) daughter Josephine - a pretty fair-haired girl of eighteen, who had been tied on a horse at two years old, and had made a will at twelve, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) always carried about with her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>), expressive of her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) dying desire to be drawn to the grave by the two piebald ponies - cried, `Father, hush!
<p/>And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) saw them all assembled, and saw their looks, and saw no father there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) broke into a most deplorable cry, and took refuge on the bosom of the most accomplished tight-rope lady -LRB-herself in the family-way-RRB-, who knelt down on the floor to nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), and to weep over her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) has come back!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Then came Sissy Jupe, running into the room as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jupe</b></font>) had run out of it. Ith an internal thame, upon my thoul it ith,' said Sleary.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` O my dear father, my good kind father, where are you gone? You are gone to try to do me some good, I know!
<p/>You are gone away for my sake, I am sure! And how miserable and helpless you will be without me, poor, poor father, until you come back!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sleary/Josephine/Miss Josephine Sleary</b></font>)</div><p/>It was so pathetic to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) saying many things of this kind, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) face turned upward, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) arms stretched out as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) were trying to stop his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) departing shadow and embrace it, that no one spoke a word until Mr. Bounderby -LRB-growing impatient-RRB- took the case in hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, good people all,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`this is wanton waste of time. Let the girl understand the fact. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) take it from me, if you like, who have been run away from, myself.
<p/>Here, what's your name! Your father has absconded - deserted you - and you mustn't expect to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again as long as you live.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They cared so little for plain Fact, these people, and were in that advanced state of degeneracy on the subject, that instead of being impressed by the speaker's strong common sense, they took it in extraordinary dudgeon.
<p/>The men muttered <div class="bookquote">`Shame!'  (<font color='red'><b>The men</b></font>)</div>and the women <div class="bookquote">`Brute!'  (<font color='red'><b>the women</b></font>)</div>and Sleary, in some haste, communicated the following hint, apart to Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I tell you what, Thquire. To thpeak plain to you, my opinion ith that you had better cut it thort, and drop it.
<p/>They're a very good natur'd people, my people, but they're accuthtomed to be quick in their movementh; and if you don't act upon my advithe, I'm damned if I don't believe they'll pith you out o'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>winder.'
<p/>Mr. Bounderby being restrained by this mild suggestion, Mr. Gradgrind found an opening for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) eminently practical exposition of the subject. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is of no moment,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`whether this person is to be expected back at any time, or the contrary.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) is gone away, and there is no present expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) return. That, I believe, is agreed on all hands.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I, who came here to inform the father of the poor girl, Jupe, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jupe</b></font>) could not be received at the school any more, in consequence of there being practical objections, into which I need not enter, to the reception there of the children of persons so employed, am prepared in these altered circumstances to make a proposal.
<p/>Thath agreed, Thquire. Thick to that!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>From Sleary. ` Well then. I am willing to take charge of you, Jupe, and to educate you, and provide for you.
<p/>The only condition -LRB-over and above your good behaviour-RRB- I make is, that you decide now, at once, whether to accompany me or remain here.
<p/>Also, that if you accompany me now, it is understood that you communicate no more with any of your friends who are here present.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`At the thame time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sleary/Josephine/Miss Josephine Sleary</b></font>)</div>said Sleary, <div class="bookquote">`I mutht put in my word, Thquire, tho that both thides of the banner may be equally theen.
<p/>These observations comprise the whole of the case.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sleary/Josephine/Miss Josephine Sleary</b></font>)</div>If you like, Thethilia, to be prentitht, you know the natur of the work
<p/>Emma Gordon, in whothe lap you're a lying at prethent, would be a mother to you, and Joth`phine would be a thithter to you.

<p/>your tip, you'd find me cut up rough, and thwear an oath or two at you. I never wath much of a Cackler, Thquire, and I have thed my thay.'
<p/>The latter part of this speech was addressed to Mr. Gradgrind, who received it with a grave inclination of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) head, and then remarked: <div class="bookquote">`The only observation I will make to you, Jupe, in the way of influencing your decision, is, that it is highly desirable to have a sound practical education, and that even your father himself -LRB-from what I understand-RRB- appears, on your behalf, to have known and felt that much.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jupe</b></font>) stopped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jupe</b></font>) wild crying, a little detached herself from Emma Gordon, and turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) face full upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) patron.
<p/>The whole company perceived the force of the change, and drew a long breath together, that plainly said, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>) will go!'
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>The last words had a visible effect upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gordon</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`Be sure you know your own mind, Jupe,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gradgrind cautioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jupe</b></font>); `I say no more.

 (<font color='red'><b>the girl</b></font>)</div><p/>You may be quite at ease,' said Mr. Gradgrind, calmly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) worked out the whole matter like a sum: <div class="bookquote">`you may be quite at ease, Jupe, on that score.
<p/>Be sure you know your own mind!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>` In such a case, your father, I apprehend, must find out Mr. - ` <div class="bookquote">`Thleary.

<p/>I should have no power of keeping you against his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) wish, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) would have no difficulty, at any time, in finding Mr. Thomas Gradgrind of Coketown.
<p/>I am well known.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well known,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div>assented Mr. Sleary, rolling his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) loose eye. ` You're one of the thort, Thquire, that keepth a prethiouth thight of money out of the houthe.
<p/>There was another silence; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) exclaimed, sobbing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) hands before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) face, <div class="bookquote">`Oh, give me my clothes, give me my clothes, and let me go away before I break my heart!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The women sadly bestirred themselves to get the clothes together - it was soon done, for they were not many - and to pack them in a basket which had often travelled with them.
<p/>But never mind that at prethent.' Sissy sat all the time upon the ground, still sobbing, and covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) eyes. Mr. Gradgrind and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) friend Bounderby stood near the door, ready to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) away.
<p/>Mr. Sleary stood in the middle of the room, with the male members of the company about him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>), exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) would have stood in the centre of the ring during his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) daughter Josephine's performance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) wanted nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) whip. The basket packed in silence, they brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) bonnet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>), and smoothed her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) disordered hair, and put it on.
<p/>Then they pressed about her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>), and bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) in very natural attitudes, kissing and embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>): and brought the children to take leave of her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>); and were a tender-hearted, simple, foolish set of women altogether. `
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) had to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) farewell of the male part of the company yet, and every one of them had to unfold his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) arms -LRB-for they all assumed the professional attitude when they found themselves near Sleary-RRB-, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) a parting kiss - Master Kidderminster excepted, in whose young nature there was an original flavour of the misanthrope, who was also known to have harboured matrimonial views, and who moodily withdrew.
<p/>Opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) arms wide he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) by both her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) hands, and would have sprung her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) up and down, after the riding-master manner of congratulating young ladies on their dismounting from a rapid act; but there was no rebound in Sissy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) only stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) crying. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, Jupe,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` If you are quite determined, come!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Mr. Sleary was reserved until the last. Good-bye, my dear!' said Sleary. <div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>Sleary/Josephine/Miss Josephine Sleary</b></font>)</div><p/>With that he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) attentively with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) fixed eye, surveyed his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) company with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) loose one, kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>), shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) head, and handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) to Mr. Gradgrind as to a horse. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There the ith, Thquire,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) said, sweeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) with a professional glance as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) were being adjusted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) seat, <div class="bookquote">`and the'll do you juthtithe.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>In a variety of voices from all the room.
<p/>But the riding-master eye had observed the bottle of the nine oils in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) bosom, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) now interposed with <div class="bookquote">`Leave the bottle, my dear; ith large to carry; it will be of no uthe to you now.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The Sleary philosophy was propounded as they went downstairs and the fixed eye of Philosophy - and its rolling eye, too - soon lost the three figures and the basket in the darkness of the street.
<p/>Farewell, Thethilia! Make the betht of uth; not the wurtht. CHAPTER VII - MRS. SPARSIT MR. BOUNDERBY being a bachelor , an elderly lady presided over his (<font color='blue'><b>BOUNDERBY</b></font>) establishment, in consideration of a certain annual stipend.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit was this lady's name; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was a prominent figure in attendance on Mr. Bounderby's car, as it rolled along in triumph with the Bully of humility inside.
<p/>For, Mrs. Sparsit had not only seen different days, but was highly connected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had a great aunt living in these very times called Lady Scadgers.
<p/>Mr. Sparsit, deceased, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) was the relict, had been by the mother's side what Mrs. Sparsit still called <div class="bookquote">`a Powler.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Strangers of limited information and dull apprehension were sometimes observed not to know what a Powler was, and even to appear uncertain whether it might be a business, or a political party, or a profession of faith.
<p/>The better class of minds, however, did not need to be informed that the Powlers were an ancient stock, who could trace themselves so exceedingly far back that it was not surprising if they sometimes lost themselves - which they had rather frequently done, as respected horse-flesh, blind-hookey, Hebrew monetary transactions, and the Insolvent Debtors' Court.
<p/>The late Mr. Sparsit, being by the mother's side a Powler, married this lady, being by the father's side a Scadgers.
<p/>Lady Scadgers -LRB-an immensely fat old woman, with an inordinate appetite for butcher's meat, and a mysterious leg which had now refused to get out of bed for fourteen years-RRB- contrived the marriage, at a period when Sparsit was just of age, and chiefly noticeable for a slender body, weakly supported on two long slim props, and surmounted by no head worth mentioning.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) inherited a fair fortune from his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) uncle, but owed it all before he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) came into it, and spent it twice over immediately afterwards.
<p/>Thus, when he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) died, at twenty-four -LRB-the scene of his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) decease, Calais, and the cause, brandy-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) did not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) widow, from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) had been separated soon after the honeymoon, in affluent circumstances.
<p/>That bereaved lady, fifteen years older than he (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>), fell presently at deadly feud with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) only relative, Lady Scadgers; and, partly to spite her (<font color='blue'><b>Scadgers</b></font>) ladyship, and partly to maintain herself, went out at a salary.
<p/>And here she (<font color='blue'><b>Scadgers</b></font>) was now, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Scadgers</b></font>) elderly days, with the Coriolanian style of nose and the dense black eyebrows which had captivated Sparsit, making Mr. Bounderby's tea as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) breakfast.
<p/>If Bounderby had been a Conqueror, and Mrs. Sparsit a captive Princess whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) took about as a feature in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) state-processions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) could not have made a greater flourish with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) habitually did.
<p/>Just as it belonged to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) boastfulness to depreciate his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) own extraction, so it belonged to it to exalt Mrs. Sparsit's.
<p/>In the measure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would not allow his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) own youth to have been attended by a single favourable circumstance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) brightened Mrs. Sparsit's juvenile career with every possible advantage, and showered waggon-loads of early roses all over that lady's path. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And yet, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>that lady</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would say, <div class="bookquote">`how does it turn out after all? Why here she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is at a hundred a year
<p/>Nay, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) made this foil of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) so very widely known, that third parties took it up, and handled it on some occasions with considerable briskness.
<p/>It was one of the most exasperating attributes of Bounderby, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) not only sang his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) own praises but stimulated other men to sing them.
<p/>-LRB-I give her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a hundred, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is pleased to term handsome-RRB-, keeping the house of Josiah Bounderby of Coketown!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>There was a moral infection of clap-trap in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>).
<p/>They made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) out to be the Royal arms, the Union-Jack, Magna Charta, John Bull, Habeas Corpus, the Bill of Rights, An Englishman's house is his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) castle, Church and State, and God save the Queen, all put together.
<p/>And as often -LRB-and it was very often-RRB- as an orator of this kind brought into his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) peroration, <div class="bookquote">`Princes and lords may flourish or may fade, A breath can make them, as a breath has made,'
 (<font color='red'><b>an orator</b></font>)</div><p/>Strangers, modest enough elsewhere, started up at dinners in Coketown, and boasted, in quite a rampant way, of Bounderby. - it was, for certain, more or less understood among the company that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had heard of Mrs. Sparsit. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">`I am thinking about Tom Gradgrind's whim;'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Tom Gradgrind, for a bluff independent manner of speaking - as if somebody were always endeavouring to bribe him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) with immense sums to say Thomas, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wouldn't; <div class="bookquote">`Tom Gradgrind's whim, ma'am, of bringing up the tumbling-girl.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The girl is now waiting to know,' said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) is to go straight to the school, or up to the Lodge.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bounderby,' said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`you are unusually slow, sir, with your breakfast this morning.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) must wait, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>answered Bounderby, 'till I know myself.

<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) I would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) a shake-down here, last night, in order that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) might sleep on it before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) decided to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) have any association with Louisa.' `
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit's Coriolanian nose underwent a slight expansion of the nostrils, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) black eyebrows contracted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) took a sip of tea. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) can if you wish it, Mr. Bounderby.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Indeed, Mr. Bounderby? Very thoughtful of you!'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It's tolerably clear to me,' said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`that the little puss can get small good out of such companionship.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Your observation being limited to ``little puss,''' said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`and there being two little girls in question, I did not know which might be indicated by that expression.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Are you speaking of young Miss Gradgrind, Mr. Bounderby?'

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` Louisa,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Bounderby. `
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit took a little more tea; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) again contracted eyebrows over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) steaming cup, rather looked as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) classical countenance were invoking the infernal gods. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If you had said I was another father to Tom - young Tom, I mean, not my friend Tom Gradgrind - you might have been nearer the mark.

<p/>Mrs. Spirit's <div class="bookquote">`sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>in addressing Mr. Bounderby, was a word of ceremony, rather exacting consideration for herself in the use, than honouring him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Going to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) under my wing, ma'am.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Indeed?

(<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'm not going to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) at once; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) is to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) educational cramming before then,' said Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>)'d open his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) eyes, that boy would, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) knew how empty of learning my young maw was, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) time of life.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>By the Lord Harry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>)'ll have enough of it, first and last!

<p/>But it's extraordinary the difficulty I have on scores of such subjects, in speaking to any one on equal terms. Here, for example, I have been speaking to you this morning about tumblers.
<p/>At the time when, to have been a tumbler in the mud of the streets, would have been a godsend to me, a prize in the lottery to me, you were at the Italian Opera.
<p/>You were coming out of the Italian Opera, ma'am, in white satin and jewels, a blaze of splendour, when I hadn't a penny to buy a link to light you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I certainly, sir,' returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a dignity serenely mournful, <div class="bookquote">`was familiar with the Italian Opera at a very early age.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Why, what do you know about tumblers? ` <div class="bookquote">` Egad, ma'am, so was I,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>People like you, ma'am, accustomed from infancy to lie on Down feathers, have no idea how hard a paving-stone is, without trying it.
<p/>A hard bed the pavement of its Arcade used to make, I assure you. No, no, it's of no use my talking to you about tumblers.
<p/>I should speak of foreign dancers, and the West End of London, and May Fair, and lords and ladies and honourables.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I trust, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, with decent resignation, <div class="bookquote">`it is not necessary that you should do anything of that kind.
<p/>If I have acquired an interest in hearing of your instructive experiences, and can scarcely hear enough of them, I claim no merit for that, since I believe it is a general sentiment.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>patron Bounderby</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) patron, <div class="bookquote">`perhaps some people may be pleased to say that they do like to hear, in his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) own unpolished way, what Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown, has gone through.
<p/>I hope I have learnt how to accommodate myself to the changes of life. But you must confess that you were born in the lap of luxury, yourself.
<p/>Come, ma'am, you know you were born in the lap of luxury.'  (<font color='red'><b>patron Bounderby</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I do not, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit with a shake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">`deny it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bounderby was obliged to get up from table, and stand with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) back to the fire, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was such an enhancement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) position. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is true, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, with an affectation of humility the very opposite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), and therefore in no danger of jostling it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And you were in crack society. Devilish high society,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) said, warming his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) legs. <div class="bookquote">` You were in the tiptop fashion, and all the rest of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

(<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bounderby, bending himself at the knees, literally embraced his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) legs in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) great satisfaction and laughed aloud.
<p/>Mr. and Miss Gradgrind being then announced, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) received the former with a shake of the hand, and the latter with a kiss. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>On coming in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) curtseyed to Mr. Bounderby, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) friend Tom Gradgrind, and also to Louisa; but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) confusion unluckily omitted Mrs. Sparsit.
<p/>Can Jupe be sent here, Bounderby?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Gradgrind. Certainly. So Jupe was sent there. Observing this, the blustrous Bounderby had the following remarks to make: <div class="bookquote">`Now, I tell you what, my girl.
<p/>The name of that lady by the teapot, is Mrs. Sparsit. That lady acts as mistress of this house, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) is a highly connected lady.
<p/>Consequently, if ever you come again into any room in this house, you will make a short stay in it if you don't behave towards that lady in your most respectful manner.
<p/>So far from having high connections I have no connections at all, and I come of the scum of the earth.
<p/>But towards that lady, I do care what you do; and you shall do what is deferential and respectful, or you shall not come here.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, I don't care a button what you do to me, because I don't affect to be anybody. <div class="bookquote">` I hope, Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>anybody</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, in a conciliatory voice, <div class="bookquote">`that this was merely an oversight.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`My friend Tom Gradgrind suggests, Mrs. Sparsit,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` You are very good indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) State humility. <div class="bookquote">` It is not worth speaking of.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Sissy, who all this time had been faintly excusing herself with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) eyes, was now waved over by the master of the house to Mr. Gradgrind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) stood looking intently at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), and Louisa stood coldly by, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes upon the ground, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) proceeded thus: <div class="bookquote">`Jupe, I have made up my mind to take you into my house; and, when you are not in attendance at the school, to employ you about Mrs. Gradgrind, who is rather an invalid.
<p/>I have explained to Miss Louisa - this is Miss Louisa - the miserable but natural end of your late career; and you are to expressly understand that the whole of that subject is past, and is not to be referred to any more.
<p/>From this time you begin your history. You are, at present, ignorant, I know.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir, very,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) answered, curtseying. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I shall have the satisfaction of causing you to be strictly educated; and you will be a living proof to all who come into communication with you, of the advantages of the training you will receive.
<p/>You will be reclaimed and formed. You have been in the habit now of reading to your father, and those people I found you among
<p/>, I dare say?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, beckoning her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) nearer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) said so, and dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Only to father and Merrylegs, sir. At least I mean to father, when Merrylegs was always there.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Never mind Merrylegs, Jupe,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, with a passing frown. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't ask about him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>). I understand you to have been in the habit of reading to your father?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` O, yes, sir, thousands of times.
<p/>They were the happiest - O, of all the happy times we had together, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>It was only now when her (<font color='blue'><b>Jupe</b></font>) sorrow broke out, that Louisa looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>About the Fairies, sir, and the Dwarf, and the Hunchback, and the Genies,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sobbed out; `and about - ` <div class="bookquote">`Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`that is enough.
<p/>And what,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Gradgrind, in a still lower voice, <div class="bookquote">`did you read to your father, Jupe?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Never breathe a word of such destructive nonsense any more.
<p/>Bounderby, this is a case for rigid training, and I shall observe it with interest.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have given you my opinion already, and I shouldn't do as you do. But, very well, very well. Since you are bent upon it, very well!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>So, Mr. Gradgrind and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) daughter took Cecilia Jupe off with them to Stone Lodge, and on the way Louisa never spoke one word, good or bad.
<p/>And Mr. Bounderby went about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) daily pursuits. And Mrs. Sparsit got behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) eyebrows and meditated in the gloom of that retreat, all the evening.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was half a dozen years younger, Louisa had been overheard to begin a conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brother one day, by saying <div class="bookquote">`Tom, I wonder'  (<font color='red'><b>brother day</b></font>)</div>- upon which Mr. Gradgrind, who was the person overhearing, stepped forth into the light and said, <div class="bookquote">`Louisa, never wonder!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the person</b></font>)</div><p/>Herein lay the spring of the mechanical art and mystery of educating the reason without stooping to the cultivation of the sentiments and affections.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII - NEVER WONDER LET us strike the key-note again, before pursuing the tune. Never wonder. By means of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, settle everything somehow, and never wonder.
<p/>Now, besides very many babies just able to walk, there happened to be in Coketown a considerable population of babies who had been walking against time towards the infinite world, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years and more.
<p/>These portentous infants being alarming creatures to stalk about in any human society, the eighteen denominations incessantly scratched one another's faces and pulled one another's hair by way of agreeing on the steps to be taken for their improvement - which they never did; a surprising circumstance, when the happy adaptation of the means to the end is considered.
<p/>Still, although they differed in every other particular, conceivable and inconceivable -LRB-especially inconceivable-RRB-, they were pretty well united on the point that these unlucky infants were never to wonder.
<p/>Bring to me, says M'Choakumchild, yonder baby just able to walk, and I will engage that it shall never wonder. Body number one, said they must take everything on trust.
<p/>Body number three, wrote leaden little books for them, showing how the good grown-up baby invariably got to the Savings-bank, and the bad grown-up baby invariably got transported.
<p/>Body number four, under dreary pretences of being droll -LRB-when it was very melancholy indeed-RRB-, made the shallowest pretences of concealing pitfalls of knowledge, into which it was the duty of these babies to be smuggled and inveigled.
<p/>Body number two, said they must take everything on political economy. But, all the bodies agreed that they were never to wonder.
<p/>Mr. Gradgrind greatly tormented his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) mind about what the people read in this library: a point whereon little rivers of tabular statements periodically flowed into the howling ocean of tabular statements, which no diver ever got to any depth in and came up sane.
<p/>There was a library in Coketown, to which general access was easy. It was a disheartening circumstance, but a melancholy fact, that even these readers persisted in wondering.
<p/>They wondered about human nature, human passions, human hopes and fears, the struggles, triumphs and defeats, the cares and joys and sorrows, the lives and deaths of common men and women!
<p/>They sometimes, after fifteen hours' work, sat down to read mere fables about men and women, more or less like themselves, and about children, more or less like their own.
<p/>They took De Foe to their bosoms, instead of Euclid, and seemed to be on the whole more comforted by Goldsmith than by Cocker.
<p/>Mr. Gradgrind was for ever working, in print and out of print, at this eccentric sum, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) never could make out how it yielded this unaccountable product. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I, hate it altogether, and I hate everybody except you,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the unnatural young Thomas Gradgrind in the hair-cutting chamber at twilight. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am sick of my life, Loo. You don't hate Sissy, Tom?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I hate to be obliged to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) Jupe.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) hates me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom, moodily. <div class="bookquote">` No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) does not, Tom, I am sure!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) must,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom. `
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) must just hate and detest the whole set-out of us. They'll bother her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) head off, I think, before they have done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>).
<p/>Young Thomas expressed these sentiments sitting astride of a chair before the fire, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) arms on the back, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sulky face on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) arms.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sister sat in the darker corner by the fireside, now looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), now looking at the bright sparks as they dropped upon the hearth. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>As to me,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Tom, tumbling his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hair all manner of ways with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sulky hands, <div class="bookquote">`I am a Donkey, that's what I am.
<p/>I am as obstinate as one, I am more stupid than one, I get as much pleasure as one, and I should like to kick like one.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Already she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s getting as pale as wax, and as heavy as - I am.' <div class="bookquote">`Not me, I hope, Tom?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, Loo
<p/>I don't know what this - jolly old - Jaundiced Jail,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Tom had paused to find a sufficiently complimentary and expressive name for the parental roof, and seemed to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind for a moment by the strong alliteration of this one, <div class="bookquote">`would be without you.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>; I wouldn't hurt you. I made an exception of you at first. Indeed, Tom? Do you really and truly say so?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom, chafing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) coat-sleeve, as if to mortify his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) flesh, and have it in unison with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) spirit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Because, Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister, after silently watching the sparks awhile, `as I get older, and nearer growing up, I often sit wondering here, and think how unfortunate it is for me that I can't reconcile you to home better than I am able to do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, of course I do. What's the use of talking about it!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>returned I don't know what other girls know. I can't play to you, or sing to you.
<p/>I can't talk to you so as to lighten your mind, for I never see any amusing sights or read any amusing books that it would be a pleasure or a relief to you to talk about, when you are tired.' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, no more do I. I am as bad as you in that respect; and I am a Mule too, which you're not.
<p/>If father was determined to make me either a Prig or a Mule, and I am not a Prig, why, it stands to reason, I must be a Mule.
<p/>It's a great pity,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, after another pause, and speaking thoughtfully out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) dark corner: <div class="bookquote">`it's a great pity, Tom.
<p/>And so I am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Tom, desperately. <div class="bookquote">` It's very unfortunate for both of us.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh! You,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom; <div class="bookquote">`you are a girl, Loo, and a girl comes out of it better than a boy does.
<p/>You are the only pleasure I have - you can brighten even this place - and you can always lead me as you like.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>You are a dear brother, Tom; and while you think I can do such things, I don't so much mind knowing better.
<p/>I don't miss anything in you. <div class="bookquote">` Though I do know better, Tom, and am very sorry for it.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) came and kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and went back into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) corner again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I wish I could collect all the Facts we hear so much about,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Tom, spitefully setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) teeth, <div class="bookquote">`and all the Figures, and all the people who found them out: and
<p/>I wish I could put a thousand barrels of gunpowder under them, and blow them all up together! However, when I go to live with old Bounderby, I'll have my revenge.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your revenge, Tom?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I mean, I'll enjoy myself a little, and go about and see something, and hear something.

<p/>But don't disappoint yourself beforehand, Tom. Mr. Bounderby thinks as father thinks, and is a great deal rougher, and not half so kind.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom, laughing; <div class="bookquote">`I don't mind that. I shall very well know how to manage and smooth old Bounderby!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Their shadows were defined upon the wall, but those of the high presses in the room were all blended together on the wall and on the ceiling, as if the brother and sister were overhung by a dark cavern.
<p/>Or, a fanciful imagination - if such treason could have been there - might have made it out to be the shadow of their subject, and of its lowering association with their future. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What is your great mode of smoothing and managing, Tom? Is it a secret?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom, `if it is a secret, it's not far off.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says to me what I don't like, I shall say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), ``My sister Loo will be hurt and disappointed, Mr. Bounderby.
<p/>It's you. You are his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) little pet, you are his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) favourite; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>)'ll do anything for you. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) always used to tell me she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was sure you would be easier with me than this.
<p/>After waiting for some answering remark, and getting none, Tom wearily relapsed into the present time, and twined himself yawning round and about the rails of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chair, and rumpled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head more and more, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) suddenly looked up, and asked: <div class="bookquote">`Have you gone to sleep, Loo?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>'' That'll bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) about, or nothing will.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No, Tom.

<p/>Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>enquired his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister, slowly, and in a curious tone, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were reading what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) asked in the fire, and it was not quite plainly written there, <div class="bookquote">`do you look forward with any satisfaction to this change to Mr. Bounderby's?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, there's one thing to be said of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Tom, pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) chair from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and standing up; <div class="bookquote">`it will be getting away from home.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There is one thing to be said of it,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Louisa repeated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) former curious tone; <div class="bookquote">`it will be getting away from home.
<p/>Another of the advantages, I suppose, of being a girl.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>` Not but what I shall be very unwilling, both to leave you, Loo, and to leave you here.
<p/>But I must go, you know, whether I like it or not; and I had better go where I can take with me some advantage of your influence, than where I should lose it altogether.
<p/>The answer was so long in coming, though there was no indecision in it, that Tom went and leaned on the back of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chair, to contemplate the fire which so engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) point of view, and see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could make of it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't you see?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, Tom.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Except that it is a fire,' said Tom, <div class="bookquote">`it looks to me as stupid and blank as everything else looks.
<p/>But since I have been looking at it, I have been wondering about you and me, grown up.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Wondering again!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What do you see in it? Not a circus?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I don't see anything in it, Tom, particularly. I have such unmanageable thoughts,'  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister, <div class="bookquote">`that they will wonder.'
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>Then I beg of you, Louisa,' said Mrs. Gradgrind, who had opened the door without being heard, <div class="bookquote">`to do nothing of that description, for goodness'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>sake, you inconsiderate girl, or I shall never hear the last of it from your father.
<p/>And, Thomas, it is really shameful, with my poor head continually wearing me out, that a boy brought up as you have been, and whose education has cost what yours has, should be found encouraging his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sister to wonder, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) father has expressly said that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is not to do it.'
<p/>Louisa denied Tom's participation in the offence; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) mother stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) with the conclusive answer, <div class="bookquote">`Louisa, don't tell me, in my state of health; for unless you had been encouraged, it is morally and physically impossible that you could have done it.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I was encouraged by nothing, mother, but by looking at the red sparks dropping out of the fire, and whitening and dying.
<p/>It made me think, after all, how short my life would be, and how little I could hope to do in it.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gradgrind, rendered almost energetic. `
<p/>Don't stand there and tell me such stuff, Louisa, to my face, when you know very well that if it was ever to reach your father's ears I should never hear the last of it.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Nonsense! After all the trouble that has been taken with you! After the lectures you have attended, and the experiments you have seen!
<p/>After I have heard you myself, when the whole of my right side has been benumbed, going on with your master about combustion, and calcination, and calorification, and I may say every kind of ation that could drive a poor invalid distracted, to hear you talking in this absurd way about sparks and ashes!
<p/>I wish,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, taking a chair, and discharging her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) strongest point before succumbing under these mere shadows of facts, <div class="bookquote">`yes, I really do wish that I had never had a family, and then you would have known what it was to do without me!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX - SISSY'S PROGRESS SISSY JUPE had not an easy time of it, between Mr. M'Choakumchild and Mrs. Gradgrind, and was not without strong impulses, in the first months of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) probation, to run away.
<p/>It hailed facts all day long so very hard, and life in general was opened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) as such a closely ruled ciphering-book, that assuredly she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) would have run away, but for only one restraint.
<p/>It is lamentable to think of; but this restraint was the result of no arithmetical process, was self-imposed in defiance of all calculation, and went dead against any table of probabilities that any Actuary would have drawn up from the premises.
<p/>The girl believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father had not deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lived in the hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would come back, and in the faith that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be made the happier by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) remaining where she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was.
<p/>The wretched ignorance with which Jupe clung to this consolation, rejecting the superior comfort of knowing, on a sound arithmetical basis, that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father was an unnatural vagabond, filled Mr. Gradgrind with pity.
<p/>M'Choakumchild reported that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had a very dense head for figures; that, once possessed with a general idea of the globe, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) took the smallest conceivable interest in its exact measurements; that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was extremely slow in the acquisition of dates, unless some pitiful incident happened to be connected therewith; that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would burst into tears on being required -LRB-by the mental process-RRB- immediately to name the cost of two hundred and forty-seven muslin caps at fourteen-pence halfpenny; that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was as low down, in the school, as low could be; that after eight weeks of induction into the elements of Political Economy, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had only yesterday been set right by a prattler three feet high, for returning to the question, <div class="bookquote">`What is the first principle of this science?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet, what was to be done? the absurd answer, <div class="bookquote">`To do unto others as I would that they should do unto me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gradgrind observed, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) head, that all this was very bad; that it showed the necessity of infinite grinding at the mill of knowledge, as per system, schedule, blue book, report, and tabular statements
<p/>A to Z; and that Jupe <div class="bookquote">`must be kept to it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>So Jupe was kept to it, and became low-spirited, but no wiser. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It would be a fine thing to be you, Miss Louisa!'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) said, one night, when Louisa had endeavoured to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) perplexities for next day something clearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Do you think so?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I should know so much, Miss Louisa. All that is difficult to me now, would be so easy then.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You might not be the better for it, Sissy.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>Sissy submitted, after a little hesitation, <div class="bookquote">`I should not be the worse, Miss Louisa.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/>There had been so little communication between these two - both because life at Stone Lodge went monotonously round like a piece of machinery which discouraged human interference, and because of the prohibition relative to Sissy's past career - that they were still almost strangers.
<p/>Sissy, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) dark eyes wonderingly directed to Louisa's face, was uncertain whether to say more or to remain silent. `
<p/>To which Miss Louisa answered, <div class="bookquote">`I don't know that.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>You are more useful to my mother, and more pleasant with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) than I can ever be,' Louisa resumed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are pleasanter to yourself, than I am to myself.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But, if you please, Miss Louisa,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>Sissy pleaded, <div class="bookquote">`I am - O so stupid!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/>Louisa, with a brighter laugh than usual, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) would be wiser by-and-by. <div class="bookquote">` You don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Sissy, half crying, <div class="bookquote">`what a stupid girl I am.
<p/>All through school hours I make mistakes. Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild call me up, over and over again, regularly to make mistakes.
<p/>I can't help them. They seem to come natural to me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild never make any mistakes themselves, I suppose, Sissy?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>O no!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) eagerly returned. <div class="bookquote">` They know everything.'

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I am almost ashamed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said Sissy, with reluctance. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But to-day, for instance, Mr. M'Choakumchild was explaining to us about Natural Prosperity.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` National, I think it must have been,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>observed Louisa. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, it was. - But isn't it the same?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) timidly asked. <div class="bookquote">` You had better say, National, as he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) said so,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>returned Louisa, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) dry reserve. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>National Prosperity. And he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) said, Now, this schoolroom is a Nation. And in this nation, there are fifty millions of money.
<p/>Isn't this a prosperous nation? Girl number twenty, isn't this a prosperous nation, and a'n't you in a thriving state?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I thought I couldn't know whether it was a prosperous nation or not, and whether I was in a thriving state or not, unless I knew who had got the money, and whether any of it was mine.
<p/>What did you say?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>asked Louisa. <div class="bookquote">` Miss Louisa, I said I didn't know. But that had nothing to do with it.
<p/>It was not in the figures at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Sissy, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">` That was a great mistake of yours,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>observed Louisa. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, This schoolroom is an immense town, and in it there are a million of inhabitants, and only five-and-twenty are starved to death in the streets, in the course of a year.
<p/>Yes, Miss Louisa, I know it was, now. Then Mr. M'Choakumchild said he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) would try me again. What is your remark on that proportion?
<p/>I couldn't think of a better one - that I thought it must be just as hard upon those who were starved, whether the others were a million, or a million million.
<p/>And my remark was - for And that was wrong, too.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Of course it was.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Then Mr. M'Choakumchild said he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) would try me once more.
<p/>Yes, Miss Louisa - they always remind me of stutterings, and that's another of my mistakes - of accidents upon the sea.
<p/>And I find -LRB-Mr. M'Choakumchild said-RRB- that in a given time a hundred thousand persons went to sea on long voyages, and only five hundred of them were drowned or burnt to death.
<p/>And I said, Miss;'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>here Sissy fairly sobbed as confessing with extreme contrition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) greatest error; <div class="bookquote">`I said it was nothing.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>M'Choakumchild</b></font>) said, Here are the stutterings - ` <div class="bookquote">` Statistics,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Louisa. <div class="bookquote">` What is the percentage? Nothing, Sissy?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nothing, Miss - to the relations and friends of the people who were killed. I shall never learn,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said Sissy. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And the worst of all is, that although my poor father wished me so much to learn, and although I am so anxious to learn, because he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wished me to, I am afraid I don't like it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/>Louisa stood looking at the pretty modest head, as it drooped abashed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), until it was raised again to glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face.
<p/>Sissy hesitated before replying, and so plainly showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) sense that they were entering on forbidden ground, that Louisa added, <div class="bookquote">`No one hears us; and if any one did, I am sure no harm could be found in such an innocent question.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">`Did your father know so much himself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wished you to be well taught too, Sissy?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>No, Miss Louisa,' answered Sissy, upon this encouragement, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) head; <div class="bookquote">`father knows very little indeed.

<p/>Sometimes they played tricks upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); but they never knew how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt them, and shrunk up, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was alone with me.

<p/>To the last?'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>asked Louisa contravening the great principle, and wondering very much. <div class="bookquote">` Always, always!'

<p/>Father, soon after they came home from performing, told Merrylegs to jump up on the backs of the two chairs and stand across them - which is one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) tricks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) looked at father, and didn't do it at once. Everything of father's had gone wrong that night, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hadn't pleased the public at all.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried out that the very dog knew he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was failing, and had no compassion on him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Then he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) beat the dog, and I was frightened, and said, ``Father, father!

<p/><div class="bookquote">`I'll come directly.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I'll wait for you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">`to make sure.'

<p/>and I sat down by him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) all about the school and everything that had been said and done there.
<p/>When I had no more left to tell, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arms round my neck, and kissed me a great many times.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) asked me to fetch some of the stuff he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) used, for the little hurt he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had had, and to get it at the best place, which was at the other end of town from there; and then, after kissing me again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) let me go.
<p/>When I had gone down-stairs, I turned back that I might be a little bit more company to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) yet, and looked in at the door, and said, ``Father dear, shall I take Merrylegs?''
<p/>Father shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) head and said, ``No, Sissy, no; take nothing that's known to be mine, my darling;'' and I left him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) sitting by the fire.
<p/>Then the thought must have come upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), poor, poor father! of going away to try something for my sake; for when I came back, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was gone.'

<p/>Mr. Sleary promised to write as soon as ever father should be heard of, and I trust to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to keep his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) word.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Do look sharp for old Bounderby, Loo!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom, with an impatient whistle. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll be off if you don't look sharp!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>After this, whenever Sissy dropped a curtsey to Mr. Gradgrind in the presence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) family, and said in a faltering way, <div class="bookquote">`I beg your pardon, sir, for being troublesome - but - have you had any letter yet about me?'
 (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div><p/>Louisa would suspend the occupation of the moment, whatever it was, and look for the reply as earnestly as Sissy did.
<p/>And when Mr. Gradgrind regularly answered, <div class="bookquote">`No, Jupe, nothing of the sort,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>the trembling of Sissy's lip would be repeated in Louisa's face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes would follow Sissy with compassion to the door.
<p/>Mr. Gradgrind usually improved these occasions by remarking, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) was gone, that if Jupe had been properly trained from an early age she (<font color='blue'><b>Jupe</b></font>) would have remonstrated to herself on sound principles the baselessness of these fantastic hopes.
<p/>Yet it did seem -LRB-though not to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) saw nothing of it-RRB- as if fantastic hope could take as strong a hold as Fact.
<p/>This observation must be limited exclusively to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) daughter. As to Tom, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was becoming that not unprecedented triumph of calculation which is usually at work on number one.
<p/>As to Mrs. Gradgrind, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) said anything on the subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) would come a little way out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) wrappers, like a feminine dormouse, and say: <div class="bookquote">`Good gracious bless me, how my poor head is vexed and worried by

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>At about this point, Mr. Gradgrind's eye would fall upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>); and under the influence of that wintry piece of fact, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) would become torpid again.
<p/>that girl Jupe's so perseveringly asking, over and over again, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jupe</b></font>) tiresome letters! CHAPTER X - STEPHEN BLACKPOOL I ENTERTAIN a weak idea that the English people are as hard-worked as any people upon whom the sun shines.
<p/>In the hardest working part of Coketown; in the innermost fortifications of that ugly citadel, where Nature was as strongly bricked out as killing airs and gases were bricked in; at the heart of the labyrinth of narrow courts upon courts, and close streets upon streets, which had come into existence piecemeal, every piece in a violent hurry for some one man's purpose, and the whole an unnatural family, shouldering, and trampling, and pressing one another to death; in the last close nook of this great exhausted receiver, where the chimneys, for want of air to make a draught, were built in an immense variety of stunted and crooked shapes, as though every house put out a sign of the kind of people who might be expected to be born in it; among the multitude of Coketown, generically called <div class="bookquote">`the Hands,'  (<font color='red'><b>the multitude</b></font>)</div>- a race who would have found more favour with some people, if Providence had seen fit to make them only hands, or, like the lower creatures of the seashore, only hands and stomachs - lived a certain Stephen Blackpool, forty years of age.
<p/>I acknowledge to this ridiculous idiosyncrasy, as a reason why I would give them a little more play. Stephen looked older, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had had a hard life.
<p/>It is said that every life has its roses and thorns; there seemed, however, to have been a misadventure or mistake in Stephen's case, whereby somebody else had become possessed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) roses, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had become possessed of the same somebody else's thorns in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had known, to use his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) words, a peck of trouble. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was usually called Old Stephen, in a kind of rough homage to the fact.
<p/>A rather stooping man, with a knitted brow, a pondering expression of face, and a hard-looking head sufficiently capacious, on which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) iron-grey hair lay long and thin, Old Stephen might have passed for a particularly intelligent man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) condition.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) took no place among those remarkable <div class="bookquote">`Hands,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>who, piecing together their broken intervals of leisure through many years, had mastered difficult sciences, and acquired a knowledge of most unlikely things.
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) held no station among the Hands who could make speeches and carry on debates. Thousands of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) compeers could talk much better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), at any time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was a good power-loom weaver, and a man of perfect integrity. What more he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, or what else he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), if anything, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) show for himself.
<p/>The lights in the great factories, which looked, when they were illuminated, like Fairy palaces - or the travellers by express- train said so - were all extinguished; and the bells had rung for knocking off for the night, and had ceased again; and the Hands, men and women, boy and girl, were clattering home.
<p/>Old Stephen was standing in the street, with the old sensation upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) which the stoppage of the machinery always produced - the sensation of its having worked and stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own head. `
<p/>It was a wet night, and many groups of young women passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), with their shawls drawn over their bare heads and held close under their chins to keep the rain out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knew Rachael well, for a glance at any one of these groups was sufficient to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was not there.
<p/>At last, there were no more to come; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) turned away, saying in a tone of disappointment, <div class="bookquote">`Why, then, ha'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)!'
<p/>But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had not gone the length of three streets, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) saw another of the shawled figures in advance of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) looked so keenly that perhaps its mere shadow indistinctly reflected on the wet pavement - if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could have seen it without the figure itself moving along from lamp to lamp, brightening and fading as it went - would have been enough to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) who was there.
<p/>Making his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) pace at once much quicker and much softer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) darted on until he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was very near this figure, then fell into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) former walk, and called <div class="bookquote">`Rachael!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) turned, being then in the brightness of a lamp; and raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hood a little, showed a quiet oval face, dark and rather delicate, irradiated by a pair of very gentle eyes, and further set off by the perfect order of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) shining black hair.
<p/>Yet I don't see Rachael, still!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). It was not a face in its first bloom; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was a woman five and thirty years of age. `
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had said this, with a smile which would have been quite expressed, though nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had been seen but her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) pleasant eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) replaced her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hood again, and they went on together. `
<p/>Ah, lad! <div class="bookquote">` Tis thou?'  (<font color='red'><b>Ah lad</b></font>)</div>I thought thou wast ahind me, Rachael?' <div class="bookquote">` No.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Early t`night, lass?'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Times I'm a little early, Stephen! <div class="bookquote">`times a little late.
<p/>I'm never to be counted on, going home.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>` Nor going t`other way, neither, <div class="bookquote">`t seems to me, Rachael?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, Stephen.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) with some disappointment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) face, but with a respectful and patient conviction that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) must be right in whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) did.
<p/>The expression was not lost upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hand lightly on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm a moment as if to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) for it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We are such true friends, lad, and such old friends, and getting to be such old folk, now.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, Rachael, thou`rt as young as ever thou wast.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><p/>One of us would be puzzled how to get old, Stephen, without <div class="bookquote">`t other getting so too, both being alive,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) answered, laughing; <div class="bookquote">`but, anyways, we're such old friends, and t'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>hide a word of honest truth fro' one another would be a sin and a pity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Twould be hard, indeed, if 'twas not to be at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) said, with a cheerfulness she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) sought to communicate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). ''
<p/>Tis hard, anyways, Rachael.' `Try to think not; and <div class="bookquote">`twill seem better.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>`I've tried a long time, and `ta`nt got better.
<p/>` Tis better not to walk too much together. ` Times, yes! ` But thou`rt right; <div class="bookquote">`t might mak fok talk, even of thee.
<p/>Thou hast been that to me, Rachael, through so many year: thou hast done me so much good, and heartened of me in that cheering way, that thy word is a law to me.
<p/>Ah, lass, and a bright good law! Better than some real ones.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Never fret about them, Stephen,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) answered quickly, and not without an anxious glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Let the laws be.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, with a slow nod or two. ` Let 'em be. Let everything be.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Always a muddle?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>said Rachael, with another gentle touch upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm, as if to recall him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) out of the thoughtfulness, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was biting the long ends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) loose neckerchief as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) walked along.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) let them fall, turned a smiling face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), and said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) broke into a good-humoured laugh, `Ay, Rachael, lass, awlus a muddle.
<p/>Let all sorts alone. <div class="bookquote">` Tis a muddle, and that's aw.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The touch had its instantaneous effect. That's where I stick.
<p/>I come to the muddle many times and agen, and I never get beyond it.' They had walked some distance, and were near their own homes.
<p/>It was in one of the many small streets for which the favourite undertaker -LRB-who turned a handsome sum out of the one poor ghastly pomp of the neighbourhood-RRB- kept a black ladder, in order that those who had done their daily groping up and down the narrow stairs might slide out of this working world by the windows.
<p/>The woman's was the first reached. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stopped at the corner, and putting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand in his (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>), wished him (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) good night. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went, with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) neat figure and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sober womanly step, down the dark street, and he (<font color='blue'><b>undertaker</b></font>) stood looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) turned into one of the small houses.
<p/>There was not a flutter of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) coarse shawl, perhaps, but had its interest in this man's eyes; not a tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice but had its echo in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) innermost heart.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was lost to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) view, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) homeward way, glancing up sometimes at the sky, where the clouds were sailing fast and wildly.
<p/>But, they were broken now, and the rain had ceased, and the moon shone, - looking down the high chimneys of Coketown on the deep furnaces below, and casting Titanic shadows of the steam-engines at rest, upon the walls where they were lodged.
<p/>Good night, dear lass; good night!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The man seemed to have brightened with the night, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home, in such another street as the first, saving that it was narrower, was over a little shop.
<p/>How it came to pass that any people found it worth their while to sell or buy the wretched little toys, mixed up in its window with cheap newspapers and pork -LRB-there was a leg to be raffled for to-morrow-night-RRB-, matters not here.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) end of candle from a shelf, lighted it at another end of candle on the counter, without disturbing the mistress of the shop who was asleep in her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) little room, and went upstairs into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lodging.
<p/>It was a room, not unacquainted with the black ladder under various tenants; but as neat, at present, as such a room could be.
<p/>A few books and writings were on an old bureau in a corner, the furniture was decent and sufficient, and, though the atmosphere was tainted, the room was clean.
<p/>Going to the hearth to set the candle down upon a round three- legged table standing there, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stumbled against something.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recoiled, looking down at it, it raised itself up into the form of a woman in a sitting attitude. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A disabled, drunken creature, barely able to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sitting posture by steadying herself with one begrimed hand on the floor, while the other was so purposeless in trying to push away her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tangled hair from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, that it only blinded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) the more with the dirt upon it.
<p/>A creature so foul to look at, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tatters, stains and splashes, but so much fouler than that in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) moral infamy
<p/>Heaven's mercy, woman!'  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, falling farther off from the figure. <div class="bookquote">` Hast thou come back again!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Such a woman! , that it was a shameful thing even to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>After an impatient oath or two, and some stupid clawing of herself with the hand not necessary to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) support, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hair away from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes sufficiently to obtain a sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat swaying her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) body to and fro, and making gestures with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) unnerved arm, which seemed intended as the accompaniment to a fit of laughter, though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face was stolid and drowsy. `
<p/>Some hoarse sounds meant for this, came mockingly out of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at last; and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head dropped forward on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breast. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Eigh, lad? What, yo' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>r there?' Back agen?' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) screeched, after some minutes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) had that moment said it. `
<p/>Roused by the unmeaning violence with which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried it out, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) scrambled up, and stood supporting herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoulders against the wall; dangling in one hand by the string, a dunghill- fragment of a bonnet, and trying to look scornfully at him (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes! And back agen. Back agen ever and ever so often. Back? Yes, back. Why not?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I'll sell thee off again, and I'll sell thee off again, and I'll sell thee off a score of times!'
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cried, with something between a furious menace and an effort at a defiant dance. <div class="bookquote">` Come awa'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>from th' bed!'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) was sitting on the side of it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) face hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) hands. ` Come awa! from <div class="bookquote">`t. 'Tis mine, and I've a right to t' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>!'
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) staggered to it, he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) avoided her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with a shudder, and passed - his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) face still hidden - to the opposite end of the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threw herself upon the bed heavily, and soon was snoring hard. He (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) sunk into a chair, and moved but once all that night.
<p/>It was to throw a covering over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); as if his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) hands were not enough to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), even in the darkness.
<p/>CHAPTER XI - NO WAY OUT THE Fairy palaces burst into illumination, before pale morning showed the monstrous serpents of smoke trailing themselves over Coketown.
<p/>A clattering of clogs upon the pavement; a rapid ringing of bells; and all the melancholy mad elephants, polished and oiled up for the day's monotony, were at their heavy exercise again.
<p/>A special contrast, as every man was in the forest of looms where Stephen worked, to the crashing, smashing, tearing piece of mechanism at which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) laboured.
<p/>Stephen bent over his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) loom, quiet, watchful, and steady. Never fear, good people of an anxious turn of mind, that Art will consign Nature to oblivion.
<p/>Set anywhere, side by side, the work of GOD and the work of man; and the former, even though it be a troop of Hands of very small account, will gain in dignity from the comparison.
<p/>It is known, to the force of a single pound weight, what the engine will do; but, not all the calculators of the National Debt can tell me the capacity for good or evil, for love or hatred, for patriotism or discontent, for the decomposition of virtue into vice, or the reverse, at any single moment in the soul of one of these its quiet servants, with the composed faces and the regulated actions.
<p/>So many hundred Hands in this Mill; so many hundred horse Steam Power. There is no mystery in it; there is an unfathomable mystery in the meanest of them, for ever.
<p/>- Supposing we were to reverse our arithmetic for material objects, and to govern these awful unknown quantities by other means!
<p/>The day grew strong, and showed itself outside, even against the flaming lights within. The lights were turned out, and the work went on.
<p/>In the waste-yard outside, the steam from the escape pipe, the litter of barrels and old iron, the shining heaps of coals, the ashes everywhere, were shrouded in a veil of mist and rain.
<p/>The rain fell, and the Smoke-serpents, submissive to the curse of all that tribe, trailed themselves upon the earth. The work went on, until the noon-bell rang.
<p/>More clattering upon the pavements. The looms, and wheels, and Hands all out of gear for an hour. Stephen came out of the hot mill into the damp wind and cold wet streets, haggard and worn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) turned from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own class and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own quarter, taking nothing but a little bread as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) walked along, towards the hill on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) principal employer lived, in a red house with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street door, up two white steps, BOUNDERBY -LRB-in letters very like himself-RRB- upon a brazen plate, and a round brazen door-handle underneath it, like a brazen full-stop.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby was at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) lunch. So Stephen had expected. Would his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) servant say that one of the Hands begged leave to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)?
<p/>Message in return, requiring name of such Hand. Stephen Blackpool. There was nothing troublesome against Stephen Blackpool; yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) might come in.
<p/>Stephen Blackpool in the parlour. Mr. Bounderby -LRB-whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) just knew by sight-RRB-, at lunch on chop and sherry. Mrs. Sparsit netting at the fireside, in a side-saddle attitude, with one foot in a cotton stirrup.
<p/>It was a part, at once of Mrs. Sparsit's dignity and service, not to lunch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) supervised the meal officially, but implied that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) own stately person she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) considered lunch a weakness. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, Stephen,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`what's the matter with you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>Stephen made a bow. Not a servile one - these Hands will never do that!
<p/>sir, you'll never catch them at that, if they have been with you twenty years! - and, as a complimentary toilet for Mrs. Sparsit, tucked his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) neckerchief ends into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) waistcoat. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, you know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, taking some sherry, <div class="bookquote">`we have never had any difficulty with you, and you have never been one of the unreasonable ones.
<p/>You don't expect to be set up in a coach and six, and to be fed on turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, as a good many of 'em do!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bounderby always represented this to be the sole, immediate, and direct object of any Hand who was not entirely satisfied; <div class="bookquote">`and therefore I know already that you have not come here to make a complaint.
<p/>Lord bless you, Now, you know, I am certain of that, beforehand.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, sir, sure I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>not coom for nowt o' th' kind.'
<p/>Mr. Bounderby seemed agreeably surprised, notwithstanding his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) previous strong conviction. <div class="bookquote">` Very well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) returned. <div class="bookquote">` You're a steady Hand, and I was not mistaken.
<p/>Now, let me hear what it's all about. As it's not that, let me hear what it is. What have you got to say?
<p/>I can go, Mr. Bounderby, if you wish it,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said that self-sacrificing lady, making a feint of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) foot out of the stirrup.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby stayed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), by holding a mouthful of chop in suspension before swallowing it, and putting out his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) left hand.
<p/>Then, withdrawing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hand and swallowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) mouthful of chop, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) said to Stephen: <div class="bookquote">`Now you know, this good lady is a born lady, a high lady.
<p/>You are not to suppose because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) keeps my house for me, that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hasn't been very high up the tree - ah, up at the top of the tree!
<p/>Now, if you have got anything to say that can't be said before a born lady, this lady will leave the room.
<p/>If what you have got to say can be said before a born lady, this lady will stay where she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is.'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Out with it, lad!'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>Stephen happened to glance towards Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` Sir, I hope I never had nowt to say, not fitten for a born lady to year, sin'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>I were born mysen',' was the reply, accompanied with a slight flush. <div class="bookquote">` Very well,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, pushing away his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) plate, and leaning back. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>I need <div class="bookquote">`t overmuch. I were married on Eas' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>r Monday nineteen year sin, long and dree. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were a young lass - pretty enow - wi' good accounts of herseln.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) took to drinking, left off working, sold the furniture, pawned the clothes, and played old Gooseberry.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I were patient

<p/>Every line in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) face deepened as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) said it, and put in its affecting evidence of the suffering he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had undergone. <div class="bookquote">`

She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) coom back, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) coom back, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) coom back. What could I do t' hinder her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?
<p/>I ha' walked the streets nights long, ere ever I'd go home. I ha' gone t' th' brigg, minded to fling myseln ower, and ha' no more on't.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit, easily ambling along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) netting-needles, raised the Coriolanian eyebrows and shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">`The great know trouble as well as the small.
<p/>I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>bore that much, that I were owd when I were young.' Please to turn your humble eye in My direction.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) to keep awa' fra' me. These five year I ha' paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>). I ha' gotten decent fewtrils about me agen.
<p/>I ha' lived hard and sad, but not ashamed and fearfo <div class="bookquote">` a'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>the minnits o' my life. Last night, I went home.
<p/>In the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) misfortune, and the energy of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) distress, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fired for the moment like a proud man.
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) lay upon my har-stone! There she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) is!' In another moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stood as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had stood all the time - his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) usual stoop upon him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>);
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pondering face addressed to Mr. Bounderby, with a curious expression on it, half shrewd, half perplexed, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) mind were set upon unravelling something very difficult; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hat held tight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) left hand, which rested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hip; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) right arm, with a rugged propriety and force of action, very earnestly emphasizing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) said: not least so when it always paused, a little bent, but not withdrawn, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I was acquainted with all this, you know,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`except the last clause, long ago. It's a bad job; that's what it is.
<p/>You had better have been satisfied as you were, and not have got married. However, it's too late to say that.'

<p/>I inferred, from its being so miserable a marriage, that it was probably an unequal one in point of years.'  (<font color='red'><b>Chief</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bounderby looked very hard at the good lady in a side-long way that had an odd sheepishness about it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) fortified himself with a little more sherry. <div class="bookquote">` Well? Why don't you go on?'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) then asked, turning rather irritably on Stephen Blackpool. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>coom to ask yo, sir, how I am to be ridded o' this woman.' Stephen infused a yet deeper gravity into the mixed expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) attentive face.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit uttered a gentle ejaculation, as having received a moral shock. <div class="bookquote">` What do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, getting up to lean his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) back against the chimney-piece. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What are you talking about? You took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) for better for worse.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why then, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, turning white, and motioning with that right hand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) gave everything to the four winds, ''tis a muddle. `

<p/>Now, you have always been a steady Hand hitherto; but my opinion is, and so I tell you plainly, that you are turning into the wrong road.
<p/>You have been listening to some mischievous stranger or other - they're always about - and the best thing you can do is, to come out of that.
<p/>Now you know;' here his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) countenance expressed marvellous acuteness; `I can see as far into a grindstone as another man; farther than a good many, perhaps, because I had my nose well kept to it when I was young.

<p/>CHAPTER XII - THE OLD WOMAN OLD STEPHEN descended the two white steps, shutting the black door with the brazen door-plate, by the aid of the brazen full-stop, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>STEPHEN</b></font>) gave a parting polish with the sleeve of his (<font color='blue'><b>STEPHEN</b></font>) coat, observing that his (<font color='blue'><b>STEPHEN</b></font>) hot hand clouded it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>STEPHEN</b></font>) crossed the street with his (<font color='blue'><b>STEPHEN</b></font>) eyes bent upon the ground, and thus was walking sorrowfully away, when he (<font color='blue'><b>STEPHEN</b></font>) felt a touch upon his (<font color='blue'><b>STEPHEN</b></font>) arm.
<p/>It was not the touch he (<font color='blue'><b>STEPHEN</b></font>) needed most at such a moment - the touch that could calm the wild waters of his (<font color='blue'><b>STEPHEN</b></font>) soul, as the uplifted hand of the sublimest love and patience could abate the raging of the sea - yet
<p/>Yes, I do!' cried Mr. Bounderby, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) head with obstinate cunning. <div class="bookquote">` By the Lord Harry, I do!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>it was a woman's hand too.
<p/>It was an old woman, tall and shapely still, though withered by time, on whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) eyes fell when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) stopped and turned.
<p/>The flutter of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manner, in the unwonted noise of the streets; the spare shawl, carried unfolded on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) arm; the heavy umbrella, and little basket; the loose long-fingered gloves, to which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hands were unused; all bespoke an old woman from the country, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) plain holiday clothes, come into Coketown on an expedition of rare occurrence.
<p/>Remarking this at a glance, with the quick observation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) class, Stephen Blackpool bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) attentive face - his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) face, which, like the faces of many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>) order, by dint of long working with eyes and hands in the midst of a prodigious noise, had acquired the concentrated look with which we are familiar in the countenances of the deaf - the better to hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Harry</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Pray, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, <div class="bookquote">`didn't I see you come out of that gentleman's house?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>pointing back to Mr. Bounderby's. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very cleanly and plainly dressed, had country mud upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shoes, and was newly come from a journey. I believe it was you, unless I have had the bad luck to mistake the person in following?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>Yes, missus, ` returned Stephen, <div class="bookquote">`it were me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Have you - you'll excuse an old woman's curiosity - have you seen the gentleman?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) straightened her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own figure, and held up her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head in adapting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) action to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words, the idea crossed Stephen that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had seen this old woman before, and had not quite liked her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, missus.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) look, sir? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) portly, bold, outspoken, and hearty?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>O yes,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) returned, observing her (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) more attentively, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) were all that.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) were ett'n and drinking - as large and as loud as a Hummobee.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Thank you!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, with infinite content. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And healthy,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, <div class="bookquote">`as the fresh wind?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>returned Stephen. <div class="bookquote">` Thank you!'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) certainly never had seen this old woman before.
<p/>Yet there was a vague remembrance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) mind, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had more than once dreamed of some old woman like her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) walked along at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) side, and, gently accommodating himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) humour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said Coketown was a busy place, was it not?
<p/>To which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered <div class="bookquote">`Eigh sure! Dreadful busy!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came from the country, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) saw? To which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered in the affirmative. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>By Parliamentary, this morning. I came forty mile by Parliamentary this morning, and I'm going back the same forty mile this afternoon.
<p/>I walked nine mile to the station this morning, and if I find nobody on the road to give me a lift, I shall walk the nine mile back to-night.
<p/>That's pretty well, sir, at my age!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the chatty old woman, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eye brightening with exultation. ` <div class="bookquote">` Deed 'tis.
<p/>Don't do' (<font color='red'><b>the woman eye</b></font>)</div>t too often, missus.' <div class="bookquote">` No, no. Once a year,'  (<font color='red'><b>missus</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) answered, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` I spend my savings so, once every year.
<p/>I come regular, to tramp about the streets, and see the gentlemen.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Only to see 'em?'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>returned Stephen. <div class="bookquote">` That's enough for me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) replied, with great earnestness and interest of manner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have been standing about, on this side of the way, to see that gentleman,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>turning her (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) head back towards Mr. Bounderby's again, <div class="bookquote">`come out.
<p/>Now, if I am obliged to go back without a glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) - I only want a glimpse - well!
<p/>I ask no more! But, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>)'s late this year, and I have not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>). You came out instead. I have seen you, and you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), and I must make that do.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Saying this, she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) looked at Stephen as if to fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) features in her (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) mind, and her (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) eye was not so bright as it had been.
<p/>With a large allowance for difference of tastes, and with all submission to the patricians of Coketown, this seemed so extraordinary a source of interest to take so much trouble about, that it perplexed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).
<p/>But they were passing the church now, and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) eye caught the clock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) quickened his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) pace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was going to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) work?
<p/>the old woman said, quickening hers, too, quite easily. Yes, time was nearly out. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) telling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) worked, the old woman became a more singular old woman than before. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) answered evasively, because the old woman appeared to take it for granted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) would be very happy indeed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had not the heart to disappoint her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knew that there was trouble enough in the world; and if the old woman had lived so long, and could count upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) having so little, why so much the better for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and none the worse for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>An't you happy?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Why - there's awmost nobbody but has their troubles, missus.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Ay, ay! You have your troubles at home, you mean?'
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">` Times. Just now and then,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) answered, slightly. <div class="bookquote">` But, working under such a gentleman, they don't follow you to the Factory?'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) did not go so far as to say, for her (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) pleasure, that there was a sort of Divine Right there; but, I have heard claims almost as magnificent of late years.-RRB-
<p/>No, no; they didn't follow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) there, said Stephen. All correct there. Everything accordant there. They were now in the black by-road near the place, and the Hands were crowding in.
<p/>The bell was ringing, and the Serpent was a Serpent of many coils, and the Elephant was getting ready. The strange old woman was delighted with the very bell.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) stopped good-naturedly to shake hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) before going in, how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had worked there? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was the beautifullest bell she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had ever heard, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said, and sounded grand! A dozen year,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I must kiss the hand,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`that has worked in this fine factory for a dozen year!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lifted it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) would have prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lips.
<p/>What harmony, besides her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) age and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) simplicity, surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) did not know, but even in this fantastic action there was a something neither out of time nor place: a something which it seemed as if nobody else could have made as serious, or done with such a natural and touching air.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had been at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) loom full half an hour, thinking about this old woman, when, having occasion to move round the loom for its adjustment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) glanced through a window which was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) corner, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) still looking up at the pile of building, lost in admiration.
<p/>Heedless of the smoke and mud and wet, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) two long journeys, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gazing at it, as if the heavy thrum that issued from its many stories were proud music to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was gone by and by, and the day went after her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and the lights sprung up again, and the Express whirled in full sight of the Fairy Palace over the arches near: little felt amid the jarring of the machinery, and scarcely heard above its crash and rattle.
<p/>Long before then his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thoughts had gone back to the dreary room above the little shop, and to the shameful figure heavy on the bed, but heavier on his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart.
<p/>The bell again; the glare of light and heat dispelled; the factories, looming heavy in the black wet night - their tall chimneys rising up into the air like competing Towers of Babel.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had spoken to Rachael only last night, it was true, and had walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) a little way; but he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) new misfortune on him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in which no one else could give him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a moment's relief, and, for the sake of it, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew himself to want that softening of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anger which no voice but hers could effect, he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) felt he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might so far disregard what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had said as to wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) again.
<p/>Machinery slackened; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse; stopped. He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) waited, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had eluded him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was gone. On no other night in the year could he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so ill have spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) patient face.
<p/>Better to have no home in which to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, than to have a home and dread to go to it, through such a cause.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ate and drank, for he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was exhausted - but he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) little knew or cared what; and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wandered about in the chill rain, thinking and thinking, and brooding and brooding.
<p/>No word of a new marriage had ever passed between them; but Rachael had taken great pity on him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) years ago, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) alone he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had opened his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) closed heart all this time, on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) miseries; and he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew very well that if he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were free to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) would take him (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought of the home he (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might at that moment have been seeking with pleasure and pride; of the different man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have been that night; of the lightness then in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now heavy- laden breast; of the then restored honour, self-respect, and tranquillity all torn to pieces.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought of the waste of the best part of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life, of the change it made in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character for the worse every day, of the dreadful nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) existence, bound hand and foot, to a dead woman, and tormented by a demon in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shape.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) thought of Rachael, how young when they were first brought together in these circumstances, how mature now, how soon to grow old.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) thought of the number of girls and women she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had seen marry, how many homes with children in them she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had seen grow up around her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), how she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had contentedly pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) own lone quiet path - for him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) - and how he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) had sometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) blessed face, that smote him (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) with remorse and despair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) set the picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) up, beside the infamous image of last night; and thought, Could it be, that the whole earthly course of one so gentle, good, and self-denying, was subjugate to such a wretch as that!
<p/>Filled with these thoughts - so filled that he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) had an unwholesome sense of growing larger, of being placed in some new and diseased relation towards the objects among which he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) passed, of seeing the iris round every misty light turn red - he (<font color='blue'><b>demon</b></font>) went home for shelter.
<p/>A CANDLE faintly burned in the window, to which the black ladder had often been raised for the sliding away of all that was most precious in this world to a striving wife and a brood of hungry babies; and Stephen added to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) other thoughts the stern reflection, that of all the casualties of this existence upon earth, not one was dealt out with so unequal a hand as Death.
<p/>For, say that the child of a King and the child of a Weaver were born to-night in the same moment, what was that disparity, to the death of any human creature who was serviceable to, or beloved by, another, while this abandoned woman lived on!
<p/>O! CHAPTER XIII - RACHAEL The inequality of Birth was nothing to it. From the outside of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) home he (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) gloomily passed to the inside, with suspended breath and with a slow footstep.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) went up to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) door, opened it, and so into the room. Quiet and peace were there. Rachael was there, sitting by the bed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) head, and the light of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) face shone in upon the midnight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) sat by the bed, watching and tending his (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) wife.
<p/>That is to say, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) saw that some one lay there, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) knew too well it must be she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>); but Rachael's hands had put a curtain up, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was screened from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Everything was in its place and order as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) had always kept it, the little fire was newly trimmed, and the hearth was freshly swept.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) disgraceful garments were removed, and some of Rachael's were in the room. It appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) saw all this in Rachael's face, and looked at nothing besides.
<p/>While looking at it, it was shut out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) view by the softened tears that filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) eyes; but not before he (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>) had seen how earnestly she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weaver</b></font>), and how her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) own eyes were filled too.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) turned again towards the bed, and satisfying herself that all was quiet there, spoke in a low, calm, cheerful voice. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am glad you have come at last, Stephen. You are very late.'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>been walking up an' down.' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I thought so. But 'tis too bad a night for that. The rain falls very heavy, and the wind has risen.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The wind? True. It was blowing hard. Hark to the thundering in the chimney, and the surging noise! To have been out in such a wind, and not to have known it was blowing! `
<p/>I have been here once before, to-day, Stephen. Landlady came round for me at dinner-time. There was some one here that needed looking to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>) said.
<p/>And <div class="bookquote">`deed she (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>) was right. All wandering and lost, Stephen. Wounded too, and bruised.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) slowly moved to a chair and sat down, drooping his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) head before her (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>). `
<p/>I came to do what little I could, Stephen; first, for that she (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>) worked with me when we were girls both, and for that you courted her (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>) and married her (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>) when I was her (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>) friend - `
<p/>And next, for that I know your heart, and am right sure and certain that 'tis far too merciful to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>) die, or even so much as suffer, for want of aid.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) furrowed forehead on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hand, with a low groan. <div class="bookquote">` Thou knowest who said, ``Let him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) who is without sin among you cast the first stone at her (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>)!
<p/>'' There have been plenty to do that. Thou art not the man to cast the last stone, Stephen, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Landlady</b></font>) is brought so low.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`O Rachael, Rachael!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Thou hast been a cruel sufferer, Heaven reward thee!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) said, in compassionate accents. <div class="bookquote">` I am thy poor friend, with all my heart and mind.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The wounds of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had spoken, seemed to be about the neck of the self-made outcast. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) dressed them now, still without showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) steeped a piece of linen in a basin, into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) poured some liquid from a bottle, and laid it with a gentle hand upon the sore.
<p/>It was not so far off, but that Stephen, following her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hands with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) eyes, could read what was printed on it in large letters.
<p/>The three-legged table had been drawn close to the bedside, and on it there were two bottles. This was one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) turned of a deadly hue, and a sudden horror seemed to fall upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I will stay here, Stephen,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Rachael, quietly resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) seat, 'till the bells go Three. <div class="bookquote">` Tis to be done again at three, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) may be left till morning.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

<p/>Tis thou who art in need of rest - so white and tired. Try to sleep in the chair there, while I watch.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) heard the thundering and surging out of doors, and it seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) late angry mood were going about trying to get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).
<p/>Thou hadst no sleep last night, I can well believe. To-morrow's work is far harder for thee than for me.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had cast it out; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would keep it out; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) trusted to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) from himself. `
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) don't know me, Stephen; she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) just drowsily mutters and stares. I have spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) times and again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) don't notice! <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) comes to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) right mind once more, I shall have done what I can, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never the wiser.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Tis as well so. `How long, Rachael, is <div class="bookquote">`t looked for, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)'ll be so?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Doctor said she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) would haply come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) mind to-morrow.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) eyes fell again on the bottle, and a tremble passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>), causing him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) to shiver in every limb. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) was chilled with the wet. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`it was not that. He (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) had had a fright.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` A fright?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>` Ay, ay! coming in. When I were walking.
<p/>When I - ` It seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) again; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) stood up, holding by the mantel-shelf, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) dank cold hair down with a hand that shook as if it were palsied. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When I were thinking. Stephen!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was coming to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) arm to stop her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` No!
<p/>Don't, please; don't. Let me see thee setten by the bed. Let me see thee, a'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>so good, and so forgiving.
<p/>Let me see thee as I see thee when I coom in. I can never see thee better than so. Never, never, never!'
<p/>After a time he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) controlled himself, and, resting with an elbow on one knee, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) head upon that hand, could look towards Rachael.
<p/>Seen across the dim candle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) moistened eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had a glory shining round her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) did believe it, as the noise without shook the window, rattled at the door below, and went about the house clamouring and lamenting. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) gets better, Stephen, 'tis to be hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)'ll leave thee to thyself again, and do thee no more hurt.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had a violent fit of trembling, and then sunk into his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) chair. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could have believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had. Anyways we will hope so now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) eyes, more to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) than to rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) weary head; but, by slow degrees as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) listened to the great noise of the wind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) ceased to hear it, or it changed into the working of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) loom, or even into the voices of the day -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own included-RRB- saying what had been really said.
<p/>And now I shall keep silence, for I want thee to sleep.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Even this imperfect consciousness faded away at last, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) dreamed a long, troubled dream.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and some one on whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) heart had long been set - but she (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was not Rachael, and that surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), even in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) imaginary happiness - stood in the church being married.
<p/>While the ceremony was performing, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) recognized among the witnesses some whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knew to be living, and many whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knew to be dead, darkness came on, succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light.
<p/>It broke from one line in the table of commandments at the altar, and illuminated the building with the words. They were sounded through the church, too, as if there were voices in the fiery letters.
<p/>Upon this, the whole appearance before him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) and around him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) changed, and nothing was left as it had been, but himself and the clergyman.
<p/>They stood in the daylight before a crowd so vast, that if all the people in the world could have been brought together into one space, they could not have looked, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) thought, more numerous; and they all abhorred him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), and there was not one pitying or friendly eye among the millions that were fastened on his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) face.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) stood on a raised stage, under his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) own loom; and, looking up at the shape the loom took, and hearing the burial service distinctly read, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was there to suffer death.
<p/>- Out of what mystery he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) came back to his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) usual life, and to places that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) knew, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was unable to consider; but he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was back in those places by some means, and with this condemnation upon him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was never, in this world or the next, through all the unimaginable ages of eternity, to look on Rachael's face or hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) voice.
<p/>Wandering to and fro, unceasingly, without hope, and in search of he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) knew not what -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) only knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was doomed to seek it-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was the subject of a nameless, horrible dread, a mortal fear of one particular shape which everything took.
<p/>In an instant what he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) stood on fell below him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was gone. Whatsoever he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) looked at, grew into that form sooner or later.
<p/>The object of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) miserable existence was to prevent its recognition by any one among the various people he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) encountered. Hopeless labour!
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) led them out of rooms where it was, if he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) shut up drawers and closets where it stood, if he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) drew the curious from places where he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) knew it to be secreted, and got them out into the streets, the very chimneys of the mills assumed that shape, and round them was the printed word.
<p/>The wind was blowing again, the rain was beating on the house-tops, and the larger spaces through which he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had strayed contracted to the four walls of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) room.
<p/>Saving that the fire had died out, it was as his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) eyes had closed upon it. Rachael seemed to have fallen into a doze, in the chair by the bed.
<p/>The table stood in the same place, close by the bedside, and on it, in its real proportions and appearance, was the shape so often repeated.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) sat wrapped in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) shawl, perfectly still. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) saw the curtain move. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) looked again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was sure it moved.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) saw a hand come forth and grope about a little. Then the curtain moved more perceptibly, and the woman in the bed put it back, and sat up.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) woful eyes, so haggard and wild, so heavy and large, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked all round the room, and passed the corner where he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) slept in his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) chair.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes returned to that corner, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand over them as a shade, while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked into it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) thought, as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) once more shaded them - not so much looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), as looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) with a brutish instinct that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was there - that no single trace was left in those debauched features, or in the mind that went along with them, of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had married eighteen years before.
<p/>But that he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) come to this by inches, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) never could have believed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be the same.
<p/>Again they went all round the room, scarcely heeding Rachael if at all, and returned to that corner. All this time, as if a spell were on him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was motionless and powerless, except to watch her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>).
<p/>Stupidly dozing, or communing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) incapable self about nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) sat for a little while with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hands at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) ears, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) head resting on them.
<p/>Presently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) staring round the room. And now, for the first time, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) eyes stopped at the table with the bottles on it.
<p/>Straightway she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) eyes back to his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) corner, with the defiance of last night, and moving very cautiously and softly, stretched out her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) greedy hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) drew a mug into the bed, and sat for a while considering which of the two bottles she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) should choose.
<p/>Finally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) insensate grasp upon the bottle that had swift and certain death in it, and, before his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) eyes, pulled out the cork with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) teeth.
<p/>Dream or reality, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had no voice, nor had he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) power to stir. If this be real, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) allotted time be not yet come, wake, Rachael, wake!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) thought of that, too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) looked at Rachael, and very slowly, very cautiously, poured out the contents. The draught was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) lips.
<p/>A moment and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) would be past all help, let the whole world wake and come about her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) with its utmost power.
<p/>But in that moment Rachael started up with a suppressed cry. The creature struggled, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) by the hair; but Rachael had the cup.
<p/>Stephen broke out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) chair. <div class="bookquote">` Rachael, am I wakin'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>or dreamin' this dreadfo' night?' '' Tis all well, Stephen.
<p/>I have been asleep, myself. <div class="bookquote">` Tis near three. Hush! I hear the bells.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The wind brought the sounds of the church clock to the window.
<p/>Stephen looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), saw how pale she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was, noted the disorder of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hair, and the red marks of fingers on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) forehead, and felt assured that his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) senses of sight and hearing had been awake.
<p/>I thought it must be near three,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) said, calmly pouring from the cup into the basin, and steeping the linen as before. `
<p/>They listened, and it struck three. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) held the cup in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hand even now. ` I am thankful I stayed! <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The few drops in the basin I'll pour away, for 'tis bad stuff to leave about, though ever so little of it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Tis done now, when I have put this on. There! And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)'s quiet again. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) drained the basin into the ashes of the fire, and broke the bottle on the hearth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had nothing to do, then, but to cover herself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) shawl before going out into the wind and rain. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thou`lt let me walk wi'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>thee at this hour, Rachael?' ` No, Stephen. <div class="bookquote">` Tis but a minute, and I'm home.'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thou`rt not fearfo' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>;' he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said it in a low voice, as they went out at the door; <div class="bookquote">`to leave me alone wi'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)!'
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) went down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knee before her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), on the poor mean stairs, and put an end of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) shawl to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) lips. `
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), saying, <div class="bookquote">`Stephen?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Thou art an Angel. Bless thee, bless thee!' <div class="bookquote">`I am, as I have told thee, Stephen, thy poor friend.
<p/>Angels are not like me. Between them, and a working woman fu'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>of faults, there is a deep gulf set. My little sister is among them, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is changed.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes for a moment as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said the words; and then they fell again, in all their gentleness and mildness, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thou mak`st me humbly wishfo'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>to be more like thee, and fearfo' to lose thee when this life is ower, and a' the muddle cleared awa'.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knee at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) feet, with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shawl still in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand, and the reproof on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) lips died away when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) saw the working of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thou changest me from bad to good. Thou`rt an Angel; it may be, thou hast saved my soul alive!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I coom home desp`rate.
<p/>I coom home wi'out a hope, and mad wi' thinking that when I said a word o' complaint I was reckoned a unreasonable Hand.
<p/>I told thee I had had a fright. It were the Poison-bottle on table. I never hurt a livin' creetur; but happenin' so suddenly upon <div class="bookquote">`t, I thowt,
<p/>``How can I say what I might ha'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>done to myseln, or her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), or both!'' ` She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) two hands on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mouth, with a face of terror, to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) from saying more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) caught them in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) unoccupied hand, and holding them, and still clasping the border of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shawl, said hurriedly: <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But I see thee, Rachael, setten by the bed. I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>seen thee, aw this night. In my troublous sleep I ha' known thee still to be there.
<p/>Evermore I will see thee there. I nevermore will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) or think o' her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), but thou shalt be beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>).
<p/>I nevermore will see or think o' anything that angers me, but thou, so much better than me, shalt be by th' side on't.
<p/>And so I will try t' look t' th' time, and so I will try t' trust t' th' time, when thou and me at last shall walk together far awa', beyond the deep gulf, in th' country where thy little sister is.'
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>) kissed the border of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) shawl again, and let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) go. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bade him (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>) good night in a broken voice, and went out into the street.
<p/>It had cleared the sky before it, and the rain had spent itself or travelled elsewhere, and the stars were bright.
<p/>The wind blew from the quarter where the day would soon appear, and still blew strongly. He (<font color='blue'><b>thou</b></font>) stood bare-headed in the road, watching her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) quick disappearance.
<p/>As the shining stars were to the heavy candle in the window, so was Rachael, in the rugged fancy of this man, to the common experiences of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life.
<p/>THE GREAT MANUFACTURER TIME went on in Coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought up, so much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.
<p/>But, less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its varying seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick, and made the only stand that ever was made in the place against its direful uniformity. `
<p/>Time, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) innumerable horse-power, worked away, not minding what anybody said, and presently turned out young Thomas a foot taller than when his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) father had last taken particular notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>CHAPTER XIV - Louisa is becoming,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`almost a young woman.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Thomas is becoming,' said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`almost a young man.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Time passed Thomas on in the mill, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) father was thinking about it, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stood in a long-tailed coat and a stiff shirt-collar. `
<p/>Time, sticking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) on into Bounderby's Bank, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) an inmate of Bounderby's house, necessitated the purchase of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) first razor, and exercised him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) diligently in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) calculations relative to number one.
<p/>The same great manufacturer, always with an immense variety of work on hand, in every stage of development, passed Sissy onward in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) mill, and worked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) up into a very pretty article indeed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Really,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`the period has arrived when Thomas ought to go to Bounderby.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>I fear, Jupe,' said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`that your continuance at the school any longer would be useless.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>I cannot disguise from you, Jupe,' said Mr. Gradgrind, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) brow, `that the result of your probation there has disappointed me; has greatly disappointed me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` I am afraid it would, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Sissy answered with a curtsey. <div class="bookquote">` You have not acquired, under Mr. and Mrs. M'Choakumchild, anything like that amount of exact knowledge which I looked for.
<p/>You are extremely deficient in your facts. Your acquaintance with figures is very limited. You are altogether backward, and below the mark.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am sorry, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) returned; <div class="bookquote">` but I know it is quite true. Yet I have tried hard, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`yes, I believe you have tried hard; I have observed you, and I can find no fault in that respect.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>I have thought sometimes;' Sissy very timid here; `that perhaps I tried to learn too much, and that if I had asked to be allowed to try a little less, I might have - ` `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Thank you, sir. No, Jupe, no,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) head in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) profoundest and most eminently practical way. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The course you pursued, you pursued according to the system - the system - and there is no more to be said about it.
<p/>I can only suppose that the circumstances of your early life were too unfavourable to the development of your reasoning powers, and that we began too late.
<p/>I wish I could have made a better acknowledgment, sir, of your kindness to a poor forlorn girl who had no claim upon you, and of your protection of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Don't shed tears,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>You are useful to Mrs. Gradgrind, and -LRB-in a generally pervading way-RRB- you are serviceable in the family also; so I understand from Miss Louisa, and, indeed, so I have observed myself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Thank you, sir, very much,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said Sissy, with a grateful curtsey. <div class="bookquote">` I therefore hope,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`that you can make yourself happy in those relations.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>`I should have nothing to wish, sir, if - ` <div class="bookquote">` I understand you,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind; <div class="bookquote">`you still refer to your father.
<p/>If your training in the science of arriving at exact results had been more successful, you would have been wiser on these points.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) really liked Sissy too well to have a contempt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>); otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) calculating powers in such very slight estimation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) must have fallen upon that conclusion.
<p/>Somehow or other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had become possessed by an idea that there was something in this girl which could hardly be set forth in a tabular form.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) capacity of definition might be easily stated at a very low figure, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mathematical knowledge at nothing; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was not sure that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had been required, for example, to tick her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) off into columns in a parliamentary return, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) would have quite known how to divide her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>I have heard from Miss Louisa that you still preserve that bottle. Well! I will say no more.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>In some stages of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) manufacture of the human fabric, the processes of Time are very rapid.
<p/>Young Thomas and Sissy being both at such a stage of their working up, these changes were effected in a year or two; while Mr. Gradgrind himself seemed stationary in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) course, and underwent no alteration.
<p/>Time hustled him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) into a little noisy and rather dirty machinery, in a by-comer, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) Member of Parliament for Coketown: one of the respected members for ounce weights and measures, one of the representatives of the multiplication table, one of the deaf honourable gentlemen, dumb honourable gentlemen, blind honourable gentlemen, lame honourable gentlemen, dead honourable gentlemen, to every other consideration.
<p/>Except one, which was apart from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) necessary progress through the mill. Else wherefore live we in a Christian land, eighteen hundred and odd years after our Master?
<p/>All this while, Louisa had been passing on, so quiet and reserved, and so much given to watching the bright ashes at twilight as they fell into the grate, and became extinct, that from the period when her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father had said she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was almost a young woman - which seemed but
<p/>yesterday - she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had scarcely attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) notice again, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) quite a young woman. <div class="bookquote">` Quite a young woman,'  (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, musing. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dear me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Soon after this discovery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) became more thoughtful than usual for several days, and seemed much engrossed by one subject.
<p/>On a certain night, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was going out, and Louisa came to bid him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) good-bye before his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) departure - as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was not to be home until late and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) would not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) again until the morning - he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) arms, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) kindest manner, and said: <div class="bookquote">`My dear Louisa, you are a woman!'
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) answered with the old, quick, searching look of the night when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was found at the Circus; then cast down her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, father.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` My dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`I must speak with you alone and seriously. Come to me in my room after breakfast to-morrow, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, father.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Your hands are rather cold, Louisa. Are you not well?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Quite well, father.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And cheerful?'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again, and smiled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) peculiar manner. `
<p/>So, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) and went away; and Louisa returned to the serene apartment of the haircutting character, and leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) elbow on her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hand, looked again at the short-lived sparks that so soon subsided into ashes. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am as cheerful, father, as I usually am, or usually have been.'  (<font color='red'><b>the character</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` That's well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. Are you there, Loo?
<p/>` said her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brother, looking in at the door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was quite a young gentleman of pleasure now, and not quite a prepossessing one. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, I have been otherwise engaged, Loo, in the evenings; and in the daytime old Bounderby has been keeping me at it rather.
<p/>Dear Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) answered, rising and embracing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`how long it is since you have been to see me!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>But I touch him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up with you when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) comes it too strong, and so we preserve an understanding.
<p/>I say! Has father said anything particular to you to-day or yesterday, Loo?' <div class="bookquote">` No, Tom. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) told me to-night that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) wished to do so in the morning.'  (<font color='red'><b>yesterday Loo</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah! That's what I mean,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">` Do you know where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is to- night?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>- with a very deep expression. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Then I'll tell you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'s with old Bounderby. They are having a regular confab together up at the Bank. Why at the Bank, do you think?
<p/>Well, I'll tell you again. To keep Mrs. Sparsit's ears as far off as possible, I expect.'  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) brother's shoulder, Louisa still stood looking at the fire.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brother glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face with greater interest than usual, and, encircling her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) waist with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arm, drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) coaxingly to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are very fond of me, an't you, Loo?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Indeed I am, Tom, though you do let such long intervals go by without coming to see me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Well, sister of mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">`when you say that, you are near my thoughts. We might be so much oftener together -
<p/>mightn't we? Always together, almost - mightn't we? It would do me a great deal of good if you were to make up your mind to
<p/>I know what, Loo. It would be a splendid thing for me. It would be uncommonly jolly!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) thoughtfulness baffled his (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) cunning scrutiny.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) could make nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) face. He (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) arm, and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cheek. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) returned the kiss, but still looked at the fire. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I say, Loo! I thought I'd come, and just hint to you what was going on: though I supposed you'd most likely guess, even if you didn't know.
<p/>I can't stay, because I'm engaged to some fellows to- night. You won't forget how fond you are of me?'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) an affectionate good-night, and went out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) to the door, whence the fires of Coketown could be seen, making the distance lurid.
<p/>No, dear Tom, I won't forget.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` That's a capital girl,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">` Good-bye, Loo.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood there, looking steadfastly towards them, and listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) departing steps.
<p/>They retreated quickly, as glad to get away from Stone Lodge; and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood there yet, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) was gone and all was quiet.
<p/>It seemed as if, first in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own fire within the house, and then in the fiery haze without, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) tried to discover what kind of woof Old Time,
<p/>that greatest and longest- established Spinner of all, would weave from the threads he (<font color='blue'><b>Spinner</b></font>) had already spun into a woman. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinner</b></font>) factory is a secret place, his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinner</b></font>) work is noiseless, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Spinner</b></font>) Hands are mutes.
<p/>CHAPTER XV - FATHER AND DAUGHTER ALTHOUGH Mr. Gradgrind did not take after Blue Beard , his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) room was quite a blue chamber in its abundance of blue books.
<p/>Whatever they could prove -LRB-which is usually anything you like-RRB-, they proved there, in an army constantly strengthening by the arrival of new recruits.
<p/>In that charmed apartment, the most complicated social questions were cast up, got into exact totals, and finally settled - if those concerned could only have been brought to know it.
<p/>As if an astronomical observatory should be made without any windows, and the astronomer within should arrange the starry universe solely by pen, ink, and paper, so Mr. Gradgrind, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) Observatory
<p/>-LRB-and there are many like it-RRB-, had no need to cast an eye upon the teeming myriads of human beings around him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), but could settle all their destinies on a slate, and wipe out all their tears with one dirty little bit of sponge.
<p/>To this Observatory, then: a stern room, with a deadly statistical clock in it, which measured every second with a beat like a rap upon a coffin-lid; Louisa repaired on the appointed morning.
<p/>A window looked towards Coketown; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sat down near her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father's table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) saw the high chimneys and the long tracts of smoke looming in the heavy distance gloomily. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear Louisa,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">`I prepared you last night to give me your serious attention in the conversation we are now going to have together.
<p/>You have been so well trained, and you do, I am happy to say, so much justice to the education you have received, that I have perfect confidence in your good sense.
<p/>You are not impulsive, you are not romantic, you are accustomed to view everything from the strong dispassionate ground of reason and calculation.
<p/>From that ground alone, I know you will view and consider what I am going to communicate.'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) waited, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would have been glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said something.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said never a word. <div class="bookquote">` Louisa, my dear, you are the subject of a proposal of marriage that has been made to me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) waited, and again she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) answered not one word. This so far surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), as to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gently to repeat, <div class="bookquote">`a proposal of marriage, my dear.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Well!' said Mr. Gradgrind, breaking into a smile, after being for the moment at a loss, `you are even more dispassionate than I expected, Louisa.
<p/>To which she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) returned, without any visible emotion whatever: <div class="bookquote">`I hear you, father. I am attending, I assure you.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Or, perhaps, you are not unprepared for the announcement I have it in charge to make?'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I cannot say that, father, until I hear it. Prepared or unprepared, I wish to hear it all from you. I wish to hear you state it to me, father.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took a paper-knife in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand, turned it over, laid it down, took it up again, and even then had to look along the blade of it, considering how to go on. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Strange to relate, Mr. Gradgrind was not so collected at this moment as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) daughter was. What you say, my dear Louisa, is perfectly reasonable.
<p/>I have undertaken then to let you know that - in short, that Mr. Bounderby has informed me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) has long watched your progress with particular interest and pleasure, and has long hoped that the time might ultimately arrive when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) should offer you his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hand in marriage.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby has made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) proposal of marriage to me, and has entreated me to make it known to you, and to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hope that you will take it into your favourable consideration.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>That time, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) has so long, and certainly with great constancy, looked forward, is now come. Silence between them.
<p/>The deadly statistical clock very hollow. The distant smoke very black and heavy. <div class="bookquote">` Father,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, <div class="bookquote">`do you think I love Mr. Bounderby?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gradgrind was extremely discomfited by this unexpected question. <div class="bookquote">` Well, my child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">`I - really - cannot take upon myself to say.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Father,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>pursued Louisa in exactly the same voice as before, <div class="bookquote">`do you ask me to love Mr. Bounderby?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` My dear Louisa, no.
<p/>No. I ask nothing.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Father,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) still pursued, <div class="bookquote">`does Mr. Bounderby ask me to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Really, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, `it is difficult to answer your question - ` <div class="bookquote">`Difficult to answer it, Yes
<p/>Because;'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>here was something to demonstrate, and it set him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) up again; `because the reply depends so materially, Louisa, on the sense in which we use the expression.
<p/>Now, Mr. Bounderby does not do you the injustice, and does not do himself the injustice, of pretending to anything fanciful, fantastic, or -LRB-I am using synonymous terms-RRB- sentimental.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby would have seen you grow up under his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) eyes, to very little purpose, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) could so far forget what is due to your good sense, not to say to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), as to address you from any such ground.
<p/>or No, father? <div class="bookquote">` Certainly, my dear. Therefore, perhaps the expression itself - I merely suggest this to you, my dear - may be a little misplaced.'
 (<font color='red'><b>No father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, my dear Louisa,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, completely recovered by this time, `I would advise you -LRB-since you ask me-RRB- to consider this question, as you have been accustomed to consider every other question, simply as one of tangible Fact.
<p/>The ignorant and the giddy may embarrass such subjects with irrelevant fancies, and other absurdities that have no existence, properly viewed - really no existence - but it is no compliment to you to say, that you know better.
<p/>You are, we will say in round numbers, twenty years of age; Mr. Bounderby is, we will say in round numbers, fifty.
<p/>There is some disparity in your respective years, but in your means and positions there is none; on the contrary, there is a great suitability.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`What would you advise me to use in its stead, father?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Now, what are the Facts of this case? Then the question arises,
<p/>In considering this question, it is not unimportant to take into account the statistics of marriage, so far as they have yet been obtained, in England and Wales.
<p/>I find, on reference to the figures, that a large proportion of these marriages are contracted between parties of very unequal ages, and that the elder of these contracting parties is, in rather more than three-fourths of these instances, the bridegroom.
<p/>It is remarkable as showing the wide prevalence of this law, that among the natives of the British possessions in India, also in a considerable part of China, and among the Calmucks of Tartary, the best means of computation yet furnished us by travellers, yield similar results.
<p/>Is this one disparity sufficient to operate as a bar to such a marriage? The disparity I have mentioned, therefore, almost ceases to be disparity, and -LRB-virtually-RRB- all but disappears.'
<p/>What do you recommend, father,' asked Louisa, her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) reserved composure not in the least affected by these gratifying results, `that I should substitute for the term I used just now?
<p/>Confining yourself rigidly to Fact, the question of Fact you state to yourself is: Does Mr. Bounderby ask me to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>)?
<p/><div class="bookquote">` For the misplaced expression?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Louisa,'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">`it appears to me that nothing can be plainer. Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) does.
<p/>The sole remaining question then is: Shall I marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)? I think nothing can be plainer than that?'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Shall I marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>repeated Louisa, with great deliberation. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And it is satisfactory to me, as your father, my dear Louisa, to know that you do not come to the consideration of that question with the previous habits of mind, and habits of life, that belong to many young women.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Precisely. No, father,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">`I do not.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I now leave you to judge for yourself,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have stated the case, as such cases are usually stated among practical minds; I have stated it, as the case of your mother and myself was stated in its time.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) now leaned back in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) chair, and bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) deep-set eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) turn, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) might have seen one wavering moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was impelled to throw herself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) breast, and give him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) the pent-up confidences of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heart.
<p/>But, to see it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) must have overleaped at a bound the artificial barriers he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had for many years been erecting, between himself and all those subtle essences of humanity which will elude the utmost cunning of algebra until the last trumpet ever to be sounded
<p/>The rest, my dear Louisa, is for you to decide.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>From the beginning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had sat looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) fixedly. shall blow even algebra to wreck.
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) unbending, utilitarian, matter-of-fact face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hardened her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) again; and the moment shot away into the plumbless depths of the past, to mingle with all the lost opportunities that are drowned there.
<p/>Removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sat so long looking silently towards the town, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) said, at length: <div class="bookquote">`Are you consulting the chimneys of the Coketown works, Louisa?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The barriers were too many and too high for such a leap. There seems to be nothing there but languid and monotonous smoke.
<p/>Yet when the night comes, Fire bursts out, father!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) answered, turning quickly. <div class="bookquote">` Of course I know that, Louisa. I do not see the application of the remark.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) passed it away with a slight motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hand, and concentrating her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) attention upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) again, said, <div class="bookquote">`Father, I have often thought that life is very short.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>To do him (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) justice he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) did not, at all. - This was so distinctly one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) subjects that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) interposed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is short, no doubt, my dear. Still, the average duration of human life is proved to have increased of late years.
<p/>The calculations of various life assurance and annuity offices, among other figures which cannot go wrong, have established the fact.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I speak of my own life, father.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Still,' said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`I need not point out to you, Louisa, that it is governed by the laws which govern lives in the aggregate.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>` O indeed? <div class="bookquote">`While it lasts, I would wish to do the little I can, and the little I am fit for.

<p/>What does it matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gradgrind seemed rather at a loss to understand the last four words; replying, <div class="bookquote">`How, matter? The question I have to ask myself is, shall I marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>)?
<p/>That is so, father, is it not? You have told me so, father. Have you not?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Certainly, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Let it be so.
<p/>Since Mr. Bounderby likes to take me thus, I am satisfied to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) proposal. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), father, as soon as you please, that this was my answer.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It is quite right, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>retorted her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) father approvingly, <div class="bookquote">`to be exact.

(<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gradgrind had drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) chair a little nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and taken her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) paused to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and, still holding her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hand, said: <div class="bookquote">`Louisa, I have not considered it essential to ask you one question, because the possibility implied in it appeared to me to be too remote.

<p/>What do I know, father,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Louisa in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) quiet manner, <div class="bookquote">`of tastes and fancies; of aspirations and affections; of all that part of my nature in which such light things might have been nourished?
<p/>You correct me justly. I merely wished to discharge my duty.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What escape have I had from problems that could be demonstrated, and realities that could be grasped?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) said it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) unconsciously closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hand, as if upon a solid object, and slowly opened it as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) were releasing dust or ash. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>assented her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eminently practical parent, <div class="bookquote">`quite true, quite true.'  (<font color='red'><b>parent</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why, father,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">`what a strange question to ask me!
<p/>The baby-preference that even I have heard of as common among children, has never had its innocent resting-place in my breast.
<p/>You have been so careful of me, that I never had a child's heart. You have trained me so well, that I never dreamed a child's dream.
<p/>You have dealt so wisely with me, father, from my cradle to this hour, that I never had a child's belief or a child's fear.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gradgrind was quite moved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) success, and by this testimony to it. <div class="bookquote">` My dear Louisa,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), `you abundantly repay my care.
<p/>Detaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) embrace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`I may assure you now, my favourite child, that I am made happy by the sound decision at which you have arrived.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby is a very remarkable man; and what little disparity can be said to exist between you - if any - is more than counterbalanced by the tone your mind has acquired.
<p/>It has always been my object so to educate you, as that you might, while still in your early youth, be -LRB-if I may so express myself-RRB- almost any age.
<p/>Kiss me, my dear girl.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) daughter kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>). Kiss me once more, Louisa. Now, let us go and find your mother.'
<p/>Accordingly, they went down to the drawing-room, where the esteemed lady with no nonsense about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), was recumbent as usual, while Sissy worked beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) gave some feeble signs of returning animation when they entered, and presently the faint transparency was presented in a sitting attitude. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mrs. Gradgrind,'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) husband, who had waited for the achievement of this feat with some impatience, <div class="bookquote">`allow me to present to you Mrs. Bounderby.'
 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, I'm sure I hope your health may be good, Louisa; for if your head begins to split as soon as you are married, which was the case with mine, I cannot consider that you are to be envied, though I have no doubt you think you are, as all girls do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>all girls</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`so you have settled it! However, I give you joy, my dear - and I hope you may now turn all your ological studies to good account, I am sure I do!
<p/>I must give you a kiss of congratulation, Louisa; but don't touch my right shoulder, for there's something running down it all day long.
<p/>And now you see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>whimpered Mrs. Gradgrind, adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) shawls after the affectionate ceremony, <div class="bookquote">`I shall be worrying myself, morning, noon, and night, to know what I am to call him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mrs. Gradgrind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) husband, solemnly, <div class="bookquote">`what do you mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Whatever I am to call him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), Mr. Gradgrind, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) is married to Louisa!
<p/>It's impossible,'  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gradgrind, with a mingled sense of politeness and injury, `to be constantly addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) and never giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) a name.
<p/>I must call him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) something. I cannot call him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) Josiah, for the name is insupportable to me. You yourself wouldn't hear of Joe, you very well know.
<p/>Not, I believe, unless the time has arrived when, as an invalid, I am to be trampled upon by my relations.
<p/>Nobody present having any suggestion to offer in the remarkable emergency, Mrs. Gradgrind departed this life for the time being, after delivering the following codicil to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) remarks already executed: <div class="bookquote">`As to the wedding, all I ask, Louisa, is, - and I ask it with a fluttering in my chest, which actually extends to the soles of my feet, - that it may take place soon.
<p/>Am I to call my own son- in-law, Mister! Then, what am I to call him (<font color='blue'><b>in-law</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Otherwise, I know it is one of those subjects I shall never hear the last of.'
<p/>When Mr. Gradgrind had presented Mrs. Bounderby, Sissy had suddenly turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) head, and looked, in wonder, in pity, in sorrow, in doubt, in a multitude of emotions, towards Louisa.
<p/>Louisa had known it, and seen it, without looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). From that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was impassive, proud and cold - held Sissy at a distance - changed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) altogether.
<p/>CHAPTER XVI - HUSBAND AND WIFE MR. BOUNDERBY'S first disquietude on hearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>BOUNDERBY</b></font>) happiness, was occasioned by the necessity of imparting it to Mrs. Sparsit.
<p/>Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) would instantly depart, bag and baggage, to Lady Scadgers, or would positively refuse to budge from the premises; whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Scadgers</b></font>) would be plaintive or abusive, tearful or tearing; whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Scadgers</b></font>) would break her (<font color='blue'><b>Scadgers</b></font>) heart, or break the looking- glass; Mr. Bounderby could not all foresee.
<p/>However, as it must be done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had no choice but to do it; so, after attempting several letters, and failing in them all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) resolved to do it by word of mouth.
<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) way home, on the evening he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) set aside for this momentous purpose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) took the precaution of stepping into a chemist's shop and buying a bottle of the very strongest smelling-salts. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>By George!'  (<font color='red'><b>a chemist</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) takes it in the fainting way, I'll have the skin off her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) nose, at all events!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>But, in spite of being thus forearmed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) own house with anything but a courageous air; and appeared before the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) misgivings, like a dog who was conscious of coming direct from the pantry. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) could not make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) mind how to do that, or what the consequences of the step might be. Good evening, Mr. Bounderby!'
 (<font color='red'><b>a dog</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Good evening, ma'am, good evening.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) drew up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) chair, and Mrs. Sparsit drew back hers, as who should say, <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your fireside, sir. I freely admit it. It is for you to occupy it all, if you think proper.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Don't go to the North Pole, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby. `
<p/>Mr. Bounderby sat looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), as, with the points of a stiff, sharp pair of scissors, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) picked out holes for some inscrutable ornamental purpose, in a piece of cambric.
<p/>An operation which, taken in connexion with the bushy eyebrows and the Roman nose, suggested with some liveliness the idea of a hawk engaged upon the eyes of a tough little bird.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was so steadfastly occupied, that many minutes elapsed before she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) work; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) did so Mr. Bounderby bespoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) attention with a hitch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) pockets, and assuring himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) right hand that the cork of the little bottle was ready for use, <div class="bookquote">`I have no occasion to say to you, that you are not only a lady born and bred, but a devilish sensible woman.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned the lady, <div class="bookquote">`this is indeed not the first time that you have honoured me with similar expressions of your good opinion.'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thank you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, and returned, though short of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) former position. Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am,' said Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`I am going to astonish you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, interrogatively, and in the most tranquil manner possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) generally wore mittens, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) now laid down her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) work, and smoothed those mittens. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am going, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`to marry Tom Gradgrind's daughter.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit. ` I hope you may be happy, Mr. Bounderby.
<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) said it with such great condescension as well as with such great compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), that Bounderby, - far more disconcerted than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) workbox at the mirror, or swooned on the hearthrug, - corked up the smelling-salts tight in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) pocket, and thought, <div class="bookquote">`Now confound this woman, who could have even guessed that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would take it in this way!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I wish with all my heart, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, in a highly superior manner; somehow she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) seemed, in a moment, to have established a right to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) ever afterwards; <div class="bookquote">`that you may be in all respects very happy.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, ma'am,' returned Bounderby, with some resentment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) tone: which was clearly lowered, though in spite of himself, <div class="bookquote">`I am obliged to you.
<p/>Oh, indeed I hope you may be happy, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I hope I shall be.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Do you, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, with great affability. `
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit sedately resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) work and occasionally gave a small cough, which sounded like the cough of conscious strength and forbearance. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>resumed Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`under these circumstances, I imagine it would not be agreeable to a character like yours to remain here, though you would be very welcome here.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>But naturally you do; of course you do.' A very awkward pause on Mr. Bounderby's part, succeeded. <div class="bookquote">` Oh, dear no, sir, I could on no account think of that!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sparsit shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head, still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) highly superior manner, and a little changed the small cough - coughing now, as if the spirit of prophecy rose within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), but had better be coughed down. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>However, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, `there are apartments at the Bank, where a born and bred lady, as keeper of the place, would be rather a catch than otherwise; and if the same terms - ` <div class="bookquote">`I beg your pardon, sir.
<p/>You were so good as to promise that you would always substitute the phrase, annual compliment.'  (<font color='red'><b>keeper</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, ma'am, annual compliment.
<p/>If the same annual compliment would be acceptable there, why, I see nothing to part us, unless you do.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit. `
<p/>The proposal is like yourself, and if the position I shall assume at the Bank is one that I could occupy without descending lower in the social scale - ` <div class="bookquote">`Why, of course it is,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If it was not, ma'am, you don't suppose that I should offer it to a lady who has moved in the society you have moved in.
<p/>You'll have your own private apartments, and you'll have your coals and your candles, and all the rest of it, and you'll have your maid to attend upon you, and you'll have your light porter to protect you, and you'll be what I take the liberty of considering precious comfortable,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not that I care for such society, you know! But you do.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Mr. Bounderby, you are very considerate.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`say no more.
<p/>In yielding up my trust here, I shall not be freed from the necessity of eating the bread of dependence:'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) might have said the sweetbread, for that delicate article in a savoury brown sauce was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) favourite supper: <div class="bookquote">`and I would rather receive it from your hand, than from any other.
<p/>And I hope, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, concluding in an impressively compassionate manner, <div class="bookquote">`I fondly hope that Miss Gradgrind may be all you desire, and deserve!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Therefore, sir, I accept your offer gratefully, and with many sincere acknowledgments for past favours. Nothing moved Mrs. Sparsit from that position any more.
<p/>It was in vain for Bounderby to bluster or to assert himself in any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) explosive ways; Mrs. Sparsit was resolved to have compassion on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), as a Victim.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was polite, obliging, cheerful, hopeful; but, the more polite, the more obliging, the more cheerful, the more hopeful, the more exemplary altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>); the forlorner Sacrifice and Victim, he (<font color='blue'><b>Victim</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had that tenderness for his (<font color='blue'><b>Victim</b></font>) melancholy fate, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Victim</b></font>) great red countenance used to break out into cold perspirations when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Victim</b></font>).
<p/>Meanwhile the marriage was appointed to be solemnized in eight weeks' time, and Mr. Bounderby went every evening to Stone Lodge as an accepted wooer.
<p/>Love was made on these occasions in the form of bracelets; and, on all occasions during the period of betrothal, took a manufacturing aspect.
<p/>Dresses were made, jewellery was made, cakes and gloves were made, settlements were made, and an extensive assortment of Facts did appropriate honour to the contract.
<p/>The Hours did not go through any of those rosy performances, which foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times; neither did the clocks go any faster, or any slower, than at other seasons.
<p/>The deadly statistical recorder in the Gradgrind observatory knocked every second on the head as it was born, and buried it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) accustomed regularity.
<p/>So the day came, as all other days come to people who will only stick to reason; and when it came, there were married in the church of the florid wooden legs - that popular order of architecture - Josiah Bounderby Esquire of Coketown, to Louisa eldest daughter of Thomas Gradgrind Esquire of Stone Lodge, M.P. for that borough.
<p/>The business was all Fact, from first to last. And when they were united in holy matrimony, they went home to breakfast at Stone Lodge aforesaid.
<p/>There was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms, whether native or foreign, and all about it.
<p/>The bridesmaids, down to little Jane Gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit helpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of the company.
<p/>Since you have done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness, I suppose I must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and know what I am, and what my extraction was, you won't expect a speech from a man who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees a Post, says ``that's a Post,'' and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees a Pump, says ``that's a Pump,'' and is not to be got to call a Post a Pump, or a Pump a Post, or either of them a Toothpick.
<p/>If you want a speech this morning, my friend and father-in-law, Tom Gradgrind, is a Member of Parliament, and you know where to get it.
<p/>After breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms: `Ladies and gentlemen, I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. I am not your man.
<p/>However, if I feel a little independent when I look around this table to-day, and reflect how little I thought of marrying Tom Gradgrind's daughter when I was a ragged street-boy, who never washed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) face unless it was at a pump, and that not oftener than once a fortnight, I hope I may be excused.
<p/>So, I hope you like my feeling independent; if you don't, I can't help it. I do feel independent. Now I have mentioned, and you have mentioned, that I am this day married to Tom Gradgrind's daughter.
<p/>I am very glad to be so. It has long been my wish to be so. I have watched her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bringing-up, and I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is worthy of me.
<p/>So, I thank you, on both our parts, for the good-will you have shown towards us; and the best wish I can give the unmarried part of the present company, is this:
<p/>At the same time - not to deceive you - I believe I am worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). I hope every bachelor may find as good a wife as I have found.
<p/>Shortly after which oration, as they were going on a nuptial trip to Lyons, in order that Mr. Bounderby might take the opportunity of seeing how the Hands got on in those parts, and whether they, too, required to be fed with gold spoons; the happy pair departed for the railroad.
<p/>The bride, in passing down-stairs, dressed for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) journey, found Tom waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) - flushed, either with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) feelings, or the vinous part of the breakfast. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And I hope every spinster may find as good a husband as my wife has found.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>What a game girl you are, to be such a first-rate sister, Loo!' whispered Tom.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) clung to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should have clung to some far better nature that day, and was a little shaken in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) reserved composure for the first time. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Old Bounderby's quite ready,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">` Time's up. Good-bye! I shall be on the look-out for you, when you come back.
<p/>I say, my dear Loo! AN'T it uncommonly jolly now!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>END OF THE FIRST BOOK BOOK THE SECOND - REAPING CHAPTER I - EFFECTS IN THE BANK
<p/>Seen from a distance in such weather, Coketown lay shrouded in a haze of its own, which appeared impervious to the sun's rays.
<p/>You only knew the town was there, because you knew there could have been no such sulky blotch upon the prospect without a town.
<p/>A blur of soot and smoke, now confusedly tending this way, now that way, now aspiring to the vault of Heaven, now murkily creeping along the earth, as the wind rose and fell, or changed its quarter: a dense formless jumble, with sheets of cross light in it, that showed nothing but masses of darkness:- Coketown in the distance was suggestive of itself, though not a brick of it could be seen.
<p/>A SUNNY midsummer day. There was such a thing sometimes, even in Coketown. The wonder was, it was there at all.
<p/>It had been ruined so often, that it was amazing how it had borne so many shocks. Surely there never was such fragile china-ware as that of which the millers of Coketown were made.
<p/>Handle them never so lightly, and they fell to pieces with such ease that you might suspect them of having been flawed before.
<p/>They were ruined, when they were required to send labouring children to school; they were ruined when inspectors were appointed to look into their works; they were ruined, when such inspectors considered it doubtful whether they were quite justified in chopping people up with their machinery; they were utterly undone, when it was hinted that perhaps they need not always make quite so much smoke.
<p/>Besides Mr. Bounderby's gold spoon which was generally received in Coketown, another prevalent fiction was very popular there. It took the form of a threat.
<p/>Whenever a Coketowner felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was ill-used - that is to say, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was not left entirely alone, and it was proposed to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) accountable for the consequences of any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) acts -
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was sure to come out with the awful menace, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would <div class="bookquote">`sooner pitch his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) property into the Atlantic.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This had terrified the Home Secretary within an inch of his (<font color='blue'><b>Secretary</b></font>) life, on several occasions.
<p/>However, the Coketowners were so patriotic after all, that they never had pitched their property into the Atlantic yet, but, on the contrary, had been kind enough to take mighty good care of it.
<p/>The streets were hot and dusty on the summer day, and the sun was so bright that it even shone through the heavy vapour drooping over Coketown, and could not be looked at steadily.
<p/>Stokers emerged from low underground doorways into factory yards, and sat on steps, and posts, and palings, wiping their swarthy visages, and contemplating coals.
<p/>So there it was, in the haze yonder; and it increased and multiplied. The whole town seemed to be frying in oil.
<p/>The steam- engines shone with it, the dresses of the Hands were soiled with it, the mills throughout their many stories oozed and trickled it.
<p/>The atmosphere of those Fairy palaces was like the breath of the simoom: and their inhabitants, wasting with heat, toiled languidly in the desert.
<p/>There was a stifling smell of hot oil everywhere. But no temperature made the melancholy mad elephants more mad or more sane.
<p/>Their wearisome heads went up and down at the same rate, in hot weather and cold, wet weather and dry, fair weather and foul.
<p/>The measured motion of their shadows on the walls, was the substitute Coketown had to show for the shadows of rustling woods; while, for the summer hum of insects, it could offer, all the year round, from the dawn of Monday to the night of Saturday, the whirr of shafts and wheels.
<p/>Drowsily they whirred all through this sunny day, making the passenger more sleepy and more hot as he (<font color='blue'><b>passenger</b></font>) passed the humming walls of the mills.
<p/>Sun-blinds, and sprinklings of water, a little cooled the main streets and the shops; but the mills, and the courts and alleys, baked at a fierce heat.
<p/>Down upon the river that was black and thick with dye, some Coketown boys who were at large - a rare sight there - rowed a crazy boat, which made a spumous track upon the water as it jogged along, while every dip of an oar stirred up vile smells.
<p/>But the sun itself, however beneficent, generally, was less kind to Coketown than hard frost, and rarely looked intently into any of its closer regions without engendering more death than life.
<p/>So does the eye of Heaven itself become an evil eye, when incapable or sordid hands are interposed between it and the things it looks upon to bless.
<p/>Office-hours were over: and at that period of the day, in warm weather, she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) usually embellished with her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) genteel presence, a managerial board-room over the public office.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) own private sitting-room was a story higher, at the window of which post of observation she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) was ready, every morning, to greet Mr. Bounderby, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) came across the road, with the sympathizing recognition appropriate to a Victim.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) afternoon apartment at the Bank, on the shadier side of the frying street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Victim</b></font>) had been married now a year; and Mrs. Sparsit had never released him (<font color='blue'><b>Victim</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) determined pity a moment.
<p/>It was another red brick house, with black outside shutters, green inside blinds, a black street-door up two white steps, a brazen door-plate, and a brazen door-handle full stop.
<p/>It was a size larger than Mr. Bounderby's house, as other houses were from a size to half-a-dozen sizes smaller; in all other particulars, it was strictly according to pattern.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit was conscious that by coming in the evening-tide among the desks and writing implements, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) shed a feminine, not to say also aristocratic, grace upon the office.
<p/>Seated, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) needlework or netting apparatus, at the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had a self- laudatory sense of correcting, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) ladylike deportment, the rude business aspect of the place.
<p/>The Bank offered no violence to the wholesome monotony of the town. With this impression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) interesting character upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), Mrs. Sparsit considered herself, in some sort, the Bank Fairy.
<p/>The townspeople who, in their passing and repassing, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) there, regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) as the Bank Dragon keeping watch over the treasures of the mine.
<p/>Gold and silver coin, precious paper, secrets that if divulged would bring vague destruction upon vague persons -LRB-generally, however, people whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) disliked-RRB-, were the chief items in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) ideal catalogue thereof.
<p/>For the rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) knew that after office- hours, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) reigned supreme over all the office furniture, and over a locked-up iron room with three locks, against the door of which strong chamber the light porter laid his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) head every night, on a truckle bed, that disappeared at cockcrow.
<p/>Further, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairy</b></font>) was lady paramount over certain vaults in the basement, sharply spiked off from communication with the predatory world; and over the relics of the current day's work, consisting of blots of ink, worn-out pens, fragments of wafers, and scraps of paper torn so small, that nothing interesting could ever be deciphered on them when Mrs. Sparsit tried.
<p/>Lastly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was guardian over a little armoury of cutlasses and carbines, arrayed in vengeful order above one of the official chimney-pieces; and over that respectable tradition never to be separated from a place of business claiming to be wealthy - a row of fire-buckets - vessels calculated to be of no physical utility on any occasion, but observed to exercise a fine moral influence, almost equal to bullion, on most beholders.
<p/>What those treasures were, Mrs. Sparsit knew as little as they did. A deaf serving-woman and the light porter completed Mrs. Sparsit's empire.
<p/>The deaf serving-woman was rumoured to be wealthy; and a saying had for years gone about among the lower orders of Coketown, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) would be murdered some night when the Bank was shut, for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) money.
<p/>It was generally considered, indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had been due some time, and ought to have fallen long ago; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) life, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) situation, with an ill-conditioned tenacity that occasioned much offence and disappointment.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit's tea was just set for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) on a pert little table, with its tripod of legs in an attitude, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) insinuated after office-hours, into the company of the stern, leathern-topped, long board-table that bestrode the middle of the room.
<p/>The light porter placed the tea-tray on it, knuckling his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) forehead as a form of homage. <div class="bookquote">` Thank you, Bitzer,'  (<font color='red'><b>The porter</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) was a very light porter indeed; as light as in the days when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) blinkingly defined a horse, for girl number twenty. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thank you, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div>returned the light porter. All is shut up, Bitzer?' said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` All is shut up, ma'am.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And what,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, pouring out her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) tea, <div class="bookquote">`is the news of the day? Anything?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, ma'am, I can't say that I have heard anything particular.
<p/>Our people are a bad lot, ma'am; but that is no news, unfortunately.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What are the restless wretches doing now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is much to be regretted,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) nose more Roman and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) eyebrows more Coriolanian in the strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) severity, <div class="bookquote">`that the united masters allow of any such class- combinations.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Merely going on in the old way, ma'am. Uniting, and leaguing, and engaging to stand by one another.' ` <div class="bookquote">` Yes, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Being united themselves, they ought one and all to set their faces against employing any man who is united with any other man,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I do not pretend to understand these things,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, with dignity, <div class="bookquote">`my lot having been signally cast in a widely different sphere; and Mr. Sparsit, as a Powler, being also quite out of the pale of any such dissensions.
<p/>I only know that these people must be conquered, and that it's high time it was done, once for all.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They have done that, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>returned Bitzer; <div class="bookquote">`but it rather fell through, ma'am.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>returned Bitzer, with a demonstration of great respect for Mrs. Sparsit's oracular authority. `
<p/>As this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) usual hour for having a little confidential chat with Mrs. Sparsit, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) had already caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) eye and seen that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was going to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) made a pretence of arranging the rulers, inkstands, and so forth, while that lady went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tea, glancing through the open window, down into the street. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You couldn't put it clearer, I am sure, ma'am.'  (<font color='red'><b>that lady</b></font>)</div>Has it been a busy day, Bitzer?' asked Mrs. Sparsit. ` Not a very busy day, my lady.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) now and then slided into my lady, instead of ma'am, as an involuntary acknowledgment of Mrs. Sparsit's personal dignity and claims to reverence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The clerks,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, carefully brushing an imperceptible crumb of bread and butter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) left-hand mitten, <div class="bookquote">`are trustworthy, punctual, and industrious, of course?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) held the respectable office of general spy and informer in the establishment, for which volunteer service he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) received a present at Christmas, over and above his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) weekly wage.
<p/>About an average day.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>Yes, ma'am, pretty fair, ma'am. With the usual exception.' He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) had grown into an extremely clear-headed, cautious, prudent young man, who was safe to rise in the world.
<p/>All his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proceedings were the result of the nicest and coldest calculation; and it was not without cause that Mrs. Sparsit habitually observed of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a young man of the steadiest principle she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had ever known.
<p/>Having satisfied himself, on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's death, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother had a right of settlement in Coketown, this excellent young economist had asserted that right for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with such a steadfast adherence to the principle of the case, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been shut up in the workhouse ever since.
<p/>It must be admitted that he (<font color='blue'><b>economist</b></font>) allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) half a pound of tea a year, which was weak in him (<font color='blue'><b>economist</b></font>): first, because all gifts have an inevitable tendency to pauperise the recipient, and secondly, because his (<font color='blue'><b>economist</b></font>) only reasonable transaction in that commodity would have been to buy it for as little as he (<font color='blue'><b>economist</b></font>) could possibly give, and sell it for as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>economist</b></font>) could possibly get; it having been clearly ascertained by philosophers that in this is comprised the whole duty of man - not a part of man's duty, but the whole. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind was so exactly regulated, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no affections or passions. Pretty fair, ma'am. With the usual exception, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>repeated Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah - h!'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) tea-cup, and taking a long gulp. <div class="bookquote">` Mr. Thomas, ma'am, I doubt Mr. Thomas very much, ma'am, I don't like his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) ways at all.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bitzer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, in a very impressive manner, <div class="bookquote">`do you recollect my having said anything to you respecting names?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's quite true that you did object to names being used, and they're always best avoided.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Please to remember that I have a charge here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) air of state.
<p/>However improbable both Mr. Bounderby and myself might have deemed it years ago, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would ever become my patron, making me an annual compliment, I cannot but regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) in that light.
<p/>From Mr. Bounderby I have received every acknowledgment of my social station, and every recognition of my family descent, that I could possibly expect.
<p/>I beg your pardon, ma'am. <div class="bookquote">` I hold a trust here, Bitzer, under Mr. Bounderby. More, far more. Therefore, to my patron I will be scrupulously true.
<p/>And I do not consider, I will not consider, I cannot consider,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, with a most extensive stock on hand of honour and morality, <div class="bookquote">`that I should be scrupulously true, if I allowed names to be mentioned under this roof, that are unfortunately - most unfortunately - no doubt of that - connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>).'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Bitzer knuckled his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) forehead again, and again begged pardon. <div class="bookquote">` No, Bitzer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Sparsit , <div class="bookquote">`say an individual, and I will hear you; say Mr. Thomas, and you must excuse me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sparsit repeated the ejaculation, the shake of the head over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) tea-cup, and the long gulp, as taking up the conversation again at the point where it had been interrupted. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>An individual, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, `has never been what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) ought to have been, since he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) first came into the place.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`With the usual exception, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, trying back, <div class="bookquote">`of an individual.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ah - h!'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) is a dissipated, extravagant idler.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) is not worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) salt, ma'am. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) wouldn't get it either, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) hadn't a friend and relation at court, ma'am!'
<p/>I only hope, ma'am,' pursued Bitzer, `that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) friend and relation may not supply him (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) with the means of carrying on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Ah - h!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, with another melancholy shake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` Otherwise, ma'am, we know out of whose pocket that money comes.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Ah - h!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>sighed Mrs. Sparsit again, with another melancholy shake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) is to be pitied, ma'am.
<p/>The last party I have alluded to, is to be pitied, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, Bitzer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>As to an individual, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) voice and drawing nearer, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) is as improvident as any of the people in this town.
<p/>I have always pitied the delusion, always.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And you know what their improvidence is, ma'am. No one could wish to know it better than a lady of your eminence does.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` They would do well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`to take example by you, Bitzer.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Thank you, ma'am. But, since you do refer to me, now look at me, ma'am.
<p/>I have put by a little, ma'am, already. That gratuity which I receive at Christmas, ma'am: I never touch it. I don't even go the length of my wages, though they're not high, ma'am.
<p/>Why can't they do as I have done, ma'am? What one person can do, another can do.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This, again, was among the fictions of Coketown.
<p/>Any capitalist there, who had made sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, always professed to wonder why the sixty thousand nearest Hands didn't each make sixty thousand pounds out of sixpence, and more or less reproached them every one for not accomplishing the little feat.
<p/>What I did you can do. Why don't you go and do it? <div class="bookquote">` As to their wanting recreations, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, <div class="bookquote">`it's stuff and nonsense.
<p/>As to their combining together; there are many of them, I have no doubt, that by watching and informing upon one another could earn a trifle now and then, whether in money or good will, and improve their livelihood.
<p/>I don't want recreations. I never did, and I never shall ; I don't like 'em. Then, why don't they improve it, ma'am!
<p/>It's the first consideration of a rational creature, and it's what they pretend to want.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Pretend indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am sure we are constantly hearing, ma'am, till it becomes quite nauseous, concerning their wives and families,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why look at me, ma'am! I don't want a wife and family. Why should they?'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Because they are improvident,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Bitzer, <div class="bookquote">`that's where it is. If they were more provident and less perverse, ma'am, what would they do?
<p/>They would say, ``While my hat covers my family,'' or ``while my bonnet covers my family,'' - as the case might be, ma'am - ``I have only one to feed, and that's the person I most like to feed.'''  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`To be sure,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>assented Mrs. Sparsit, eating muffin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thank you, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, knuckling his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) forehead again, in return for the favour of Mrs. Sparsit's improving conversation. <div class="bookquote">` Would you wish a little more hot water, ma'am, or is there anything else that I could fetch you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I shouldn't wish to disturb you at your meals, ma'am, particularly tea, knowing your partiality for it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, craning a little to look over into the street from where he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) stood; <div class="bookquote">`but there's a gentleman been looking up here for a minute or so, ma'am, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) has come across as if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was going to knock.
<p/>Nothing just now, Bitzer.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Thank you, ma'am. That is his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) knock, ma'am, no doubt.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) stepped to the window; and looking out, and drawing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) head again, confirmed himself with, <div class="bookquote">`Yes, ma'am.
<p/>Would you wish the gentleman to be shown in, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I don't know who it can be,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mouth and arranging her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mittens. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A stranger, ma'am, evidently.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What a stranger can want at the Bank at this time of the evening, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) comes upon some business for which he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) is too late, I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, `
<p/>but I hold a charge in this establishment from Mr. Bounderby, and I will never shrink from it. If to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) is any part of the duty I have accepted, I will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>).
<p/>Here the visitor, all unconscious of Mrs. Sparsit's magnanimous words, repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) knock so loudly that the light porter hastened down to open the door; while Mrs. Sparsit took the precaution of concealing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) little table, with all its appliances upon it, in a cupboard, and then decamped up-stairs, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) might appear, if needful, with the greater dignity. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If you please, ma'am, the gentleman would wish to see you,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) light eye at Mrs. Sparsit's keyhole.
<p/>So, Mrs. Sparsit, who had improved the interval by touching up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) cap, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) classical features down-stairs again, and entered the board- room in the manner of a Roman matron going outside the city walls to treat with an invading general.
<p/>The visitor having strolled to the window, and being then engaged in looking carelessly out, was as unmoved by this impressive entry as man could possibly be.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood whistling to himself with all imaginable coolness, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hat still on, and a certain air of exhaustion upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in part arising from excessive summer, and in part from excessive gentility.
<p/>For it was to be seen with half an eye that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a thorough gentleman, made to the model of the time; weary of everything, and putting no more faith in anything than Lucifer. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Use your own discretion, Bitzer.'  (<font color='red'><b>Lucifer</b></font>)</div>I believe, sir,' quoth Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`you wished to see me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I beg your pardon,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) said, turning and removing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) hat; <div class="bookquote">`pray excuse me.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Humph!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought Mrs. Sparsit, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) made a stately bend. <div class="bookquote">` Five and thirty, good-looking, good figure, good teeth, good voice, good breeding, well-dressed, dark hair, bold eyes.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>All which Mrs. Sparsit observed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) womanly way - like the Sultan who put his (<font color='blue'><b>Sultan</b></font>) head in the pail of water - merely in dipping down and coming up again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Please to be seated, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Sultan</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` Thank you. Allow me.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Sultan</b></font>) placed a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), but remained himself carelessly lounging against the table. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I left my servant at the railway looking after the luggage - very heavy train and vast quantity of it in the van - and strolled on, looking about me.
<p/>Will you allow me to ask you if it's always as black as this?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`In general much blacker,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) uncompromising way. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>It was once my good or ill fortune, as it may be - before I became a widow - to move in a very different sphere.

<p/>I am the servant of circumstances, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>The stranger</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`and I have long adapted myself to the governing power of my life.'

<p/>May I be permitted to ask, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, `to what I am indebted for the favour of - ` <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>Much obliged to you for reminding me. I am the bearer of a letter of introduction to Mr. Bounderby, the banker.
<p/>Walking through this extraordinarily black town, while they were getting dinner ready at the hotel, I asked a fellow whom I met; one of the working people; who appeared to have been taking a shower-bath of something fluffy, which I assume to be the raw material - ` Mrs. Sparsit inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>- Raw material - where Mr. Bounderby, the banker, might reside. Upon which, misled no doubt by the word Banker, he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) directed me to the Bank.
<p/>Fact being, I presume, that Mr. Bounderby the Banker does not reside in the edifice in which I have the honour of offering this explanation?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) does not.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Thank you. I had no intention of delivering my letter at the present moment, nor have
<p/>I. But strolling on to the Bank to kill time, and having the good fortune to observe at the window,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>towards which he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) languidly waved his (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) hand, then slightly bowed, `a lady of a very superior and agreeable appearance, I considered that I could not do better than take the liberty of asking that lady where Mr. Bounderby the Banker does live.
<p/>The inattention and indolence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) manner were sufficiently relieved, to Mrs. Sparsit's thinking, by a certain gallantry at ease, which offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) homage too.
<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) was, for instance, at this moment, all but sitting on the table, and yet lazily bending over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) acknowledged an attraction in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) that made her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) charming - in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) way. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Banks, I know, are always suspicious, and officially must be,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said the stranger, whose lightness and smoothness of speech were pleasant likewise; suggesting matter far more sensible and humorous than it ever contained - which was perhaps a shrewd device of the founder of this numerous sect, whosoever may have been that great man: <div class="bookquote">`therefore I may observe that my letter - here it is - is from the member for this place - Gradgrind - whom I have had the pleasure of knowing in London.'
 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sparsit recognized the hand, intimated that such confirmation was quite unnecessary, and gave Mr. Bounderby's address, with all needful clues and directions in aid. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Which I accordingly venture, with all suitable apologies, to do.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>Thousand thanks,' said the stranger. <div class="bookquote">` Of course you know the Banker
<p/>well?'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` In my dependent relation towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>), I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) ten years.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Quite an eternity! I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) married Gradgrind's daughter?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, suddenly compressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mouth, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Banker</b></font>) had that - honour.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Excuse my impertinent curiosity,' pursued the stranger, fluttering over Mrs. Sparsit's eyebrows, with a propitiatory air, `but you know the family, and know the world.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` The lady is quite a philosopher, I am told?'  (<font color='red'><b>the family</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I am about to know the family, and may have much to do with them.
<p/>Is the lady so very alarming? Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) father gives her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) such a portentously hard-headed reputation, that I have a burning desire to know.
<p/>Is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) absolutely unapproachable? Repellently and stunningly clever? I see, by your meaning smile, you think not. You have poured balm into my anxious soul.
<p/>Not twenty when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was married.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I give you my honour, Mrs. Powler,'  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>returned the stranger, detaching himself from the table, <div class="bookquote">`that I never was so astonished in my life!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div><p/>As to age, now. Forty? Five and thirty?' Mrs. Sparsit laughed outright. <div class="bookquote">` A chit,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>). ` It really did seem to impress him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>), to the utmost extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) capacity of being impressed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) informant for full a quarter of a minute, and appeared to have the surprise in his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) mind all the time. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I assure you, Mrs. Powler,'  (<font color='red'><b>informant</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) then said, much exhausted, <div class="bookquote">`that the father's manner prepared me for a grim and stony maturity.
<p/>I am obliged to you, of all things, for correcting so absurd a mistake. Pray excuse my intrusion. Many thanks. Good day!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) bowed himself out; and Mrs. Sparsit, hiding in the window curtain, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) languishing down the street on the shady side of the way, observed of all the town. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What do you think of the gentleman, Bitzer?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) asked the light porter, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) came to take away. <div class="bookquote">` Spends a deal of money on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) dress, ma'am.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`It must be admitted,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`that it's very tasteful.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Yes, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Bitzer, <div class="bookquote">`if that's worth the money.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Besides which, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>resumed Bitzer, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) was polishing the table, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) looks to me as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) gamed.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>Whether it was that the heat prevented Mrs. Sparsit from working, or whether it was that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) hand was out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) did no work that night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) sat at the window, when the sun began to sink behind the smoke; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) sat there, when the smoke was burning red, when the colour faded from it, when darkness seemed to rise slowly out of the ground, and creep upward, upward, up to the house-tops, up the church steeple, up to the summits of the factory chimneys, up to the sky.
<p/>Without a candle in the room, Mrs. Sparsit sat at the window, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) hands before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), not thinking much of the sounds of evening;
<p/>the whooping of boys, the barking of dogs, the rumbling of wheels, the steps and voices of passengers, the shrill street cries, the clogs upon the pavement when it was their hour for going by, the shutting-up of shop-shutters.
<p/>Not until the light porter announced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) nocturnal sweetbread was ready, did Mrs. Sparsit arouse herself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) reverie, and convey her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) dense black eyebrows - by that time creased with meditation, as if they needed ironing out-up-stairs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's immoral to game,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` It's ridiculous, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, <div class="bookquote">`because the chances are against the players.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>O, you Fool!' said Mrs. Sparsit, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was alone at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) supper.
<p/>Whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) meant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) did not say; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) could scarcely have meant the sweetbread. CHAPTER II - MR. JAMES HARTHOUSE THE Gradgrind party wanted assistance in cutting the throats of the Graces.
<p/>They went about recruiting; and where could they enlist recruits more hopefully, than among the fine gentlemen who, having found out everything to be worth nothing, were equally ready for anything?
<p/>Moreover, the healthy spirits who had mounted to this sublime height were attractive to many of the Gradgrind school. They liked fine gentlemen; they pretended that they did not, but they did.
<p/>They became exhausted in imitation of them; and they yaw-yawed in their speech like them; and they served out, with an enervated air, the little mouldy rations of political economy, on which they regaled their disciples.
<p/>Among the fine gentlemen not regularly belonging to the Gradgrind school, there was one of a good family and a better appearance, with a happy turn of humour which had told immensely with the House of Commons on the occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) entertaining it with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) -LRB-and the Board of Directors-RRB- view of a railway accident, in which the most careful officers ever known, employed by the most liberal managers ever heard of, assisted by the finest mechanical contrivances ever devised, the whole in action on the best line ever constructed, had killed five people and wounded thirty-two, by a casualty without which the excellence of the whole system would have been positively incomplete.
<p/>There never before was seen on earth such a wonderful hybrid race as was thus produced. Among the slain was a cow, and among the scattered articles unowned, a widow's cap.
<p/>And the honourable member had so tickled the House -LRB-which has a delicate sense of humour-RRB- by putting the cap on the cow, that it became impatient of any serious reference to the Coroner's Inquest, and brought the railway off with Cheers and Laughter.
<p/>Now, this gentleman had a younger brother of still better appearance than himself, who had tried life as a Cornet of Dragoons, and found it a bore; and had afterwards tried it in the train of an English minister abroad, and found it a bore; and had then strolled to Jerusalem, and got bored there; and had then gone yachting about the world, and got bored everywhere.
<p/>To whom this honourable and jocular, member fraternally said one day, `Jem, there's a good opening among the hard Fact fellows, and they want men.
<p/>Jem, rather taken by the novelty of the idea, and very hard up for a change, was as ready to <div class="bookquote">`go in'  (<font color='red'><b>Jem/JEM</b></font>)</div>for statistics as for anything else.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) coached himself up with a blue-book or two; and his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) brother put it about among the hard Fact fellows, and said, <div class="bookquote">`If you want to bring in, for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech, look after my brother Jem, for he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)'s your man.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Fact fellows</b></font>)</div><p/>After a few dashes in the public meeting way, Mr. Gradgrind and a council of political sages approved of Jem, and it was resolved to send him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) down to Coketown, to become known there and in the neighbourhood.
<p/>Hence the letter Jem had last night shown to Mrs. Sparsit, which Mr. Bounderby now held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hand; superscribed, `Josiah Bounderby, Esquire, Banker, Coketown.
<p/>Within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and Mr. James Harthouse's card, Mr. Bounderby put on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hat and went down to the Hotel.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) found Mr. James Harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so disconsolate, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) was already half- disposed to <div class="bookquote">`go in'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>for something else. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I wonder you don't go in for statistics.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>So, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) went in. Specially to introduce James Harthouse, Esquire. Thomas Gradgrind.' My name, sir,' said his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) visitor, <div class="bookquote">`is Josiah Bounderby, of Coketown.'
 (<font color='red'><b>visitor</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. James Harthouse was very happy indeed -LRB-though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) scarcely looked so-RRB- to have a pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had long expected. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Therefore, if you will allow me - or whether you will or not, for I am a plain man - I'll tell you something about it before we go any further.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Coketown, sir,' said Bounderby, obstinately taking a chair, `is not the kind of place you have been accustomed to. Mr. Harthouse would be charmed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't be too sure of that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` I don't promise it. First of all, you see our smoke. That's meat and drink to us.
<p/>It's the healthiest thing in the world in all respects, and particularly for the lungs. If you are one of those who want us to consume it, I differ from you.
<p/>We are not going to wear the bottoms of our boilers out any faster than we wear 'em out now, for all the humbugging sentiment in Great Britain and Ireland.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>By way of <div class="bookquote">`going in'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>to the fullest extent, Mr. Harthouse rejoined, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Bounderby, I assure you I am entirely and completely of your way of thinking.
<p/>On conviction.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I am glad to hear it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` Now, you have heard a lot of talk about the work in our mills, no doubt.
<p/>It's the pleasantest work there is, and it's the lightest work there is, and it's the best- paid work there is.
<p/>You have? Very good. I'll state the fact of it to you. More than that, we couldn't improve the mills themselves, unless we laid down Turkey carpets on the floors.
<p/>Which we're not a-going to do.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Mr. Bounderby, perfectly right.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Lastly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`as to our Hands. There's not a Hand in this town, sir, man, woman, or child, but has one ultimate object in life.
<p/>Now, they're not a-going - none of 'em - ever to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon.
<p/>That object is, to be fed on turtle soup and venison with a gold spoon. And now you know the place.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Harthouse professed himself in the highest degree instructed and refreshed, by this condensed epitome of the whole Coketown question. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, you see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`it suits my disposition to have a full understanding with a man, particularly with a public man, when I make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquaintance.
<p/>I have only one thing more to say to you, Mr. Harthouse, before assuring you of the pleasure with which I shall respond, to the utmost of my poor ability, to my friend Tom Gradgrind's letter of introduction.
<p/>You are a man of family. Don't you deceive yourself by supposing for a moment that I am a man of family.
<p/>I am a bit of dirty riff-raff, and a genuine scrap of tag, rag, and bobtail.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>If anything could have exalted Jem's interest in Mr. Bounderby, it would have been this very circumstance.
<p/>I say, equal terms, because although I know what I am, and the exact depth of the gutter I have lifted myself out of, better than any man does, I am as proud as you are.
<p/>Or, so he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` So now,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`we may shake hands on equal terms. I am just as proud as you are.
<p/>Having now asserted my independence in a proper manner, I may come to how do you find yourself, and I hope you're pretty well.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>The better, Mr. Harthouse gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) to understand as they shook hands, for the salubrious air of Coketown. Mr. Bounderby received the answer with favour. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If you have nothing better to do than to walk up town with me, I shall be glad to introduce you to Tom Gradgrind's daughter.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Perhaps you know,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`or perhaps you don't know , I married Tom Gradgrind's daughter. Mr. Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Jem, <div class="bookquote">`you anticipate my dearest wishes.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Jem/JEM</b></font>)</div><p/>They went out without further discourse; and Mr. Bounderby piloted the new acquaintance who so strongly contrasted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), to the private red brick dwelling, with the black outside shutters, the green inside blinds, and the black street door up the two white steps.
<p/>In the drawing-room of which mansion, there presently entered to them the most remarkable girl Mr. James Harthouse had ever seen.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so constrained, and yet so careless; so reserved, and yet so watchful; so cold and proud, and yet so sensitively ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband's braggart humility - from which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shrunk as if every example of it were a cut or a blow; that it was quite a new sensation to observe her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) features were handsome; but their natural play was so locked up, that it seemed impossible to guess at their genuine expression.
<p/>Utterly indifferent, perfectly self- reliant, never at a loss, and yet never at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ease, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) figure in company with them there, and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind apparently quite alone - it was of no use <div class="bookquote">`going in'  (<font color='red'><b>this girl</b></font>)</div>yet awhile to comprehend this girl, for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) baffled all penetration.
<p/>In face she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was no less remarkable than in manner. From the mistress of the house, the visitor glanced to the house itself.
<p/>There was no mute sign of a woman in the room. No graceful little adornment, no fanciful little device, however trivial, anywhere expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) influence.
<p/>Cheerless and comfortless, boastfully and doggedly rich, there the room stared at its present occupants, unsoftened and unrelieved by the least trace of any womanly occupation.
<p/>As Mr. Bounderby stood in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) household gods, so those unrelenting divinities occupied their places around Mr. Bounderby, and they were worthy of one another, and well matched. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`is my wife, Mrs. Bounderby: Tom Gradgrind's eldest daughter. Loo, Mr. James Harthouse. Mr. Harthouse has joined your father's muster-roll.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) is not Tom Gradgrind's colleague before long, I believe we shall at least hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) in connexion with one of our neighbouring towns.
<p/>I don't know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) saw in me to marry me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) saw something in me, I suppose, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) wouldn't have married me.
<p/>If you want to cram for anything, I should be troubled to recommend you to a better adviser than Loo Bounderby.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>To a more agreeable adviser, or one from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would be more likely to learn, Mr. Harthouse could never be recommended. <div class="bookquote">`Come!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) host. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You observe, Mr. Harthouse, that my wife is my junior. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has lots of expensive knowledge, sir, political and otherwise. If you're in the complimentary line, you'll get on here, for you'll meet with no competition.
<p/>I have never been in the way of learning compliments myself, and I don't profess to understand the art of paying 'em.
<p/>In fact, despise 'em. But, your bringing-up was different from mine; mine was a real thing, by George! You're a gentleman, and I don't pretend to be one.
<p/>I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, and that's enough for me. However, though I am not influenced by manners and station, Loo Bounderby may be.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>'em</b></font>) hadn't my advantages - disadvantages you would call 'em, but I call 'em advantages - so you'll not waste your power, I dare say.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>Jem/JEM</b></font>)</div>said Jem, turning with a smile to Louisa, <div class="bookquote">`is a noble animal in a comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in which a conventional hack like myself works.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was disgracefully thrown out, for a gentleman who had seen so much of the world, and thought, <div class="bookquote">`Now, how am I to take this?'  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are going to devote yourself, as I gather from what Mr. Bounderby has said, to the service of your country.
<p/>You have made up your mind,'  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, still standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had first stopped - in all the singular contrariety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) self- possession, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) being obviously very ill at ease - <div class="bookquote">`to show the nation the way out of all its difficulties.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` You respect Mr. Bounderby very much,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) quietly returned. <div class="bookquote">` It is natural that you should.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Mrs. Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) returned, laughing, <div class="bookquote">`upon my honour, no.
<p/>I have seen a little, here and there, up and down; I have found it all to be very worthless, as everybody has, and as some confess they have, and some do not; and I am going in for your respected father's opinions - really because I have no choice of opinions, and may as well back them as anything else.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I will make no such pretence to you. <div class="bookquote">`Have you none of your own?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>asked Louisa. ` I have not so much as the slightest predilection left.
<p/>The result of the varieties of boredom I have undergone, is a conviction -LRB-unless conviction is too industrious a word for the lazy sentiment I entertain on the subject-RRB-, that any set of ideas will do just as much good as any other set, and just as much harm as any other set.
<p/>I assure you I attach not the least importance to any opinions. There's an English family with a charming Italian motto.
<p/>This vicious assumption of honesty in dishonesty - a vice so dangerous, so deadly, and so common - seemed, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) observed, a little to impress her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) favour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) followed up the advantage, by saying in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pleasantest manner: a manner to which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might attach as much or as little meaning as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pleased: <div class="bookquote">`The side that can prove anything in a line of units, tens, hundreds, and thousands, Mrs. Bounderby, seems to me to afford the most fun, and to give a man the best chance.
<p/>What will be, will be. It's the only truth going!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I am quite as much attached to it as if I believed it.
<p/>I am quite ready to go in for it, to the same extent as if I believed it. And what more could I possibly do, if I did believe it!' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We are the largest party in the state, I assure you, Mrs. Bounderby, if we all fell out of our adopted ranks and were reviewed together.'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bounderby, who had been in danger of bursting in silence, interposed here with a project for postponing the family dinner till half-past six, and taking Mr. James Harthouse in the meantime on a round of visits to the voting and interesting notabilities of Coketown and its vicinity.
<p/>The round of visits was made; and Mr. James Harthouse, with a discreet use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) blue coaching, came off triumphantly, though with a considerable accession of boredom.
<p/>You are a singular politician,' said Louisa. ` Pardon me; I have not even that merit. In the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>politician</b></font>) found the dinner-table laid for four, but they sat down only three.
<p/>It was an appropriate occasion for Mr. Bounderby to discuss the flavour of the hap`orth of stewed eels he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had purchased in the streets at eight years old; and also of the inferior water, specially used for laying the dust, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had washed down that repast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) likewise entertained his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) guest over the soup and fish, with the calculation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) -LRB-Bounderby-RRB- had eaten in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) youth at least three horses under the guise of polonies and saveloys.
<p/>every now and then; and they probably would have decided him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) to <div class="bookquote">`go in'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>for Jerusalem again to-morrow morning, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) been less curious respecting Louisa. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Is there nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) thought, glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sat at the head of the table, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) youthful figure, small and slight, but very graceful, looked as pretty as it looked misplaced; <div class="bookquote">`is there nothing that will move that face?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>These recitals, Jem, in a languid manner, received with <div class="bookquote">`charming!'  (<font color='red'><b>Jem/JEM</b></font>)</div>Yes! By Jupiter, there was something, and here it was, in an unexpected shape.
<p/>Mr. James Harthouse might not have thought so much of it, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had wondered so long at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) impassive face.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) put out her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hand - a pretty little soft hand; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) fingers closed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brother's, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) would have carried them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tom appeared. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) changed as the door opened, and broke into a beaming smile. A beautiful smile. Ay, ay?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought the visitor. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This whelp is the only creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) cares for. So, so!'  (<font color='red'><b>the visitor</b></font>)</div>The whelp was presented, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) chair. The appellation was not flattering, but not unmerited. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When I was your age, young Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`I was punctual, or I got no dinner!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bounderby,' said Harthouse, perfectly hearing this under- strain as it went on; `your brother's face is quite familiar to me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Never mind that now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

(<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Can I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) abroad?
<p/>Or at some public school, perhaps?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) resumed, quite interested, `he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) has never been abroad yet, and was educated here, at home.
<p/>There was little enough in him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) to brighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) face, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was a sullen young fellow, and ungracious in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) manner even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>).
<p/>So much the greater must have been the solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) heart, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) need of some one on whom to bestow it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So much the more is this whelp the only creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) has ever cared for,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. James Harthouse, turning it over and over. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tom, love, I am telling Mr. Harthouse that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) never saw you abroad.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No such luck, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom. So much the more.
<p/>Both in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister's presence, and after she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had left the room, the whelp took no pains to hide his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) contempt for Mr. Bounderby, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) could indulge it without the observation of that independent man, by making wry faces, or shutting one eye.
<p/>Without responding to these telegraphic communications, Mr. Harthouse encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) much in the course of the evening, and showed an unusual liking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>).
<p/>At last, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) rose to return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) hotel, and was a little doubtful whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) knew the way by night, the whelp immediately proffered his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) services as guide, and turned out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) to escort him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) thither.
<p/>- THE WHELP IT was very remarkable that a young gentleman who had been brought up under one continuous system of unnatural restraint, should be a hypocrite; but it was certainly the case with Tom.
<p/>It was very strange that a young gentleman who had never been left to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own guidance for five consecutive minutes, should be incapable at last of governing himself; but so it was with Tom.
<p/>It was altogether unaccountable that a young gentleman whose imagination had been strangled in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cradle, should be still inconvenienced by its ghost in the form of grovelling sensualities; but such a monster, beyond all doubt, was Tom. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>So much the more.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER III Do you smoke?' asked Mr. James Harthouse, when they came to the hotel. <div class="bookquote">` I believe you!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said Tom.
<p/>What with a cooling drink adapted to the weather, but not so weak as cool; and what with a rarer tobacco than was to be bought in those parts; Tom was soon in a highly free and easy state at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) end of the sofa, and more than ever disposed to admire his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new friend at the other end.
<p/>Tom blew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) smoke aside, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had been smoking a little while, and took an observation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could do no less than ask Tom up; and Tom could do no less than go up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) don't seem to care about his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) dress,'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>thought Tom, `and yet how capitally he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) does it.
<p/>Mr. James Harthouse, happening to catch Tom's eye, remarked that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) drank nothing, and filled his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) glass with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own negligent hand. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What an easy swell he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Thank`ee,' said Tom. <div class="bookquote">` Thank`ee. Well, Mr. Harthouse, I hope you have had about a dose of old Bounderby to-night.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Tom said this with one eye shut up again, and looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) glass knowingly, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) entertainer. <div class="bookquote">` A very good fellow indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>entertainer</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. James Harthouse. `
<p/>Mr. James Harthouse smiled; and rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) end of the sofa, and lounging with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) back against the chimney-piece, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) stood before the empty fire-grate as he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) smoked, in front of Tom and looking down at him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), observed: <div class="bookquote">`What a comical brother-in-law you are!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What a comical brother-in-law old Bounderby is,
<p/>You think so, don't you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom. And shut up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) eye again. I think you mean,' said Tom. <div class="bookquote">` You are a piece of caustic, Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. James Harthouse.
<p/>There was something so very agreeable in being so intimate with such a waistcoat; in being called Tom, in such an intimate way, by such a voice; in being on such off-hand terms so soon, with such a pair of whiskers; that Tom was uncommonly pleased with himself. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have always called old Bounderby by the same name when I have talked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), and I have always thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the same way.
<p/>Oh! I don't care for old Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`if you mean that. I am not going to begin to be polite now, about old Bounderby.
<p/>It would be rather late in the day.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Don't mind me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>returned James; <div class="bookquote">`but take care when his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) wife is by, you know.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) wife?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">` My sister Loo ? O yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) laughed, and took a little more of the cooling drink.
<p/>James Harthouse continued to lounge in the same place and attitude, smoking his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) cigar in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) own easy way, and looking pleasantly at the whelp, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) knew himself to be a kind of agreeable demon who had only to hover over him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) must give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) whole soul if required.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) companion sneakingly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) admiringly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) boldly, and put up one leg on the sofa. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It certainly did seem that the whelp yielded to this influence. My sister Loo?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) never cared for old Bounderby.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` That's the past tense, Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. James Harthouse, striking the ash from his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) cigar with his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) little finger. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>First person singular, I do not care; second person singular, thou dost not care; third person singular, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) does not care,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>returned Tom. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We are in the present tense, now.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Verb neuter, not to care. Indicative mood, present tense. Good!

<p/>Though you don't mean it.'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But I do mean it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>cried Tom. <div class="bookquote">` Upon my honour!

<p/>My dear fellow,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned the other, <div class="bookquote">`what am I bound to suppose, when I find two married people living in harmony and happiness?'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) second leg had not been already there when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was called a dear fellow, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would have put it up at that great stage of the conversation.
<p/>Feeling it necessary to do something then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) stretched himself out at greater length, and, reclining with the back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) head on the end of the sofa, and smoking with an infinite assumption of negligence, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) common face, and not too sober eyes, towards the face looking down upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) so carelessly yet so potently. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tom had by this time got both his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) legs on the sofa. You know our governor, Mr. Harthouse,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">`and therefore, you needn't be surprised that Loo married old Bounderby.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) never had a lover, and the governor proposed old Bounderby, and she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Very dutiful in your interesting sister,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. James Harthouse. <div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>the whelp</b></font>)</div><p/>The tempter merely lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) eyebrows; but the whelp was obliged to go on. <div class="bookquote">` I persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>the whelp</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) said, with an edifying air of superiority. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I was stuck into old Bounderby's bank -LRB-where I never wanted to be-RRB-, and I knew I should get into scrapes there, if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) put old Bounderby's pipe out; so I told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) my wishes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) came into them.
<p/>It was charming, Tom!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not that it was altogether so important to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as it was to me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>continued Tom coolly, <div class="bookquote">`because my liberty and comfort, and perhaps my getting on, depended on it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had no other lover, and staying at home was like staying in jail - especially when I was gone.
<p/>It wasn't as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gave up another lover for old Bounderby; but still it was a good thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would do anything for me.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Oh,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Tom, with contemptuous patronage, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s a regular girl.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can shut herself up within herself, and think - as I have often known her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sit and watch the fire - for an hour at a stretch.'

<p/>Oh no!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>These were the last words spoken by the whelp, before a giddy drowsiness came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), followed by complete oblivion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was roused from the latter state by an uneasy dream of being stirred up with a boot, and also of a voice saying: <div class="bookquote">`Come, it's late.
<p/>Be off!'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) said, scrambling from the sofa. <div class="bookquote">` I must take my leave of you though. I say.
<p/>Yours is very good tobacco. But it's too mild.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, it's too mild,'  (<font color='red'><b>entertainer</b></font>)</div>returned his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) entertainer. <div class="bookquote">` It's - it's ridiculously mild,'  (<font color='red'><b>entertainer</b></font>)</div>said Tom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had another odd dream of being taken by a waiter through a mist, which, after giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) some trouble and difficulty, resolved itself into the main street, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood alone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) then walked home pretty easily, though not yet free from an impression of the presence and influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) new friend - as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) were lounging somewhere in the air, in the same negligent attitude, regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with the same look.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had had any sense of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had done that night, and had been less of a whelp and more of a brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have turned short on the road, might have gone down to the ill-smelling river that was dyed black, might have gone to bed in it for good and all, and have curtained his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head for ever with its filthy waters.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Where's the door! Good night!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The whelp went home, and went to bed. CHAPTER IV - MEN AND BROTHERS <div class="bookquote">`OH, my friends, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown!
<p/>Oh, my friends and fellow-countrymen, the slaves of an iron-handed and a grinding despotism! Oh, my friends and fellow-sufferers, and fellow-workmen, and fellow-men!
<p/>I tell you that the hour is come, when we must rally round one another as One united power, and crumble into dust the oppressors that too long have battened upon the plunder of our families, upon the sweat of our brows, upon the labour of our hands, upon the strength of our sinews, upon the God- created glorious rights of Humanity, and upon the holy and eternal privileges of Brotherhood!'  (<font color='red'><b>MEN OH</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>and other cries, arose in many voices from various parts of the densely crowded and suffocatingly close Hall, in which the orator, perched on a stage, delivered himself of this and what other froth and fume he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) had in him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>).
<p/>Good!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Hear, hear, hear!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Hurrah!'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) had declaimed himself into a violent heat, and was as hoarse as he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was hot.
<p/>By dint of roaring at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) voice under a flaring gaslight, clenching his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) fists, knitting his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) brows, setting his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) teeth, and pounding with his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) had taken so much out of himself by this time, that he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was brought to a stop, and called for a glass of water.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) stood there, trying to quench his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) fiery face with his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) drink of water, the comparison between the orator and the crowd of attentive faces turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>), was extremely to his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) disadvantage.
<p/>Judging him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) by Nature's evidence, he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was above the mass in very little but the stage on which he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) stood. In many great respects he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was essentially below them.
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was not so manly, he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) was not so good-humoured; he (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) substituted cunning for their simplicity, and passion for their safe solid sense.
<p/>An ill-made, high-shouldered man, with lowering brows, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features crushed into an habitually sour expression, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contrasted most unfavourably, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mongrel dress, with the great body of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hearers in their plain working clothes.
<p/>Strange as it always is to consider any assembly in the act of submissively resigning itself to the dreariness of some complacent person, lord or commoner, whom three-fourths of it could, by no human means, raise out of the slough of inanity to their own intellectual level, it was particularly strange, and it was even particularly affecting, to see this crowd of earnest faces, whose honesty in the main no competent observer free from bias could doubt, so agitated by such a leader.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) was not so honest Good! Hear, hear! Hurrah! The eagerness both of attention and intention, exhibited in all the countenances, made them a most impressive sight.
<p/>There was no carelessness, no languor, no idle curiosity; none of the many shades of indifference to be seen in all other assemblies, visible for one moment there.
<p/>That every man felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) condition to be, somehow or other, worse than it might be; that every man considered it incumbent on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to join the rest, towards the making of it better; that every man felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only hope to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) allying himself to the comrades by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was surrounded; and that in this belief, right or wrong -LRB-unhappily wrong then-RRB-, the whole of that crowd were gravely, deeply, faithfully in earnest; must have been as plain to any one who chose to see what was there, as the bare beams of the roof and the whitened brick walls.
<p/>Nor could any such spectator fail to know in his (<font color='blue'><b>spectator</b></font>) own breast, that these men, through their very delusions, showed great qualities, susceptible of being turned to the happiest and best account; and that to pretend -LRB-on the strength of sweeping axioms, howsoever cut and dried-RRB- that they went astray wholly without cause, and of their own irrational wills, was to pretend that there could be smoke without fire, death without birth, harvest without seed, anything or everything produced from nothing.
<p/>The orator having refreshed himself, wiped his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) corrugated forehead from left to right several times with his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) handkerchief folded into a pad, and concentrated all his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) revived forces, in a sneer of great disdain and bitterness. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What shall we say of that man - that working-man, that I should find it necessary so to libel the glorious name - who, being practically and well acquainted with the grievances and wrongs of you, the injured pith and marrow of this land, and having heard you, with a noble and majestic unanimity that will make Tyrants tremble, resolve for to subscribe to the funds of the United Aggregate Tribunal, and to abide by the injunctions issued by that body for your benefit, whatever they may be - what
<p/>, I ask you, will you say of that working-man, since such I must acknowledge him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to be, who, at such a time, deserts his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) post, and sells his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) flag; who, at such a time, turns a traitor and a craven and a recreant, who, at such a time, is not ashamed to make to you the dastardly and humiliating avowal that he (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) will hold himself aloof, and will not be one of those associated in the gallant stand for Freedom and for Right?'
 (<font color='red'><b>The orator</b></font>)</div><p/>But oh, my friends and brothers! Oh, men and Englishmen, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown! The assembly was divided at this point.
<p/>There were some groans and hisses, but the general sense of honour was much too strong for the condemnation of a man unheard. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Be sure you're right, Slackbridge!'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Put him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Let's hear him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such things were said on many sides. Finally, one strong voice called out, `Is the man heer?
<p/>If the man's heer, Slackbridge, let's hear the man himseln, <div class="bookquote">`stead o'  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>yo.' Which was received with a round of applause.
<p/>Slackbridge, the orator, looked about him (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) with a withering smile; and, holding out his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) right hand at arm's length -LRB-as the manner of all Slackbridges is-RRB-, to still the thundering sea, waited until there was a profound silence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, my friends and fellow-men!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Slackbridge then, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>orator</b></font>) head with violent scorn, <div class="bookquote">`I do not wonder that you, the prostrate sons of labour, are incredulous of the existence of such a man.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who sold his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) birthright for a mess of pottage existed, and Judas Iscariot existed, and Castlereagh existed, and this man exists!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Slackbridge</b></font>)</div><p/>Here, a brief press and confusion near the stage, ended in the man himself standing at the orator's side before the concourse.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was pale and a little moved in the face - his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips especially showed it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood quiet, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left hand at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chin, waiting to be heard.
<p/>My friends,' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`by virtue o'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>my office as your president, I askes o' our friend Slackbridge, who may be a little over hetter in this business, to take his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seat, whiles this man Stephen Blackpool is heern.
<p/>There was a chairman to regulate the proceedings, and this functionary now took the case into his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) own hands. <div class="bookquote">` You all know this man Stephen Blackpool.
<p/>You know him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) awlung o'  (<font color='red'><b>a chairman</b></font>)</div>his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) misfort`ns, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good name.' With that, the chairman shook him (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) frankly by the hand, and sat down again.
<p/>Slackbridge likewise sat down, wiping his (<font color='blue'><b>chairman</b></font>) hot forehead - always from left to right, and never the reverse way. <div class="bookquote">` My friends,'  (<font color='red'><b>Slackbridge</b></font>)</div>Stephen began, in the midst of a dead calm; <div class="bookquote">`I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>hed
<p/>But I'd liefer you'd hearn the truth concernin myseln, fro my lips than fro onny other man's, though I never cud'n speak afore
<p/>what's been spok'n o' me, and 'tis lickly that I shan't mend it. so monny, wi'out bein moydert and muddled.' Slackbridge shook his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would shake it off, in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bitterness. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'm th'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>one single Hand in Bounderby's mill, o' a' the men theer, as don't coom in wi' th' proposed reg`lations.
<p/>I canna coom in wi' 'em. My friends, I doubt their doin' yo onny good. Licker they'll do yo hurt.' Slackbridge laughed, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) arms, and frowned sarcastically. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>Slackbridge</b></font>)</div>my reasons - mine, yo see - for being hindered; not on'y now, but awlus - awlus - life long!'
<p/>But <div class="bookquote">`t an't sommuch for that as I stands out. If that were aw, I'd coom in wi'  (<font color='red'><b>Slackbridge</b></font>)</div>th' rest. Slackbridge jumped up and stood beside him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), gnashing and tearing. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, my friends, what but this did I tell you? Oh, my fellow- countrymen, what warning but this did I give you?
<p/>Oh, you Englishmen, I ask you how does this subornation show in one of yourselves, who is thus consenting to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) own undoing and to yours, and to your children's and your children's children's?'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>There was some applause, and some crying of Shame upon the man; but the greater part of the audience were quiet.
<p/>They looked at Stephen's worn face, rendered more pathetic by the homely emotions it evinced; and, in the kindness of their nature, they were more sorry than indignant. ''
<p/>And how shows this recreant conduct in a man on whom unequal laws are known to have fallen heavy? Tis this Delegate's trade for t' speak,' said Stephen, <div class="bookquote">`an'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>)'s paid for <div class="bookquote">`t, an'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knows his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) work.

<p/>There was a propriety, not to say a dignity in these words, that made the hearers yet more quiet and attentive.
<p/>That's not for nobbody but me.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The same strong voice called out, <div class="bookquote">`Slackbridge, let the man be heern, and howd thee tongue!'
 (<font color='red'><b>brothers</b></font>)</div><p/>My brothers,' said Stephen, whose low voice was distinctly heard, `and my fellow-workmen - for that yo are to me, though not, as I knows on, to this delegate here -
<p/>Then the place was wonderfully still. <div class="bookquote">` I ha but a word to sen, and I could sen nommore if I was to speak till Strike o'  (<font color='red'><b>this delegate</b></font>)</div>day.
<p/>I know weel, aw what's afore me. I know weel that yo aw resolve to ha nommore ado wi' a man who is not wi' yo in this matther.
<p/>I know weel that if I was a lyin parisht i' th' road, yo'd feel it right to pass me by, as a forrenner and stranger.
<p/>What I ha getn , I mun mak th' best on.' <div class="bookquote">` Stephen Blackpool,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the chairman, rising, `think on `t agen.
<p/>Think on <div class="bookquote">`t once agen, lad, afore thou`rt shunned by aw owd friends.'  (<font color='red'><b>no man</b></font>)</div>There was an universal murmur to the same effect, though no man articulated a word.
<p/>Every eye was fixed on Stephen's face. To repent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) determination, would be to take a load from all their minds.
<p/>Not a grain of anger with them was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) heart; he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knew them, far below their surface weaknesses and misconceptions, as no one but their fellow- labourer could. `
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) looked around him (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>), and knew that it was so. I ha thowt on `t, above a bit, sir. I simply canna coom in.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) made a sort of reverence to them by holding up his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) arms, and stood for the moment in that attitude; not speaking until they slowly dropped at his (<font color='blue'><b>labourer</b></font>) sides. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Monny's the pleasant word as soom heer has spok'n wi'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>me; monny's the face I see heer, as I first seen when I were yoong and lighter heart'n than now.
<p/>I mun go th' way as lays afore me. I mun tak my leave o' aw heer.' I ha' never had no fratch afore, sin ever I were born, wi' any o' my like;
<p/>Gonnows I ha' none now that's o' my makin'. Yo'll ca' me traitor and that - yo I mean t' say,' addressing Slackbridge, <div class="bookquote">`but 'tis easier to ca'  (<font color='red'><b>Slackbridge</b></font>)</div>than mak' out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) had moved away a pace or two to come down from the platform, when he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) remembered something he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) had not said, and returned again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Haply,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) said, turning his (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) furrowed face slowly about, that he (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) might as it were individually address the whole audience, those both near and distant;
<p/>`haply, when this question has been tak'n up and discoosed, there'll be a threat to turn out if I'm let to work among yo.
<p/>I hope I shall die ere ever such a time cooms, and I shall work solitary among yo unless it cooms - truly, I mun do <div class="bookquote">`t, my friends; not to brave yo, but to live.
<p/>So let be.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I ha nobbut work to live by; and wheerever can I go, I who ha worked sin I were no heighth at aw, in Coketown heer?
<p/>I mak' no complaints o' bein turned to the wa', o' bein outcasten and overlooken fro this time forrard, but hope I shall be let to work.
<p/>Not a sound was audible in the building, but the slight rustle of men moving a little apart, all along the centre of the room, to open a means of passing out, to the man with whom they had all bound themselves to renounce companionship.
<p/>Looking at no one, and going his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way with a lowly steadiness upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that asserted nothing and sought nothing, Old Stephen, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) troubles on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) head, left the scene.
<p/>Then Slackbridge, who had kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) oratorical arm extended during the going out, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) were repressing with infinite solicitude and by a wonderful moral power the vehement passions of the multitude, applied himself to raising their spirits.
<p/>If there is any right for me at aw, my friends, I think 'tis that.' Not a word was spoken. Had not the Roman Brutus, oh, my British countrymen, condemned his (<font color='blue'><b>Brutus</b></font>) son to death; and had not the Spartan mothers,
<p/>Then was it not the sacred duty of the men of Coketown, with forefathers before them, an admiring world in company with them, and a posterity to come after them, to hurl out traitors from the tents they had pitched in a sacred and a God-like cause?
<p/>oh my soon to be victorious friends, driven their flying children on the points of their enemies' swords? The winds of heaven answered Yes; and bore Yes, east, west, north, and south.
<p/>And consequently three cheers for the United Aggregate Tribunal! Slackbridge acted as fugleman, and gave the time. The multitude of doubtful faces -LRB-a little conscience-stricken-RRB- brightened at the sound, and took it up.
<p/>Private feeling must yield to the common cause. Hurrah! The roof yet vibrated with the cheering, when the assembly dispersed. Thus easily did Stephen Blackpool fall into the loneliest of lives, the life of solitude among a familiar crowd.
<p/>The stranger in the land who looks into ten thousand faces for some answering look and never finds it, is in cheering society as compared with him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) who passes ten averted faces daily, that were once the countenances of friends.
<p/>Such experience was to be Stephen's now, in every waking moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) life; at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) work, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) way to it and from it, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) door, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) window, everywhere.
<p/>By general consent, they even avoided that side of the street on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) habitually walked; and left it, of all the working men, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) only.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had been for many years, a quiet silent man, associating but little with other men, and used to companionship with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own thoughts.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had never known before the strength of the want in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) heart for the frequent recognition of a nod, a look, a word; or the immense amount of relief that had been poured into it by drops through such small means.
<p/>It was even harder than he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could have believed possible, to separate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own conscience his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) abandonment by all his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) fellows from a baseless sense of shame and disgrace.
<p/>The first four days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) endurance were days so long and heavy, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) began to be appalled by the prospect before him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).
<p/>Not only did he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) see no Rachael all the time, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) avoided every chance of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>); for, although he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knew that the prohibition did not yet formally extend to the women working in the factories, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) found that some of them with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was acquainted were changed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) feared to try others, and dreaded that Rachael might be even singled out from the rest if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) were seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) company.
<p/>So, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had been quite alone during the four days, and had spoken to no one, when, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) was leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) work at night, a young man of a very light complexion accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) in the street. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stephen coloured to find himself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) gratitude for being spoken to, or in the suddenness of it, or both.
<p/>Your name's Blackpool, ain't it?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the young man. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made a feint of adjusting the lining, and said, <div class="bookquote">`Yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are the Hand they have sent to Coventry, I mean?'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, the very light young man in question. Stephen answered <div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I supposed so, from their all appearing to keep away from you. Mr. Bounderby wants to speak to you. You know his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) house, don't you?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen said <div class="bookquote">`Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>again. <div class="bookquote">` Then go straight up there, will you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">` You're expected, and have only to tell the servant it's you.
<p/>I belong to the Bank; so, if you go straight up without me -LRB-I was sent to fetch you-RRB-, you'll save me a walk.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen, whose way had been in the contrary direction, turned about, and betook himself as in duty bound, to the red brick castle of the giant Bounderby.
<p/>CHAPTER V - MEN AND MASTERS <div class="bookquote">`WELL, Stephen ,'  (<font color='red'><b>MEN MASTERS</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) windy manner, <div class="bookquote">`what's this I hear? What have these pests of the earth been doing to you?
<p/>A tea-table was set out; and Mr. Bounderby's young wife, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother, and a great gentleman from London, were present.
<p/>Come in, and speak up.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

To whom Stephen made his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) obeisance, closing the door and standing near it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand. `
<p/>The gentleman he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) addressed, who was talking to Mrs. Bounderby on the sofa, got up, saying in an indolent way, <div class="bookquote">`Oh really?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bounderby</b></font>)</div>and dawdled to the hearthrug where Mr. Bounderby stood. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is the man I was telling you about, Harthouse,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby.

<p/>Besides being a rough handling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) wounded mind, it seemed to assume that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) really was the self- interested deserter he (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) had been called. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What were it, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, <div class="bookquote">`as yo were pleased to want wi'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>me?' <div class="bookquote">`Why, I have told you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>Mr. Bounderby, who was always more or less like a Wind, finding something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) way here, began to blow at it directly. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When this man was here once before, I warned this man against the mischievous strangers who are always about - and who ought to be hanged wherever they are found - and I told this man that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was going in the wrong direction.
<p/>Now, would you believe it, that although they have put this mark upon him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is such a slave to them still, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s afraid to open his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lips about them?'

<p/>Quite different things. You had better tell us so at once; you can't deceive me. You want to tell us so.

<p/>You'll say, upon my soul this is a tidy specimen of what my friends have to deal with; but this is nothing, sir!

<p/>` Why yes, sir. <div class="bookquote">` Now, Mr. Harthouse, you have been knocking about in the world some time. Did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed country?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><p/>Nay, ma'am,' said Stephen Blackpool, staunchly protesting against the words that had been used, and instinctively addressing himself to Louisa, after glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face. `
<p/>And Mr. Bounderby pointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) out for inspection, with an angry finger. ` Not rebels, nor yet rascals. Nowt o <div class="bookquote">` th'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>kind, ma'am, nowt o' th' kind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke with the rugged earnestness of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) place and character - deepened perhaps by a proud consciousness that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was faithful to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) class under all their mistrust; but he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) fully remembered where he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was, and did not even raise his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><p/>You are quite sure of that before we go any further.' ` Sir, I am sure on <div class="bookquote">`t.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>` Stephen bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) head to the gentleman from London, and showed a rather more troubled mind than usual.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) eyes involuntarily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) former refuge, but at a look from that quarter -LRB-expressive though instantaneous-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) settled them on Mr. Bounderby's face. <div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>We'll indict the blackguards for felony, and get 'em shipped off to penal settlements.' Stephen gravely shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) head. ` <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>So 'tis wi' Slackbridge every bit.' Reverting for a moment to his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) former refuge, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) observed a cautionary movement of her (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) eyes towards the door.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had not spoken out of his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) own will and desire; and he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) felt it in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) heart a noble return for his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) late injurious treatment to be faithful to the last to those who had repudiated him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>).
<p/>Stepping back, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) hand upon the lock.

<p/>I told you, the last time you were here with a grievance, that you had better turn about and come out of that.

<p/>You are such a waspish, raspish, ill-conditioned chap, you see,' said Mr. Bounderby, `that even your own Union, the men who know you best, will have nothing to do with you.
<p/>Stephen shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) head, mutely protesting that indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had other business to do for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) life. <div class="bookquote">` I never thought those fellows could be right in anything; but I tell you what!

<p/>You can finish off what you're at,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, with a meaning nod, <div class="bookquote">`and then go elsewhere.'

<p/>The reply was, <div class="bookquote">`What I know, I know; and what you know, you know. I have no more to say about it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen glanced at Louisa again, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes were raised to his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) no more; therefore, with a sigh, and saying, barely above his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) breath, <div class="bookquote">`Heaven help us aw in this world!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><p/>The shadows of night had gathered so fast, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) did not look about him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) closed the door, but plodded straight along the street.
<p/>Nothing was further from his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) thoughts than the curious old woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had encountered on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) previous visit to the same house, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) heard a step behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knew, and turning, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in Rachael's company.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) departed. CHAPTER VI - FADING AWAY IT was falling dark when Stephen came out of Mr. Bounderby's house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) saw Rachael first, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) only. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ah, Rachael, my dear!

<p/>But how wi'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Rachael?' said Stephen, falling into their step, walking between them, and looking from the one to the other. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, I come to be with this good lass pretty much as I came to be with you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said the old woman, cheerfully, taking the reply upon herself. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My visiting time is later this year than usual, for I have been rather troubled with shortness of breath, and so put it off till the weather was fine and warm.
<p/>For the same reason I don't make all my journey in one day, but divide it into two days, and get a bed to-night at the Travellers'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>Coffee House down by the railroad -LRB-a nice clean house-RRB-, and go back Parliamentary, at six in the morning.
<p/>Here I am again, you see.' <div class="bookquote">` Well, but what has this to do with this good lass, says you? I'm going to tell you.
<p/>I have heard of Mr. Bounderby being married. I read it in the paper, where it looked grand - oh, it looked fine!'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>the old woman dwelt on it with strange enthusiasm: <div class="bookquote">`and I want to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) wife. I have never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) yet.
<p/>So not to give her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) up too easily, I was waiting about, a little last bit more, when I passed close to this good lass two or three times; and her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) face being so friendly
<p/>Now, if you'll believe me, she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) hasn't come out of that house since noon to- day. I spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>lass</b></font>) spoke to me.
<p/>There!'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman to Stephen, <div class="bookquote">`you can make all the rest out for yourself now, a deal shorter than I can, I dare say!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><p/>Once again, Stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike this old woman, though her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) manner was as honest and simple as a manner possibly could be.
<p/>With a gentleness that was as natural to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) knew it to be to Rachael, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) pursued the subject that interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) old age. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, missus ,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`I ha seen the lady, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were young and hansom. Wi'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, Rachael, as I ha never seen the like on.' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Young and handsome. Yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried the old woman, quite delighted. <div class="bookquote">` As bonny as a rose! And what a happy wife!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Aye, missus, I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>missus</b></font>) be,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. But with a doubtful glance at Rachael. <div class="bookquote">` Suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) be? She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) must be.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>)'s your master's wife,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>returned the old woman. Stephen nodded assent. <div class="bookquote">` Though as to master,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), glancing again at Rachael, `not master onny more.
<p/>That's aw enden <div class="bookquote">`twixt him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) and me.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Have you left his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) work, Stephen?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>asked Rachael, anxiously and quickly. <div class="bookquote">` Why, Rachael,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">`whether I ha lef'n his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) work, or
<p/>whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) work ha lef'n me, cooms t'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>th' same. His (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) work and me are parted. <div class="bookquote">` Tis as weel so - better, I were thinkin when yo coom up wi'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>me.
<p/>It would ha brought'n trouble upon trouble if I had stayed theer. Haply 'tis a kindness to monny that I go; haply 'tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it mun be done.
<p/>I mun turn my face fro Coketown fur th' time, and seek a fort`n, dear, by beginnin fresh.' <div class="bookquote">`Where will you go, Stephen?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I donno t`night,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), lifting off his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hat, and smoothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) thin hair with the flat of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand. `
<p/>But I'm not goin t`night, Rachael, nor yet t`morrow. <div class="bookquote">` Tan't easy overmuch t'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>know wheer t' turn, but a good heart will coom to me.'
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had so much as closed Mr. Bounderby's door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had reflected that at least his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) being obliged to go away was good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), as it would save her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) from the chance of being brought into question for not withdrawing from him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).
<p/>Though it would cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) a hard pang to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) could think of no similar place in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) condemnation would not pursue him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the endurance of the last four days, even to unknown difficulties and distresses.
<p/>Herein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). So he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said, with truth, `I'm more leetsome, Rachael, under <div class="bookquote">`t, than I could'n ha believed.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) part to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) burden heavier. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) answered with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) comforting smile, and the three walked on together.
<p/>The old woman was so decent and contented, and made so light of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) infirmities, though they had increased upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) former interview with Stephen, that they both took an interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was too sprightly to allow of their walking at a slow pace on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) account, but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was very grateful to be talked to, and very willing to talk to any extent:
<p/>Age, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful, finds much consideration among the poor. so, when they came to their part of the town, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was more brisk and vivacious than ever. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come to my poor place, missus,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, <div class="bookquote">`and tak a coop o'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>tea. Rachael will coom then; and arterwards I'll see thee safe t' thy Travellers' lodgin. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>T may be long, Rachael, ere ever I ha th'  (<font color='red'><b>Travellers</b></font>)</div>chance o' thy coompany agen.' They complied, and the three went on to the house where he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) lodged.
<p/>When they turned into a narrow street, Stephen glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) window with a dread that always haunted his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) desolate home; but it was open, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had left it, and no one was there.
<p/>The evil spirit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) life had flitted away again, months ago, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had heard no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) since.
<p/>The only evidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) last return now, were the scantier moveables in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) room, and the grayer hair upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) lighted a candle, set out his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) little tea-board, got hot water from below, and brought in small portions of tea and sugar, a loaf, and some butter from the nearest shop.
<p/>The bread was new and crusty, the butter fresh, and the sugar lump, of course - in fulfilment of the standard testimony of the Coketown magnates, that these people lived like princes, sir.
<p/>Rachael made the tea -LRB-so large a party necessitated the borrowing of a cup-RRB-, and the visitor enjoyed it mightily. It was the first glimpse of sociality the host had had for many days.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) too, with the world a wide heath before him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), enjoyed the meal - again in corroboration of the magnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of these people, sir. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I ha never thowt yet, missus,'  (<font color='red'><b>these people</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, <div class="bookquote">`o'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>askin thy name.' The old lady announced herself as <div class="bookquote">`Mrs. Pegler.'  (<font color='red'><b>The lady</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>Mrs. Pegler's husband -LRB-one of the best on record-RRB- was already dead, by Mrs. Pegler's calculation, when Stephen was born. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A widder, I think?'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">` Oh, many long years!'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Onny children?'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Pegler's cup, rattling against her (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) saucer as she (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) held it, denoted some nervousness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) part. <div class="bookquote">` No,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not now, not now.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Dead, Stephen,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>Rachael softly hinted. ` I'm sooary I ha spok'n on <div class="bookquote">`t,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, <div class="bookquote">`I ought t'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>hadn in my mind as I might touch a sore place.
<p/>I had a son,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual appearances of sorrow; <div class="bookquote">`and he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) did well, wonderfully well.
<p/>I - I blame myseln.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>While he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) excused himself, the old lady's cup rattled more and more. ` But he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is not to be spoken of if you please.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is - ` Putting down her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cup, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hands as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would have added, by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) action, <div class="bookquote">`dead!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen had not yet got the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) having given the old lady pain, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) to the door, whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) ear.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>landlady</b></font>) said aloud, <div class="bookquote">`I have lost him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Pegler was by no means deaf, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) caught a word as it was uttered. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bounderby!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the table. ` Oh hide me! Don't let me be seen for the world.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) trembled, and was excessively agitated; getting behind Rachael, when Rachael tried to reassure her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>); and not seeming to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was about. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) come up till I've got away. Pray, pray!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But hearken, missus, hearken,' said Stephen, astonished. '' Tisn't Mr. Bounderby; 'tis his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Yo'r not fearfo' o' her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Yo was hey-go-mad about her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but an hour sin.' <div class="bookquote">` But are you sure it's the lady, and not the gentleman?'
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked, still trembling. <div class="bookquote">` Certain sure!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Well then, pray don't speak to me, nor yet take any notice of me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>said the old woman. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Stephen nodded; looking to Rachael for an explanation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was quite unable to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>); took the candle, went downstairs, and in a few moments returned, lighting Louisa into the room.
<p/>Rachael had risen, and stood apart with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) shawl and bonnet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hand, when Stephen, himself profoundly astonished by this visit, put the candle on the table.
<p/>Let me be quite to myself in this corner.'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was followed by the whelp. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) too stood, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) doubled hand upon the table near it, waiting to be addressed.
<p/>For the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) life Louisa had come into one of the dwellings of the Coketown Hands; for the first time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was face to face with anything like individuality in connection with them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) knew of their existence by hundreds and by thousands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) knew what results in work a given number of them would produce in a given space of time.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) knew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) reading infinitely more of the ways of toiling insects than of these toiling men and women.
<p/>Something to be worked so much and paid so much, and there ended; something to be infallibly settled by laws of supply and demand; something that blundered against those laws, and floundered into difficulty; something that was a little pinched when wheat was dear, and over-ate itself when wheat was cheap; something that increased at such a rate of percentage, and yielded such another percentage of crime, and such another percentage of pauperism; something wholesale, of which vast fortunes were made; something that occasionally rose like a sea, and did some harm and waste -LRB-chiefly to itself-RRB-, and fell again; this she (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) knew the Coketown Hands to be.
<p/>But, she (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) had scarcely thought more of separating them into units, than of separating the sea itself into its component drops.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) knew them in crowds passing to and from their nests, like ants or beetles. She (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) stood for some moments looking round the room.
<p/>From the few chairs, the few books, the common prints, and the bed, she (<font color='blue'><b>itself</b></font>) glanced to the two women, and to Stephen. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now. I should like to be serviceable to you, if you will let me.
<p/>I remember,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, reddening at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) mistake; <div class="bookquote">`I recollect, now, to have heard your domestic misfortunes spoken of, though I was not attending to the particulars at the time.
<p/>Is this your wife?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>Rachael raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) eyes, and they sufficiently answered no, and dropped again. <div class="bookquote">` It was not my meaning to ask a question that would give pain to any one here.
<p/>If I should ask any other question that may happen to have that result, give me credit, if you please, for being in ignorance how to speak to you as I ought.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>As Stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) now instinctively addressed herself to Rachael.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) manner was short and abrupt, yet faltering and timid. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) has told you what has passed between himself and my husband?
<p/>You would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) first resource, I think.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I have heard the end of it, young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>said Rachael. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Did I understand, that, being rejected by one employer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) would probably be rejected by all? I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said as much?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>The chances are very small, young lady - next to nothing - for a man who gets a bad name among them.'
<p/>` <div class="bookquote">` What shall I understand that you mean by a bad name?'  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` The name of being troublesome.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Then, by the prejudices of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own class, and by the prejudices of the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is sacrificed alike?
<p/>Are the two so deeply separated in this town, that there is no place whatever for an honest workman between them?'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) fell into suspicion,' said Louisa, `with his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) fellow-weavers, because - he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) had made a promise not to be one of them.
<p/>Rachael shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) head in silence. <div class="bookquote">` I think it must have been to you that he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) made that promise. Might I ask you why he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) made it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>Rachael burst into tears. <div class="bookquote">` I didn't seek it of him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>), poor lad. I prayed him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) to avoid trouble for his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) own good, little thinking he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)'d come to it through me.
<p/>But I know he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)'d die a hundred deaths, ere ever he (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>)'d break his (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) word. I know that of him (<font color='blue'><b>workman</b></font>) well.'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>Stephen had remained quietly attentive, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) usual thoughtful attitude, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand at his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) chin.
<p/>No one, excepting myseln, can ever know what honour, an' what love, an' respect, I bear to Rachael, or wi' what cause.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) now spoke in a voice rather less steady than usual. <div class="bookquote">` When I passed that promess, I towd her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) true, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) were th'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Angel o' my life. `
<p/>Twere a solemn promess. <div class="bookquote">` Tis gone fro'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>me, for ever.' Louisa turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head to him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>), and bent it with a deference that was new in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) looked from him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>) to Rachael, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) features softened. <div class="bookquote">` What will you do?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Angel</b></font>). And her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) voice had softened too. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Weel, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Stephen, making the best of it, with a smile; <div class="bookquote">`when I ha finished off, I mun quit this part, and try another.
<p/>Fortnet or misfortnet, a man can but try; there's nowt to be done wi'out tryin'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>- cept laying down and dying.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">`How will you travel?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Afoot, my kind ledy, afoot.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>Louisa coloured, and a purse appeared in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hand. The rustling of a bank-note was audible, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) unfolded one and laid it on the table. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Rachael, will you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) - for you know how, without offence - that this is freely his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), to help him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way?
<p/>Will you entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to take it?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I canna do that, young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answered, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head aside. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bless you for thinking o'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the poor lad wi' such tenderness. But 'tis for him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) to know his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) heart, and what is right according to it.'
<p/>Louisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in part overcome with quick sympathy, when this man of so much self- command, who had been so plain and steady through the late interview, lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) composure in a moment, and now stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face.
<p/>Not e`en Rachael,' said Stephen, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) stood again with his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) face uncovered, `could mak sitch a kind offerin, by onny words, kinder.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) stretched out hers, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) would have touched him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>); then checked herself, and remained still. <div class="bookquote">` T'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>show that I'm not a man wi'out reason and gratitude, I'll tak two pound.

<p/>I'll borrow <div class="bookquote">`t for t'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>pay `t back. ` She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was fain to take up the note again, and to substitute the much smaller sum he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had named.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was neither courtly, nor handsome, nor picturesque, in any respect; and yet his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner of accepting it, and of expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thanks without more words, had a grace in it that Lord Chesterfield could not have taught his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) son in a century.
<p/>Tom had sat upon the bed, swinging one leg and sucking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) walking- stick with sufficient unconcern, until the visit had attained this stage.
<p/>Seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister ready to depart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) got up, rather hurriedly, and put in a word. <div class="bookquote">` Just wait a moment, Loo!
<p/>Before we go, I should like to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) a moment. Something comes into my head. If you'll step out on the stairs, Blackpool, I'll mention it.
<p/>Never mind a light, man!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Tom was remarkably impatient of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) moving towards the cupboard, to get one. <div class="bookquote">` It don't want a light.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) out, and Tom closed the room door, and held the lock in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand. <div class="bookquote">` I say!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) whispered. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I think I can do you a good turn. Don't ask me what it is, because it may not come to anything.
<p/>But there's no harm in my trying.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) breath fell like a flame of fire on Stephen's ear, it was so hot. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That was our light porter at the Bank,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">`who brought you the message to-night.

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Stephen thought, <div class="bookquote">`What a hurry he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) is in!'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) spoke so confusedly. <div class="bookquote">` Well!'

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` T'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>day's Monday,' replied Stephen, considering. ` Why, sir, Friday or Saturday, nigh <div class="bookquote">`bout.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Friday or Saturday,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am not sure that I can do you the good turn I want to do you - that's my sister, you know, in your room - but I may be able to, and if I should not be able to, there's no harm done.

(<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, sure,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">` Very well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>returned Tom. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When you leave work of a night, between this and your going away, just hang about the Bank an hour or so, will you?
<p/>Don't take on, as if you meant anything, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) should see you hanging about there; because I shan't put him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) up to speak to you, unless I find I can do you the service I want to do you.
<p/>In that case he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)'ll have a note or a message for you, but not else. Now look here! You are sure you understand.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had wormed a finger, in the darkness, through a button-hole of Stephen's coat, and was screwing that corner of the garment tight up round and round, in an extraordinary manner. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I understand, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Stephen. <div class="bookquote">` Now look here!'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>repeated Tom. ` Be sure you don't make any mistake then, and don't forget.
<p/>I shall tell my sister as we go home, what I have in view, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'ll approve, I know. Now look here!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) pushed the door open as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) called to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), but did not return into the room, or wait to be lighted down the narrow stairs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was at the bottom when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) began to descend, and was in the street before she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could take his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm.
<p/>Mrs. Pegler remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) corner until the brother and sister were gone, and until Stephen came back with the candle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hand.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) was in a state of inexpressible admiration of Mrs. Bounderby, and, like an unaccountable old woman, wept, <div class="bookquote">`because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was such a pretty dear.'
 (<font color='red'><b>an woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet Mrs. Pegler was so flurried lest the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) admiration should return by chance, or anybody else should come, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) cheerfulness was ended for that night.
<p/>It was late too, to people who rose early and worked hard; therefore the party broke up; and Stephen and Rachael escorted their mysterious acquaintance to the door of the Travellers' Coffee House, where they parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>).
<p/>They walked back together to the corner of the street where Rachael lived, and as they drew nearer and nearer to it, silence crept upon them.
<p/>When they came to the dark corner where their unfrequent meetings always ended, they stopped, still silent, as if both were afraid to speak. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You're all right, are you? You understand all about it? Very well then. Come along, Loo!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shall strive t' see thee agen, Rachael, afore I go, but if not - ` `
<p/>Thou wilt not, Stephen, I know. <div class="bookquote">` Tis better that we make up our minds to be open wi'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>one another.' `
<p/>I ha been thinkin then, Rachael, that as 'tis but a day or two that remains, <div class="bookquote">`twere better for thee, my dear, not t'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>be seen wi' me. `
<p/>Thou`rt awlus right. <div class="bookquote">` Tis bolder and better. T might bring thee into trouble, fur no good.'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>'' Tis not for that, Stephen, that I mind.
<p/>But thou know`st our old agreement. <div class="bookquote">` Tis for that.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, well,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>). '' Tis better, onnyways.' <div class="bookquote">` Thou`lt write to me, and tell me all that happens, Stephen?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes. What can I say now, but Heaven be wi'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>thee , Heaven bless thee, Heaven thank thee and reward thee!' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>May it bless thee, Stephen, too, in all thy wanderings, and send thee peace and rest at last!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I towd thee, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Stephen Blackpool - <div class="bookquote">`that night - that I would never see or think
<p/>o'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>onnything that angered me, but thou, so much better than me, should`st be beside it. Thou`rt beside it now. Thou mak`st me see it wi' a better eye.
<p/>It was but a hurried parting in a common street, yet it was a sacred remembrance to these two common people.
<p/>Utilitarian economists, skeletons of schoolmasters, Commissioners of Fact, genteel and used-up infidels, gabblers of many little dog's-eared creeds, the poor you will have always with you.
<p/>Cultivate in them, while there is yet time, the utmost graces of the fancies and affections, to adorn their lives so much in need of ornament; or, in the day of your triumph, when romance is utterly driven out of their souls, and they and a bare existence stand face to face, Reality will take a wolfish turn, and make an end of you.
<p/>Stephen worked the next day, and the next, uncheered by a word from any one, and shunned in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) comings and goings as before.
<p/>Bless thee. Good night. Good-bye!' At the end of the second day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) saw land; at the end of the third, his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) loom stood empty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had overstayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) hour in the street outside the Bank, on each of the two first evenings; and nothing had happened there, good or bad.
<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) might not be remiss in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) part of the engagement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) resolved to wait full two hours, on this third and last night.
<p/>There was the lady who had once kept Mr. Bounderby's house, sitting at the first-floor window as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) before; and there was the light porter, sometimes talking with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) there, and sometimes looking over the blind below which had BANK upon it, and sometimes coming to the door and standing on the steps for a breath of air.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) first came out, Stephen thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) might be looking for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and passed near; but the light porter only cast his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) winking eyes upon him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) slightly, and said nothing.
<p/>Stephen sat upon the step of a door, leaned against a wall under an archway, strolled up and down, listened for the church clock, stopped and watched children playing in the street.
<p/>Two hours were a long stretch of lounging about, after a long day's labour. Some purpose or other is so natural to every one, that a mere loiterer always looks and feels remarkable.
<p/>When the first hour was out, Stephen even began to have an uncomfortable sensation upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) of being for the time a disreputable character.
<p/>Then came the lamplighter, and two lengthening lines of light all down the long perspective of the street, until they were blended and lost in the distance.
<p/>Presently, a light went up-stairs after her (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), passing first the fanlight of the door, and afterwards the two staircase windows, on its way up.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit closed the first-floor window, drew down the blind, and went up-stairs. By and by, one corner of the second-floor blind was disturbed, as if Mrs. Sparsit's eye were there;
<p/>also the other corner, as if the light porter's eye were on that side. Still, no communication was made to Stephen.
<p/>Much relieved when the two hours were at last accomplished, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) went away at a quick pace, as a recompense for so much loitering.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had only to take leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) landlady, and lie down on his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) temporary bed upon the floor; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) bundle was made up for to- morrow, and all was arranged for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) departure.
<p/>It was barely daybreak, when, with a parting look round his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) room, mournfully wondering whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) should ever see it again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) went out.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) meant to be clear of the town very early; before the Hands were in the streets. The town was as entirely deserted as if the inhabitants had abandoned it, rather than hold communication with him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).
<p/>Everything looked wan at that hour. Even the coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky, like a sad sea.
<p/>By the place where Rachael lived, though it was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) way; by the red brick streets; by the great silent factories, not trembling yet; by the railway, where the danger-lights were waning in the strengthening day; by the railway's crazy neighbourhood, half pulled down and half built up; by scattered red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens were sprinkled with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by coal-dust paths and many varieties of ugliness; Stephen got to the top of the hill, and looked back.
<p/>Day was shining radiantly upon the town then, and the bells were going for the morning work. Domestic fires were not yet lighted, and the high chimneys had the sky to themselves.
<p/>Puffing out their poisonous volumes, they would not be long in hiding it; but, for half an hour, some of the many windows were golden, which showed the Coketown people a sun eternally in eclipse, through a medium of smoked glass.
<p/>So strange to turn from the chimneys to the birds. So strange, to have the road-dust on his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) feet instead of the coal-grit.
<p/>So strange to have lived to his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) time of life, and yet to be beginning like a boy this summer morning!
<p/>With these musings in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) bundle under his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) arm, Stephen took his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) attentive face along the high road.
<p/>And the trees arched over him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), whispering that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) left a true and loving heart behind. CHAPTER VII - GUNPOWDER MR.
<p/>With the aid of a little more coaching for the political sages, a little more genteel listlessness for the general society, and a tolerable management of the assumed honesty in dishonesty, most effective and most patronized of the polite deadly sins, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) speedily came to be considered of much promise.
<p/>The not being troubled with earnestness was a grand point in his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) favour, enabling him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) to take to the hard Fact fellows with as good a grace as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had been born one of the tribe, and to throw all other tribes overboard, as conscious hypocrites. `
<p/>JAMES HARTHOUSE, <div class="bookquote">`going in'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>for his (<font color='blue'><b>HARTHOUSE</b></font>) adopted party, soon began to score. Whom none of us believe, my dear Mrs. Bounderby, and who do not believe themselves.
<p/>The only difference between us and the professors of virtue or benevolence, or philanthropy - never mind the name - is, that we know it is all meaningless, and say so; while they know it equally and will never say so.'
<p/>Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) be shocked or warned by this reiteration? It was not so unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) father's principles, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) early training, that it need startle her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>).
<p/>Where was the great difference between the two schools, when each chained her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) down to material realities, and inspired her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) with no faith in anything else?
<p/>What was there in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) soul for James Harthouse to destroy, which Thomas Gradgrind had nurtured there in its state of innocence!
<p/>It was even the worse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) at this pass, that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) mind - implanted there before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) eminently practical father began to form it - a struggling disposition to believe in a wider and nobler humanity than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had ever heard of, constantly strove with doubts and resentments.
<p/>With doubts, because the aspiration had been so laid waste in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) youth. With resentments, because of the wrong that had been done her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), if it were indeed a whisper of the truth.
<p/>Upon a nature long accustomed to self-suppression, thus torn and divided, the Harthouse philosophy came as a relief and justification. Everything being hollow and worthless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had missed nothing and sacrificed nothing.
<p/>What did it matter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) father, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) proposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) husband. What did it matter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) said still.
<p/>With a scornful self-reliance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) asked herself, What did anything matter - and went on. Towards what? Step by step, onward and downward, towards some end, yet so gradually, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) believed herself to remain motionless.
<p/>As to Mr. Harthouse, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) tended, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) neither considered nor cared. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had no particular design or plan before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>): no energetic wickedness ruffled his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) lassitude.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) was as much amused and interested, at present, as it became so fine a gentleman to be; perhaps even more than it would have been consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) reputation to confess.
<p/>Soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arrival he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) languidly wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) brother, the honourable and jocular member, that the Bounderbys were <div class="bookquote">`great fun;'  (<font color='red'><b>the member</b></font>)</div>and further, that the female Bounderby, instead of being the Gorgon he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had expected, was young, and remarkably pretty.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was very often in their house, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) flittings and visitings about the Coketown district; and was much encouraged by Mr. Bounderby.
<p/>It was quite in Mr. Bounderby's gusty way to boast to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) world that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) didn't care about your highly connected people, but that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) wife Tom Gradgrind's daughter did, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was welcome to their company.
<p/>Mr. James Harthouse began to think it would be a new sensation, if the face which changed so beautifully for the whelp, would change for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) was quick enough to observe; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had a good memory, and did not forget a word of the brother's revelations.
<p/>After that, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wrote no more about them, and devoted his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) leisure chiefly to their house. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) interwove them with everything he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw of the sister, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) began to understand her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).
<p/>To be sure, the better and profounder part of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) character was not within his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) scope of perception; for in natures, as in seas, depth answers unto depth; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) soon began to read the rest with a student's eye.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby had taken possession of a house and grounds, about fifteen miles from the town, and accessible within a mile or two, by a railway striding on many arches over a wild country, undermined by deserted coal-shafts, and spotted at night by fires and black shapes of stationary engines at pits' mouths.
<p/>This country, gradually softening towards the neighbourhood of Mr. Bounderby's retreat, there mellowed into a rustic landscape, golden with heath, and snowy with hawthorn in the spring of the year, and tremulous with leaves and their shadows all the summer time.
<p/>The bank had foreclosed a mortgage effected on the property thus pleasantly situated, by one of the Coketown magnates, who, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) determination to make a shorter cut than usual to an enormous fortune, overspeculated himself by about two hundred thousand pounds.
<p/>These accidents did sometimes happen in the best regulated families of Coketown, but the bankrupts had no connexion whatever with the improvident classes.
<p/>It afforded Mr. Bounderby supreme satisfaction to instal himself in this snug little estate, and with demonstrative humility to grow cabbages in the flower-garden.
<p/>Why, sir,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would say to a visitor, <div class="bookquote">`I am told that Nickits,'  (<font color='red'><b>a visitor</b></font>)</div>the late owner, `gave seven hundred pound for that Seabeach.
<p/>Now, to be plain with you, if I ever, in the whole course of my life, take seven looks at it, at a hundred pound a look, it will be as much as I shall do.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) delighted to live, barrack- fashion, among the elegant furniture, and he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) bullied the very pictures with his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) origin. <div class="bookquote">` No, by George!
<p/>For years upon years, the only pictures in my possession, or that I could have got into my possession, by any means, unless I stole 'em, were the engravings of a man shaving himself in a boot, on the blacking bottles that I was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with, and that I sold when they were empty for a farthing a-piece, and glad to get it!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I don't forget that I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would address Mr. Harthouse in the same style. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Harthouse, you have a couple of horses down here. Bring half a dozen more if you like, and we'll find room for 'em.
<p/>There's stabling in this place for a dozen horses; and unless Nickits is belied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) kept the full number. A round dozen of 'em, sir.
<p/>When that man was a boy, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went to Westminster School. Went to Westminster School as a King's Scholar, when I was principally living on garbage, and sleeping in market baskets.
<p/>Why, if I wanted to keep a dozen horses - which I don't, for one's enough for me - I couldn't bear to see 'em in their stalls here, and think what my own lodging used to be.
<p/>You see this place; you know what sort of a place it is; you are aware that there's not a completer place of its size in this kingdom or elsewhere - I don't care where - and here, got into the middle of it, like a maggot into a nut, is Josiah Bounderby.
<p/>While Nickits -LRB-as a man came into my office, and told me yesterday-RRB-, Nickits, who used to act in Latin, in the Westminster School plays, with the chief- justices and nobility of this country applauding him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) till they were black in the face, is drivelling at this minute - drivelling, sir! - in a fifth floor, up a narrow dark back street in Antwerp.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><p/>It was among the leafy shadows of this retirement, in the long sultry summer days, that Mr. Harthouse began to prove the face which had set him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) wondering when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) first saw it, and to try if it would change for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I couldn't look at 'em, sir, and not order 'em out. Yet so things come round. Mrs. Bounderby, I esteem it a most fortunate accident that I find you alone here.
<p/>It was not by any wonderful accident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), the time of day being that at which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was always alone, and the place being her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) favourite resort.
<p/>It was an opening in a dark wood, where some felled trees lay, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would sit watching the fallen leaves of last year, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had watched the falling ashes at home.
<p/>I have for some time had a particular wish to speak to you.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) sat down beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), with a glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) face. `
<p/>Your brother. My young friend Tom - ` Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) colour brightened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with a look of interest. `
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face betrayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thoughts - perhaps without betraying him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), for it might have been according to its instructions so to do. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I never in my life,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">`saw anything so remarkable and so captivating as the lighting of those features!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Pardon me.
<p/>The expression of your sisterly interest is so beautiful - Tom should be so proud of it - I know this is inexcusable, but I am so compelled to admire.' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You know I am a sordid piece of human nature, ready to sell myself at any time for any reasonable sum, and altogether incapable of any Arcadian proceeding whatever.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Being so impulsive,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said composedly. <div class="bookquote">` Mrs. Bounderby, no: you know I make no pretence with you. I am waiting,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">`for your further reference to my brother.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are rigid with me, and I deserve it. I am as worthless a dog as you will find, except that I am not false - not false.
<p/>But you surprised and started me from my subject, which was your brother. I have an interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Have you an interest in anything, Mr. Harthouse?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) asked, half incredulously and half gratefully. ` If you had asked me when I first came here, I should have said no.
<p/>I must say now - even at the hazard of appearing to make a pretence, and of justly awakening your incredulity
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) made a slight movement, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) were trying to speak, but could not find voice; at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Harthouse, I give you credit for being interested in my brother.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Thank you.
<p/>You have done so much for him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), you are so fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>); your whole life, Mrs. Bounderby, expresses such charming self-forgetfulness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) account - pardon me again - I am running wide of the subject.
<p/>- yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I claim to deserve it. You know how little I do claim, but I will go that length. I am interested in him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) own sake.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had made the slightest action possible, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would have risen in a hurry and gone away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had turned the course of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) said at that instant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) remained. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mrs. Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) resumed, in a lighter manner, and yet with a show of effort in assuming it, which was even more expressive than the manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) dismissed; <div class="bookquote">`it is no irrevocable offence in a young fellow of your brother's years, if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is heedless, inconsiderate, and expensive - a little dissipated, in the common phrase.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Harthouse waiting, as if that were not her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) whole answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">`I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) does.'

<p/>Yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Everybody does lose who bets. May I hint at the probability of your sometimes supplying him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) with money for these purposes?'
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sat, looking down; but, at this question, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) eyes searchingly and a little resentfully. <div class="bookquote">` Acquit me of impertinent curiosity, my dear Mrs. Bounderby.
<p/>I think Tom may be gradually falling into trouble, and I wish to stretch out a helping hand to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) from the depths of my wicked experience.
<p/>- Shall I say again, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sake? Is that necessary?'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) seemed to try to answer, but nothing came of it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Candidly to confess everything that has occurred to me,'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said James Harthouse, again gliding with the same appearance of effort into his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) more airy manner; <div class="bookquote">`I will confide to you my doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) has had many advantages.
<p/>Whether - forgive my plainness - whether any great amount of confidence is likely to have been established between himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) most worthy father.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Or, between himself, and - I may trust to your perfect understanding of my meaning, I am sure - and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) highly esteemed brother-in-law.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">` I do not,'  (<font color='red'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, flushing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) own great remembrance in that wise, <div class="bookquote">`think it likely.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>` She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) flushed deeper and deeper, and was burning red when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) replied in a fainter voice, <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I do not think that likely, either.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Mrs. Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Harthouse, after a short silence, <div class="bookquote">`may there be a better confidence between yourself and me?
<p/>Tom has borrowed a considerable sum of you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You will understand, Mr. Harthouse,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) returned, after some indecision: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had been more or less uncertain, and troubled throughout the conversation, and yet had in the main preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) self-contained manner; <div class="bookquote">`you will understand that if I tell you what you press to know, it is not by way of complaint or regret.
<p/>I would never complain of anything, and what I have done I do not in the least regret.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` So spirited, too!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>thought James Harthouse. `
<p/>When I married, I found that my brother was even at that time heavily in debt. Heavily for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), I mean.
<p/>Heavily enough to oblige me to sell some trinkets. They were no sacrifice. I sold them very willingly. I attached no value to them.
<p/>Either she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) saw in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew, or she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) only feared in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) conscience that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knew, that she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) spoke of some of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) husband's gifts.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not known it before, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would have known it then, though he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had been a much duller man than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Since then, I have given my brother, at various times, what money I could spare: in short, what money I have had.
<p/>Confiding in you at all, on the faith of the interest you profess for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), I will not do so by halves.
<p/>Since you have been in the habit of visiting here, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has wanted in one sum as much as a hundred pounds.
<p/>They, were quite worthless to me.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stopped, and reddened again. I have not been able to give it to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).
<p/>I have felt uneasy for the consequences of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) being so involved, but I have kept these secrets until now, when I trust them to your honour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was a ready man, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw, and seized, an opportunity here of presenting her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own image to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), slightly disguised as her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) brother. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mrs. Bounderby, though a graceless person, of the world worldly, I feel the utmost interest, I assure you, in what you tell me.
<p/>I have held no confidence with any one, because - you anticipated my reason just now.'  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) abruptly broke off. I cannot possibly be hard upon your brother.
<p/>With all possible respect both for Mr. Gradgrind and for Mr. Bounderby, I think I perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) has not been fortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) training.
<p/>Bred at a disadvantage towards the society in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) part to play, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) rushes into these extremes for himself, from opposite extremes that have long been forced - with the very best intentions we have no doubt - upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Bounderby's fine bluff English independence, though a most charming characteristic, does not - as we have agreed - invite confidence.
<p/>If I might venture to remark that it is the least in the world deficient in that delicacy to which a youth mistaken, a character misconceived, and abilities misdirected, would turn for relief and guidance, I should express what it presents to my own view.'
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) sat looking straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>), across the changing lights upon the grass into the darkness of the wood beyond, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) face her (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) application of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) very distinctly uttered words. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have one great fault to find with Tom, however, which I cannot forgive, and for which I take him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) heavily to account.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I understand and share the wise consideration with which you regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) errors. All allowance,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) continued, `must be made. Louisa turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) face, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) what fault was that? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Perhaps,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) returned, <div class="bookquote">`I have said enough. Perhaps it would have been better, on the whole, if no allusion to it had escaped me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>`To relieve you from needless apprehension - and as this confidence regarding your brother, which I prize I am sure above all possible things, has been established between us - I obey.
<p/>I cannot forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) for not being more sensible in every word, look, and act of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) life, of the affection of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) best friend; of the devotion of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) best friend; of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) unselfishness; of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sacrifice.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` You alarm me, Mr. Harthouse. Pray let me know it.'  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>The return he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) makes her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), within my observation, is a very poor one.
<p/>Careless fellow as I am, I am not so indifferent, Mrs. Bounderby, as to be regardless of this vice in your brother, or inclined to consider it a venial offence.'
<p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) has done for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) demands his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) constant love and gratitude, not his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ill- humour and caprice. The wood floated before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) eyes were suffused with tears.
<p/>They rose from a deep well, long concealed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) heart was filled with acute pain that found no relief in them. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My better knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) circumstances, and my direction and advice in extricating them - rather valuable, I hope, as coming from a scapegrace on a much larger scale - will give me some influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and all I gain I shall certainly use towards this end.
<p/>In a word, it is to correct your brother in this, Mrs. Bounderby, that I must aspire. I have said enough, and more than enough.
<p/>I seem to be protesting that I am a sort of good fellow, when, upon my honour, I have not the least intention to make any protestation to that effect, and openly announce that I am nothing of the sort.
<p/>Yonder, among the trees,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) added, having lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) eyes and looked about; for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) closely until now; <div class="bookquote">`is your brother himself; no doubt, just come down.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seems to be loitering in this direction, it may be as well, perhaps, to walk towards him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and throw ourselves in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) way.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has been very silent and doleful of late. Perhaps, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brotherly conscience is touched - if there are such things as consciences.
<p/>Though, upon my honour, I hear of them much too often to believe in them.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) to rise, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) arm, and they advanced to meet the whelp.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was idly beating the branches as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lounged along: or he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stooped viciously to rip the moss from the trees with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stick.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was startled when they came upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was engaged in this latter pastime, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) colour changed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Whose name, Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Harthouse, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) shoulder and turning him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), so that they all three walked towards the house together, <div class="bookquote">`have you been carving on the trees?'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Halloa!' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) stammered; <div class="bookquote">`I didn't know you were here.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` Whose name?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>returned Tom. <div class="bookquote">` Oh! You mean what girl's name?'

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not much of that, Mr. Harthouse, unless some fair creature with a slashing fortune at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own disposal would take a fancy to me.
<p/>Or she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might be as ugly as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was rich, without any fear of losing me. I'd carve her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) name as often as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) liked.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Have you so proved it to be a failing of mine, Tom?'

<p/>I may have praised her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for being the contrary, and I should do it again, if I had as good reason.
<p/>Don't believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), Mrs. Bounderby. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) knows much better. However, never mind this now; it's not very interesting to you, and I am sick of the subject.'
 (<font color='red'><b>patron</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) stood looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) ascended the steps, and passed into the shadow of the door; then put his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) brother's shoulder again, and invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) with a confidential nod to a walk in the garden. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>They walked on to the house, where Louisa quitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) visitor's arm and went in. Tom, my fine fellow, I want to have a word with you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They had stopped among a disorder of roses - it was part of Mr. Bounderby's humility to keep Nickits's roses on a reduced scale - and Tom sat down on a terrace-parapet, plucking buds and picking them to pieces; while his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) powerful Familiar stood over him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), with a foot upon the parapet, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) figure easily resting on the arm supported by that knee.
<p/>They were just visible from her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) window. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) saw them. <div class="bookquote">` Tom, what's the matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh!

 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` My good fellow, so am I.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Tom. <div class="bookquote">` You are the picture of independence. Mr. Harthouse, I am in a horrible mess.
<p/>You have no idea what a state I have got myself into - what a state my sister might have got me out of, if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would only have done it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) took to biting the rosebuds now, and tearing them away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) teeth with a hand that trembled like an infirm old man's.
<p/>After one exceedingly observant look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) companion relapsed into his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) lightest air. <div class="bookquote">` Tom, you are inconsiderate: you expect too much of your sister.
<p/>You have had money of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), you dog, you know you have.'  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, Mr. Harthouse, I know I have. How else was I to get it?
<p/>Here's my father drawing what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) calls a line, and tying me down to it from a baby, neck and heels.
<p/>Here's old Bounderby always boasting that at my age he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) lived upon twopence a month, or something of that sort. Here's my mother who never has anything of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own, except her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) complaints.
<p/>What is a fellow to do for money, and where am I to look for it, if not to my sister?'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was almost crying, and scattered the buds about by dozens. Mr. Harthouse took him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) persuasively by the coat. ` But, my dear Tom, if your sister has not got it - ` <div class="bookquote">`Not got it, Mr. Harthouse?
<p/>I don't say she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has got it. I may have wanted more than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was likely to have got. But then she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ought to get it.
<p/>It's of no use pretending to make a secret of matters now, after what I have told you already; you know she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) didn't marry old Bounderby for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own sake, or for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) sake, but for my sake.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is not obliged to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is going to do with it; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is sharp enough; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could manage to coax it out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) chose.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could get it. Then why doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) get what I want, out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), for my sake? Then why doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) choose, when I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of what consequence it is?
<p/>But no. There she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sits in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) company like a stone, instead of making herself agreeable and getting it easily. I don't know what you may call this, but I call it unnatural conduct.'
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a piece of ornamental water immediately below the parapet, on the other side, into which Mr. James Harthouse had a very strong inclination to pitch Mr. Thomas Gradgrind junior, as the injured men of Coketown threatened to pitch their property into the Atlantic.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) preserved his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) easy attitude; and nothing more solid went over the stone balustrades than the accumulated rosebuds now floating about, a little surface-island. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Harthouse, <div class="bookquote">`let me try to be your banker.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`For God's sake,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>replied Tom, suddenly, <div class="bookquote">`don't talk about bankers!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Harthouse, as a thoroughly well-bred man, accustomed to the best society, was not to be surprised - he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) could as soon have been affected - but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) eyelids a little more, as if they were lifted by a feeble touch of wonder.
<p/>Albeit it was as much against the precepts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) school to wonder, as it was against the doctrines of the Gradgrind College. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And very white he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) looked, in contrast with the roses. Very white. What is the present need, Tom? Three figures? Out with them.
<p/>Mr. Harthouse,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Tom, now actually crying; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) tears were better than his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) injuries, however pitiful a figure he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) made: <div class="bookquote">`it's too late; the money is of no use to me at present.

 (<font color='red'><b>A friend</b></font>)</div><p/>A true friend! <div class="bookquote">` Whelp, whelp!'  (<font color='red'><b>A friend</b></font>)</div>thought Mr. Harthouse, lazily; <div class="bookquote">` what an Ass you are!'

<p/>And, my good fellow, if you will open your bedevilments to me when they come thick upon you, I may show you better ways out of them than you can find for yourself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>As a great kindness, Mr. Harthouse.' <div class="bookquote">` Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>returned the other, `it may be of more use by and by. <div class="bookquote">`Thank you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) head dismally, and chewing rosebuds. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Now, you see, Tom,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Harthouse in conclusion, himself tossing over a rose or two, as a contribution to the island, which was always drifting to the wall as if it wanted to become a part of the mainland: <div class="bookquote">`every man is selfish in everything he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does, and I am exactly like the rest of my fellow-creatures.

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>When Tom appeared before dinner, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind seemed heavy enough, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) body was on the alert; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) appeared before Mr. Bounderby came in. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Begin at once.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Certainly I will.

<p/>I know you are fond of me, and you know I am fond of you.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>After this, there was a smile upon Louisa's face that day, for some one else.
<p/>So much the less is the whelp the only creature that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) cares for,' thought James Harthouse, reversing the reflection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) first day's knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) pretty face. `
<p/>THE next morning was too bright a morning for sleep, and James Harthouse rose early, and sat in the pleasant bay window of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) dressing-room, smoking the rare tobacco that had had so wholesome an influence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) young friend.
<p/>Reposing in the sunlight, with the fragrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) eastern pipe about him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), and the dreamy smoke vanishing into the air, so rich and soft with summer odours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) reckoned up his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) advantages as an idle winner might count his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) gains.
<p/>Alas, for some one else! <div class="bookquote">` So much the less, so much the less.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VIII - EXPLOSION He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) was not at all bored for the time, and could give his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) mind to it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had established a confidence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), that absolutely turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) indifference towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) husband, and the absence, now and at all times, of any congeniality between them.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had established a confidence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), from which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) husband was excluded. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had artfully, but plainly, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) heart in its last most delicate recesses
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had come so near to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) through its tenderest sentiment; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had associated himself with that feeling; and the barrier behind which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) lived, had melted away.
<p/>Publicly and privately, it were much better for the age in which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) and the legion of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was one were designedly bad, than indifferent and purposeless.
<p/>All very odd, and very satisfactory! And yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had not, even now, any earnest wickedness of purpose in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). It is the drifting icebergs setting with any current anywhere, that wreck the ships.
<p/>When the Devil goeth about like a roaring lion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) goeth about in a shape by which few but savages and hunters are attracted.
<p/>But, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is trimmed, smoothed, and varnished, according to the mode; when he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is aweary of vice, and aweary of virtue, used up as to brimstone, and used up as to bliss; then, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) take to the serving out of red tape, or to the kindling of red fire, he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) is the very Devil.
<p/>So James Harthouse reclined in the window, indolently smoking, and reckoning up the steps he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had taken on the road by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) happened to be travelling.
<p/>The end to which it led was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), pretty plainly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) troubled himself with no calculations about it. What will be, will be.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had rather a long ride to take that day - for there was a public occasion <div class="bookquote">`to do'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>at some distance, which afforded a tolerable opportunity of going in for the Gradgrind men - he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) dressed early and went down to breakfast.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was anxious to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had relapsed since the previous evening. No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) resumed where he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had left off.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) got through the day as much -LRB-or as little-RRB- to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) own satisfaction, as was to be expected under the fatiguing circumstances; and came riding back at six o'clock.
<p/>There was a sweep of some half-mile between the lodge and the house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was riding along at a foot pace over the smooth gravel, once Nickits's, when Mr. Bounderby burst out of the shrubbery, with such violence as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) horse shy across the road. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There was a look of interest for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) again. Harthouse!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` Have you heard?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>`Heard what? ` said Harthouse, soothing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) horse, and inwardly favouring Mr. Bounderby with no good wishes. `
<p/>Mr. Bounderby, red and hot, planted himself in the centre of the path before the horse's head, to explode his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) bombshell with more effect. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Then you haven't heard!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I have heard you, and so has this brute. I have heard nothing else.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bank</b></font>)</div>The Bank's robbed!'
<p/><div class="bookquote">` You don't mean it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Bank</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Robbed last night, sir. Robbed in an extraordinary manner. Robbed with a false key.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Of much?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bounderby, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) desire to make the most of it, really seemed mortified by being obliged to reply, <div class="bookquote">`Why, no; not of very much.
<p/>Oh! as a sum - if you stick to a sum - of not more than a hundred and fifty pound,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, with impatience. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But it might have been.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Of how much?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But it's not the sum; it's the fact. It's the fact of the Bank being robbed, that's the important circumstance.
<p/>My dear Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said James, dismounting, and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) bridle to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) servant, <div class="bookquote">`I do see it; and am as overcome as you can possibly desire me to be, by the spectacle afforded to my mental view.
<p/>Nevertheless, I may be allowed, I hope, to congratulate you - which I do with all my soul, I assure you - on your not having sustained a greater loss.'  (<font color='red'><b>servant</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am surprised you don't see it.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Thank`ee,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>replied Bounderby, in a short, ungracious manner. <div class="bookquote">` But I tell you what.
<p/>It might have been twenty thousand pound.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I suppose it might.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Suppose it might! By the Lord, you may suppose so.
<p/>By George!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, with sundry menacing nods and shakes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` It might have been twice twenty.
<p/>There's no knowing what it would have been, or wouldn't have been, as it was, but for the fellows'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>being disturbed.'
<p/>Louisa had come up now, and Mrs. Sparsit, and Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">` Here's Tom Gradgrind's daughter knows pretty well what it might have been, if you don't,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>blustered Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Dropped, sir, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was shot when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)! Never knew her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) do such a thing before. Does her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) credit, under the circumstances, in my opinion!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>James Harthouse begged her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) arm; and as they moved on very slowly, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) how the robbery had been committed. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) still looked faint and pale. Why, I am going to tell you,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, irritably giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) arm to Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You know this lady -LRB-for she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a lady-RRB-, Mrs. Sparsit?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>`I have already had the honour - ` <div class="bookquote">`Very well.
<p/>If you hadn't been so mighty particular about the sum, I should have begun to tell you before. And this young man, Bitzer, you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) too on the same occasion?'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Harthouse inclined his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) head in assent, and Bitzer knuckled his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) forehead. <div class="bookquote">` Very well. They live at the Bank. You know they live at the Bank, perhaps?
<p/>Very well. Yesterday afternoon, at the close of business hours, everything was put away as usual. In the iron room that this young fellow sleeps outside of, there was never mind how much.
<p/>In the little safe in young Tom's closet, the safe used for petty purposes, there was a hundred and fifty odd pound.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A hundred and fifty-four, seven, one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer. <div class="bookquote">` Come!'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>retorted Bounderby, stopping to wheel round upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), `let's have none of your interruptions.
<p/>It's enough to be robbed while you're snoring because you're too comfortable, without being put right with your four seven ones.
<p/>I didn't snore, myself, when I was your age, let me tell you. I hadn't victuals enough to snore. And I didn't four seven one.
<p/>Bitzer knuckled his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) forehead again, in a sneaking manner, and seemed at once particularly impressed and depressed by the instance last given of Mr. Bounderby's moral abstinence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not if I knew it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>Some time in the night, while this young fellow snored - Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am, you say you have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) snore?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`I cannot say that I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) precisely snore, and therefore must not make that statement.
<p/>But on winter evenings, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) has fallen asleep at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) table, I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), what I should prefer to describe as partially choke.
<p/>I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) on such occasions produce sounds of a nature similar to what may be sometimes heard in Dutch clocks.
<p/>Not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, with a lofty sense of giving strict evidence, <div class="bookquote">`that I would convey any imputation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) moral character.
<p/>I have always considered Bitzer a young man of the most upright principle; and to that I beg to bear my testimony.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>Being then disturbed, they made off; letting themselves out at the main door, and double-locking it again -LRB-it was double-locked, and the key under Mrs. Sparsit's pillow-RRB- with a false key, which was picked up in the street near the Bank, about twelve o'clock to-day.
<p/>No alarm takes place, till this chap, Bitzer, turns out this morning, and begins to open and prepare the offices for business.
<p/>Everything was left, all right. Far from it. Then, looking at Tom's safe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sees the door ajar, and finds the lock forced, and the money gone.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>They would have been out of pocket if they had invested eighteenpence in the job; I can tell 'em that.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

<p/>I should think there was somebody suspected. Egod!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>No, thank you!'

<p/>It's not to be mentioned everywhere; it's not to be mentioned anywhere: in order that the scoundrels concerned -LRB-there's a gang of 'em-RRB- may be thrown off their guard.
<p/>So take this in confidence. Now wait a bit.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Louisa faintly uttered some word of incredulity and surprise. <div class="bookquote">` O yes! I know!'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, immediately catching at the sound. `
<p/>I know! I am used to that. I know all about it. They are the finest people in the world, these fellows are.
<p/>They have got the gift of the gab, they have. They only want to have their rights explained to them, they do.
<p/>But I tell you what. Show me a dissatisfied Hand, and I'll show you a man that's fit for anything bad

<p/>What warning did I give that fellow, the first time he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) set foot in the house, when the express object of his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) visit was to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) could knock Religion over, and floor the Established Church?
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit, in point of high connexions, you are on a level with the aristocracy, - did I say, or did I not say, to that fellow, ``you can't hide the truth from me
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am, I appeal to you. : you are not the kind of fellow I like; you'll come to no good''?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

<p/>Mr. Bounderby stared with a bursting pride at Mr. Harthouse, as much as to say, <div class="bookquote">`I am the proprietor of this female, and she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'s worth your attention, I think.'

<p/>You can recall for yourself, Harthouse, what I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) when you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>). I didn't mince the matter with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>).
<p/>Went off, nobody knows where: as my mother did in my infancy - only with this difference, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) is a worse subject than my mother, if possible.
<p/>I am never mealy with 'em. I KNOW 'em. Very well, sir. Three days after that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) bolted. What did he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) do before he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) went?

<p/>And to its appearing on inquiry to-day - that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) was also noticed by the neighbours?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>Suspicious,'  (<font color='red'><b>an dancer</b></font>)</div>said James Harthouse, <div class="bookquote">`certainly.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I think so, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, with a defiant nod. <div class="bookquote">` I think so. But there are more of 'em in it.
<p/>One never hears of these things till the mischief's done; all sorts of defects are found out in the stable door after the horse is stolen; there's an old woman turns up now.
<p/>There's an old woman. An old woman who seems to have been flying into town on a broomstick, every now and then.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) watches the place a whole day before this fellow begins, and on the night when you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) steals away with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) and holds a council with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) - I suppose, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) report on going off duty, and be damned to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>This is not all of 'em, even as we already know 'em,' said Bounderby, with many nods of hidden meaning. `
<p/>There was such a person in the room that night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shrunk from observation, thought Louisa. ` But I have said enough for the present.
<p/>You'll have the goodness to keep it quiet, and mention it to no one. It may take time, but we shall have 'em.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Of course, they will be punished with the utmost rigour of the law, as notice-boards observe,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>replied James Harthouse, <div class="bookquote">`and serve them right.
<p/>It's policy to give 'em line enough, and there's no objection to that.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>Fellows who go in for Banks must take the consequences.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had gently taken Louisa's parasol from her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hand, and had put it up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) walked under its shade, though the sun did not shine there. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If there were no consequences, we should all go in for Banks.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For the present, Loo Bounderby,' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) husband, <div class="bookquote">`here's Mrs. Sparsit to look after.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit's nerves have been acted upon by this business, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>)'ll stay here a day or two. So make her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) comfortable.'
 (<font color='red'><b>husband Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Thank you very much, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>that discreet lady observed, <div class="bookquote">`but pray do not let My comfort be a consideration. Anything will do for Me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div><p/>It soon appeared that if Mrs. Sparsit had a failing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) association with that domestic establishment, it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was so excessively regardless of herself and regardful of others, as to be a nuisance.
<p/>On being shown her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) chamber, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was so dreadfully sensible of its comforts as to suggest the inference that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) would have preferred to pass the night on the mangle in the laundry.
<p/>True, the Powlers and the Scadgerses were accustomed to splendour, <div class="bookquote">`but it is my duty to remember,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sparsit was fond of observing with a lofty grace: particularly when any of the domestics were present, <div class="bookquote">`that what I was, I am no longer.
<p/>Indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the domestics</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), `if I could altogether cancel the remembrance that Mr. Sparsit was a Powler, or that I myself am related to the Scadgers family; or if I could even revoke the fact, and make myself a person of common descent and ordinary connexions; I would gladly do so.
<p/>The same Hermitical state of mind led to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) renunciation of made dishes and wines at dinner, until fairly commanded by Mr. Bounderby to take them; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`Indeed you are very good, sir;'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and departed from a resolution of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had made rather formal and public announcement, to <div class="bookquote">`wait for the simple mutton.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was likewise deeply apologetic for wanting the salt; and, feeling amiably bound to bear out Mr. Bounderby to the fullest extent in the testimony he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had borne to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) nerves, occasionally sat back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) chair and silently wept; at which periods a tear of large dimensions, like a crystal ear-ring, might be observed -LRB-or rather, must be, for it insisted on public notice-RRB- sliding down her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) Roman nose.
<p/>I should think it, under existing circumstances, right to do so.' But Mrs. Sparsit's greatest point, first and last, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) determination to pity Mr. Bounderby.
<p/>There were occasions when in looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was involuntarily moved to shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head, as who would say, <div class="bookquote">`Alas, poor Yorick!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>After allowing herself to be betrayed into these evidences of emotion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) would force a lambent brightness, and would be fitfully cheerful, and would say, <div class="bookquote">`You have still good spirits, sir, I am thankful to find;'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and would appear to hail it as a blessed dispensation that Mr. Bounderby bore up as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) did.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had a curious propensity to call Mrs. Bounderby <div class="bookquote">`Miss Gradgrind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bounderby</b></font>)</div>and yielded to it some three or four score times in the course of the evening.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) repetition of this mistake covered Mrs. Sparsit with modest confusion; but indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) said, it seemed so natural to say Miss Gradgrind:
<p/>whereas, to persuade herself that the young lady whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had had the happiness of knowing from a child could be really and truly Mrs. Bounderby, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) found almost impossible.
<p/>It was a further singularity of this remarkable case, that the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) thought about it, the more impossible it appeared; <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>In the drawing-room after dinner, Mr. Bounderby tried the case of the robbery, examined the witnesses, made notes of the evidence, found the suspected persons guilty, and sentenced them to the extreme punishment of the law.
<p/>One idiosyncrasy for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) often apologized, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) found it excessively difficult to conquer. the differences,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) observed, <div class="bookquote">`being such.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>That done, Bitzer was dismissed to town with instructions to recommend Tom to come home by the mail- train.
<p/>When candles were brought, Mrs. Sparsit murmured, <div class="bookquote">`Don't be low, sir. Pray let me see you cheerful, sir, as I used to do.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bounderby, upon whom these consolations had begun to produce the effect of making him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), in a bull-headed blundering way, sentimental, sighed like some large sea-animal. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Try a hand at backgammon, sir, as you used to do when I had the honour of living under your roof.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I cannot bear to see you so, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` I haven't played backgammon, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`since that time.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` No, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, soothingly, <div class="bookquote">`I am aware that you have not. I remember that Miss Gradgrind takes no interest in the game.
<p/>But I shall be happy, sir, if you will condescend.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>They played near a window, opening on the garden. It was a fine night: not moonlight, but sultry and fragrant.
<p/>Louisa and Mr. Harthouse strolled out into the garden, where their voices could be heard in the stillness, though not what they said.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) place at the backgammon board, was constantly straining her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) eyes to pierce the shadows without. ` What's the matter, ma'am? ` said Mr. Bounderby; <div class="bookquote">`you don't see a Fire, do you?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Oh dear no, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`I was thinking of the dew.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What have you got to do with the dew, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's not myself, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`I am fearful of Miss Gradgrind's taking cold.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) never takes cold,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Really, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. And was affected with a cough in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) throat. When the time drew near for retiring, Mr. Bounderby took a glass of water. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` Not your sherry warm, with lemon-peel and nutmeg?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why, I have got out of the habit of taking it now, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>The more's the pity, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit; <div class="bookquote">`you are losing all your good old habits. Cheer up, sir! If Miss Gradgrind will permit me, I will offer to make it for you, as I have often done.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Gradgrind readily permitting Mrs. Sparsit to do anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) pleased, that considerate lady made the beverage, and handed it to Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It will do you good, sir. It will warm your heart. It is the sort of thing you want, and ought to take, sir.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>And when Mr. Bounderby said, <div class="bookquote">`Your health, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) answered with great feeling, <div class="bookquote">`Thank you, sir. The same to you, and happiness also.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Finally, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) good night, with great pathos; and Mr. Bounderby went to bed, with a maudlin persuasion that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had been crossed in something tender, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) could not, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) life, have mentioned what it was.
<p/>That could hardly be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) knew, until an hour past midnight; but in the country silence, which did anything but calm the trouble of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) thoughts, time lagged wearily.
<p/>At last, when the darkness and stillness had seemed for hours to thicken one another, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) heard the bell at the gate.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) felt as though she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) would have been glad that it rang on until daylight; but it ceased, and the circles of its last sound spread out fainter and wider in the air, and all was dead again.
<p/>Long after Louisa had undressed and lain down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) watched and waited for her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brother's coming home. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) waited yet some quarter of an hour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) judged.
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) arose, put on a loose robe, and went out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) room in the dark, and up the staircase to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brother's room.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) door being shut, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) softly opened it and spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), approaching his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) bed with a noiseless step. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) kneeled down beside it, passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) arm over his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) neck, and drew his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) face to hers.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) started by and by as if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were just then awakened, and asked who that was, and what was the matter? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) only feigned to be asleep, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) said nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Tom, have you anything to tell me?
<p/>If ever you loved me in your life, and have anything concealed from every one besides, tell it to me.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear brother:'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head down on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pillow, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hair flowed over him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) would hide him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from every one but herself: <div class="bookquote">`is there nothing that you have to tell me?

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`As you lie here alone, my dear, in the melancholy night, so you must lie somewhere one night, when even I, if I am living then, shall have left you.

<p/>You may be certain;'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>in the energy of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) love she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bosom as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) were a child; <div class="bookquote">`that I will not reproach you.
<p/>In the name of that time, Tom, tell me the truth now!'  (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What is it you want to know?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You may be certain that I will be compassionate and true to you.

(<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ear to his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) lips, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) remained doggedly silent. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not a word, Tom?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`How can I say Yes, or how can I say No, when I don't know what you mean

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You are tired,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whispered presently, more in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) usual way. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, I am quite tired out.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Have any fresh discoveries been made?' <div class="bookquote">`Only those you have heard of, from - him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Tom, have you said to any one that we made a visit to those people, and that we saw those three together?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`
<p/><div class="bookquote">` You have been so hurried and disturbed to-day. No. Didn't you yourself particularly ask me to keep it quiet when you asked me to go there with you?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes. But I did not know then what was going to happen.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Nor I neither. How could I?'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was very quick upon her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) with this retort. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ought I to say, after what has happened,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister, standing by the bed - she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had gradually withdrawn herself and risen, <div class="bookquote">`that I made that visit?
<p/>Should I say so? Must I say so?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Good Heavens, Loo,'  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>returned her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother, <div class="bookquote">`you are not in the habit of asking my advice.
<p/>say what you like. If you keep it to yourself, I shall keep it to myself. If you disclose it, there's an end of it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>It was too dark for either to see the other's face; but each seemed very attentive, and to consider before speaking. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tom, do you believe the man I gave the money to, is really implicated in this crime?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I don't know.
<p/>I don't see why he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) shouldn't be.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) seemed to me an honest man.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Another person may seem to you dishonest, and yet not be so.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>In short,' resumed Tom, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mind, <div class="bookquote">`if you come to that, perhaps I was so far from being altogether in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) favour, that I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) outside the door to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) quietly, that I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might consider himself very well off to get such a windfall as he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had got from my sister, and that I hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) would make good use of it.
<p/>I say nothing against the man; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be a very good fellow, for anything I know; I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was a pause, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had hesitated and stopped. ` You remember whether I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) out or not. <div class="bookquote">`Was he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offended by what you said?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) took it pretty well; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was civil enough. Where are you, Loo?'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) sat up in bed and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Good night, my dear, good night.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You have nothing more to tell me?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No. What should I have? You wouldn't have me tell you a lie!'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I wouldn't have you do that to-night, Tom, of all the nights in your life; many and much happier as I hope they will be.'
<p/>` <div class="bookquote">`Thank you, my dear Loo. I am so tired , that I am sure I wonder I don't say anything to get to sleep.
<p/>Kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) turned round, drew the coverlet over his (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) head, and lay as still as if that time had come by which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had adjured him (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>).
<p/>Go to bed, go to bed.'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stood for some time at the bedside before she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) slowly moved away. She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stopped at the door, looked back when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had opened it, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) had called her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)?
<p/>Then the wretched boy looked cautiously up and found her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gone, crept out of bed, fastened his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) door, and threw himself upon his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pillow again: tearing his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) hair, morosely crying, grudgingly loving her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), hatefully but impenitently spurning himself, and no less hatefully and unprofitably spurning all the good in the world.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) lay still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) softly closed the door and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) room. CHAPTER IX - HEARING THE LAST OF IT MRS.
<p/>SPARSIT, lying by to recover the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) nerves in Mr. Bounderby's retreat, kept such a sharp look-out, night and day, under her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Coriolanian eyebrows, that her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) eyes, like a couple of lighthouses on an iron-bound coast, might have warned all prudent mariners from that bold rock her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) Roman nose and the dark and craggy region in its neighbourhood, but for the placidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) manner.
<p/>Although it was hard to believe that her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) retiring for the night could be anything but a form, so severely wide awake were those classical eyes of hers, and so impossible
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) manner of sitting, smoothing her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) uncomfortable, not to say, gritty mittens -LRB-they were constructed of a cool fabric like a meat-safe-RRB-, or of ambling to unknown places of destination with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) foot in her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cotton stirrup, was so perfectly serene, that most observers would have been constrained to suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) a dove, embodied by some freak of nature, in the earthly tabernacle of a bird of the hook-beaked order.
<p/>did it seem that her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) rigid nose could yield to any relaxing influence, yet She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was a most wonderful woman for prowling about the house.
<p/>A lady so decorous in herself, and so highly connected, was not to be suspected of dropping over the banisters or sliding down them, yet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) extraordinary facility of locomotion suggested the wild idea.
<p/>How she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) got from story to story was a mystery beyond solution. Another noticeable circumstance in Mrs. Sparsit was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was never hurried.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) would shoot with consummate velocity from the roof to the hall, yet would be in full possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) breath and dignity on the moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) arrival there.
<p/>Neither was she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) ever seen by human vision to go at a great pace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) took very kindly to Mr. Harthouse, and had some pleasant conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) arrival.
<p/>It appears but yesterday, sir,' said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`that I had the honour of receiving you at the Bank, when you were so good as to wish to be made acquainted with Mr. Bounderby's address.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>An occasion, I am sure, not to be forgotten by myself in the course of Ages,' said Mr. Harthouse, inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) head to Mrs. Sparsit with the most indolent of all possible airs. `
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) stately curtsey in the garden, one morning before breakfast. ` <div class="bookquote">` We live in a singular world, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit.
<p/>I have had the honour, by a coincidence of which I am proud, to have made a remark, similar in effect, though not so epigrammatically expressed.' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A singular world, I would say, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>pursued Mrs. Sparsit; after acknowledging the compliment with a drooping of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) dark eyebrows, not altogether so mild in its expression as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) voice was in its dulcet tones; <div class="bookquote">`as regards the intimacies we form at one time, with individuals we were quite ignorant of, at another.
<p/>I recall, sir, that on that occasion you went so far as to say you were actually apprehensive of Miss Gradgrind.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I availed myself of your obliging hints to correct my timidity, and it is unnecessary to add that they were perfectly accurate.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit's talent for - in fact for anything requiring accuracy - with a combination of strength of mind - and Family - is too habitually developed to admit of any question.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) was almost falling asleep over this compliment; it took him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) so long to get through, and his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) mind wandered so much in the course of its execution. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You found Miss Gradgrind - I really cannot call her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) Mrs. Bounderby; it's very absurd of me - as youthful as I described her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Your memory does me more honour than my insignificance deserves. You drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) portrait perfectly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Harthouse. <div class="bookquote">` Presented her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) dead image.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Highly so.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`It used to be considered,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`that Miss Gradgrind was wanting in animation, but I confess she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) appears to me considerably and strikingly improved in that respect.
<p/>Very engaging, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, causing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mittens slowly to revolve over one another. <div class="bookquote">` Ay, and indeed here is Mr. Bounderby!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>cried Mrs. Sparsit, nodding her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head a great many times, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had been talking and thinking of no one else. `
<p/>Now, these persistent assuagements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) misery, and lightenings of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) load, had by this time begun to have the effect of making Mr. Bounderby softer than usual towards Mrs. Sparsit, and harder than usual to most other people from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) wife downward.
<p/>So, when Mrs. Sparsit said with forced lightness of heart, <div class="bookquote">`You want your breakfast, sir, but I dare say Miss Gradgrind will soon be here to preside at the table,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bounderby replied, <div class="bookquote">`If I waited to be taken care of by my wife, ma'am, I believe you know pretty well I should wait till Doomsday, so I'll trouble you to take charge of the teapot.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>How do you find yourself this morning, sir? Pray let us see you cheerful, sir.' Mrs. Sparsit complied, and assumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) old position at table.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was so humble withal, that when Louisa appeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) rose, protesting she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) never could think of sitting in that place under existing circumstances, often as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had had the honour of making Mr. Bounderby's breakfast, before Mrs. Gradgrind - she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) begged pardon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) meant to say Miss Bounderby
<p/>- she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hoped to be excused, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) really could not get it right yet, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) trusted to become familiar with it by and by - had assumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) present position.
<p/>It was only -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) observed-RRB- because Miss Gradgrind happened to be a little late, and Mr. Bounderby's time was so very precious, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) knew it of old to be so essential that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) should breakfast to the moment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had taken the liberty of complying with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) request; long as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) will had been a law to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This again made the excellent woman vastly sentimental. There! Stop where you are, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`stop where you are!
<p/>Mrs. Bounderby will be very glad to be relieved of the trouble, I believe.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Don't say that, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, almost with severity, <div class="bookquote">`because that is very unkind to Mrs. Bounderby.
<p/>- You can take it very quietly, can't you, Loo?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, in a blustering way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) wife. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And to be unkind is not to be you, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>`You may set your mind at rest, ma'am. Of course. It is of no moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why should it be of any importance to any one, Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, swelling with a sense of slight. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why should it be of any importance to me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>You attach too much importance to these things, ma'am. By George, you'll be corrupted in some of your notions here.
<p/>You are old- fashioned, ma'am. You are behind Tom Gradgrind's children's time.' <div class="bookquote">` What is the matter with you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Gradgrind children</b></font>)</div>asked Louisa, coldly surprised. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What has given you offence?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Offence!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>repeated Bounderby. ` Do you suppose if there was any offence given me, I shouldn't name it, and request to have it corrected?
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident, or too delicate,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Louisa answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) composedly: <div class="bookquote">`I have never made that objection to you, either as a child or as a woman.
<p/>I am a straightforward man, I believe. I don't go beating about for side-winds.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I don't understand what you would have.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Have?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing. Otherwise, don't you, Loo Bounderby, know thoroughly well that I, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, would have it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) struck the table and made the teacups ring, with a proud colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face that was a new change, Mr. Harthouse thought. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You are incomprehensible this morning,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said Louisa. <div class="bookquote">` Pray take no further trouble to explain yourself. I am not curious to know your meaning.
<p/>What does it matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>Nothing more was said on this theme, and Mr. Harthouse was soon idly gay on indifferent subjects.
<p/>But from this day, the Sparsit action upon Mr. Bounderby threw Louisa and James Harthouse more together, and strengthened the dangerous alienation from her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) husband and confidence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) with another, into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had fallen by degrees so fine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could not retrace them if she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) tried.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit was so much affected on this particular occasion, that, assisting Mr. Bounderby to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hat after breakfast, and being then alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) in the hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) imprinted a chaste kiss upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hand, murmured <div class="bookquote">`My benefactor!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet it is an indubitable fact, within the cognizance of this history, that five minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had left the house in the self-same hat, the same descendant of the Scadgerses and connexion by matrimony of the Powlers, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) right-hand mitten at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) portrait, made a contemptuous grimace at that work of art, and said <div class="bookquote">`Serve you right, you Noodle, and I am glad of it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the descendant connexion</b></font>)</div><p/>But whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) ever tried or no, lay hidden in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) own closed heart. and retired, overwhelmed with grief. Mr. Bounderby had not been long gone, when Bitzer appeared.
<p/>Bitzer had come down by train, shrieking and rattling over the long line of arches that bestrode the wild country of past and present coal- pits, with an express from Stone Lodge.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had never been well within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) daughter's knowledge; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had declined within the last few days, had continued sinking all through the night, and was now as nearly dead, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) limited capacity of being in any state that implied the ghost of an intention to get out of it, allowed.
<p/>Accompanied by the lightest of porters, fit colourless servitor at Death's door when Mrs. Gradgrind knocked, Louisa rumbled to Coketown, over the coal-pits past and present, and was whirled into its smoky jaws.
<p/>It was a hasty note to inform Louisa that Mrs. Gradgrind lay very ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) dismissed the messenger to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) own devices, and rode away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) old home.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) father was usually sifting and sifting at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) parliamentary cinder-heap in London -LRB-without being observed to turn up many precious articles among the rubbish-RRB-, and was still hard at it in the national dust- yard.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) mother had taken it rather as a disturbance than otherwise, to be visited, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) reclined upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) sofa; young people, Louisa felt herself all unfit for;
<p/>Sissy she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had never softened to again, since the night when the stroller's child had raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes to look at Mr. Bounderby's intended wife.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had seldom been there since her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) marriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had no inducements to go back, and had rarely gone. Neither, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) old home now, did any of the best influences of old home descend upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>).
<p/>The dreams of childhood - its airy fables; its graceful, beautiful, humane, impossible adornments of the world beyond: so good to be believed in once, so good to be remembered when outgrown, for then the least among them rises to the stature of a great Charity in the heart, suffering little children to come into the midst of it, and to keep with their pure hands a garden in the stony ways of this world, wherein it were better for all the children of Adam that they should oftener sun themselves, simple and trustful, and not worldly-wise - what had she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to do with these?
<p/>Remembrances of how she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had journeyed to the little that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) knew, by the enchanted roads of what she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) and millions of innocent creatures had hoped and imagined; of how, first coming upon Reason through the tender light of Fancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had seen it a beneficent god, deferring to gods as great as itself; not a grim Idol, cruel and cold, with its victims bound hand to foot, and its big dumb shape set up with a sightless stare, never to be moved by anything
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) remembrances of home and childhood were remembrances of the drying up of every spring and fountain in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) young heart as it gushed out.
<p/>but so many calculated tons of leverage - what had she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to do with these? The golden waters were not there.
<p/>They were flowing for the fertilization of the land where grapes are gathered from thorns, and figs from thistles. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) went, with a heavy, hardened kind of sorrow upon her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), into the house and into her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mother's room.
<p/>Since the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) leaving home, Sissy had lived with the rest of the family on equal terms. Sissy was at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) mother's side; and Jane, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister, now ten or twelve years old, was in the room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) reclined, propped up, from mere habit, on a couch: as nearly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) old usual attitude, as anything so helpless could be kept in.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had positively refused to take to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) bed; on the ground that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would never hear the last of it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feeble voice sounded so far away in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) bundle of shawls, and the sound of another voice addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) seemed to take such a long time in getting down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ears, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might have been lying at the bottom of a well.
<p/>There was great trouble before it could be made known to Mrs. Gradgrind that her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) eldest child was there. The poor lady was nearer Truth than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) ever had been: which had much to do with it.
<p/>On being told that Mrs. Bounderby was there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) replied, at cross- purposes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had never called him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) by that name since he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) married Louisa; that pending her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) choice of an objectionable name, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) J; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could not at present depart from that regulation, not being yet provided with a permanent substitute.
<p/>Louisa had sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) for some minutes, and had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) often, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) arrived at a clear understanding who it was.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) then seemed to come to it all at once. <div class="bookquote">` Well, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`and I hope you are going on satisfactorily to yourself.
<p/>It was all your father's doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart upon it. And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) ought to know.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I want to hear of you, mother; not of myself.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You want to hear of me, my dear? That's something new , I am sure, when anybody wants to hear of me.
<p/>I think there's a pain somewhere in the room,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`but I couldn't positively say that I have got it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Not at all well, Louisa. Very faint and giddy.' <div class="bookquote">`Are you in pain, dear mother?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>` After this strange speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lay silent for some time.
<p/>Louisa, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hand, could feel no pulse; but kissing it, could see a slight thin thread of life in fluttering motion. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You very seldom see your sister,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) grows like you. I wish you would look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>).
<p/>Sissy, bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) here.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) was brought, and stood with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) sister's. Louisa had observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) arm
<p/>round Sissy's neck, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) felt the difference of this approach. <div class="bookquote">` Do you see the likeness, Louisa?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>` Yes, mother.
<p/>I should think her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) like me. But - ` <div class="bookquote">`Eh! Yes, I always say so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Gradgrind cried, with unexpected quickness. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And that reminds me. I - I want to speak to you, my dear. Sissy, my good girl, leave us alone a minute.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Louisa had relinquished the hand: had thought that her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sister's was a better and brighter face than hers had ever been: had seen in it, not without a rising feeling of resentment, even in that place and at that time, something of the gentleness of the other face in the room; the sweet face with the trusting eyes, made paler than watching and sympathy made it, by the rich dark hair.
<p/>Left alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) mother, Louisa saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) lying with an awful lull upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face, like one who was floating away upon some great water, all resistance over, content to be carried down the stream.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) put the shadow of a hand to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) lips again, and recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` You were going to speak to me, mother.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Eh? Yes, to be sure, my dear. You know your father is almost always away now, and therefore I must write to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) about it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>About what?' <div class="bookquote">`You must remember, my dear, that whenever I have said anything, on any subject, I have never heard the last of it: and consequently, that I have long left off saying anything.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I can hear you, mother.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>But, it was only by dint of bending down to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ear, and at the same time attentively watching the lips as they moved, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could link such faint and broken sounds into any chain of connexion. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` About what, mother? Don't be troubled. You learnt a great deal, Louisa, and so did your brother. Ologies of all kinds from morning to night.
<p/>If there is any Ology left, of any description, that has not been worn to rags in this house, all I can say is, I hope I shall never hear its name.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I can hear you, mother, when you have strength to go on.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) from floating away. <div class="bookquote">` But there is something - not an Ology at all - that your father has missed, or forgotten, Louisa.
<p/>I don't know what it is. I have often sat with Sissy near me, and thought about it. I shall never get its name now.
<p/>But your father may. It makes me restless. I want to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), to find out for God's sake, what it is.
<p/>Give me a pen, give me a pen.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Even the power of restlessness was gone, except from the poor head, which could just turn from side to side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) fancied, however, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) request had been complied with, and that the pen she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) could not have held was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) hand.
<p/>The hand soon stopped in the midst of them; the light that had always been feeble and dim behind the weak transparency, went out; and even Mrs. Gradgrind, emerged from the shadow in which man walketh and disquieteth himself in vain, took upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) the dread solemnity of the sages and patriarchs.
<p/>It matters little what figures of wonderful no-meaning she (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) began to trace upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) wrappers. CHAPTER X - MRS. SPARSIT'S STAIRCASE MRS.
<p/>SPARSIT'S nerves being slow to recover their tone, the worthy woman made a stay of some weeks in duration at Mr. Bounderby's retreat, where, notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anchorite turn of mind based upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) becoming consciousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) altered station, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resigned herself with noble fortitude to lodging, as one may say, in clover, and feeding on the fat of the land.
<p/>During the whole term of this recess from the guardianship of the Bank, Mrs. Sparsit was a pattern of consistency; continuing to take such pity on Mr. Bounderby to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) face, as is rarely taken on man, and to call his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) portrait a Noodle to its face, with the greatest acrimony and contempt.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby, having got it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) explosive composition that Mrs. Sparsit was a highly superior woman to perceive that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had that general cross upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) deserts -LRB-for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had not yet settled what it was-RRB-, and further that Louisa would have objected to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) as a frequent visitor if it had comported with his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) greatness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) should object to anything he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) chose to do, resolved not to lose sight of Mrs. Sparsit easily.
<p/>So when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) nerves were strung up to the pitch of again consuming sweetbreads in solitude, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) at the dinner-table, on the day before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) departure, <div class="bookquote">`I tell you what, ma'am; you shall come down here of a Saturday, while the fine weather lasts, and stay till Monday.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Now, Mrs. Sparsit was not a poetical woman; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) took an idea in the nature of an allegorical fancy, into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head.
<p/>Much watching of Louisa, and much consequent observation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) impenetrable demeanour, which keenly whetted and sharpened Mrs. Sparsit's edge, must have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) as it were a lift, in the way of inspiration.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) erected in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mind a mighty Staircase, with a dark pit of shame and ruin at the bottom; and down those stairs, from day to day and hour to hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) saw Louisa coming.
<p/>To which Mrs. Sparsit returned, in effect, though not of the Mahomedan persuasion: <div class="bookquote">`To hear is to obey.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>It became the business of Mrs. Sparsit's life, to look up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) staircase, and to watch Louisa coming down.
<p/>Sometimes slowly, sometimes quickly, sometimes several steps at one bout, sometimes stopping, never turning back. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had once turned back, it might have been the death of Mrs. Sparsit in spleen and grief.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had been descending steadily, to the day, and on the day, when Mr. Bounderby issued the weekly invitation recorded above.
<p/>And pray, sir,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), `if I may venture to ask a question appertaining to any subject on which you show reserve - which is indeed hardy in me,
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit was in good spirits, and inclined to be conversational. <div class="bookquote">` for I well know you have a reason for everything you do - have you received intelligence respecting the robbery?'
 (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, ma'am, no; not yet. Under the circumstances, I didn't expect it yet. Rome wasn't built in a day, ma'am.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Very true, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nor yet in a week, ma'am.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, with a gentle melancholy upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` In a similar manner, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`I can wait, you know.
<p/>If Romulus and Remus could wait, Josiah Bounderby can wait. They were better off in their youth than I was, however.
<p/>They had a she-wolf for a nurse; I had only a she-wolf for a grandmother. She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) didn't give any milk, ma'am; she (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) gave bruises.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>grandmother</b></font>) was a regular Alderney at that.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Ah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sparsit sighed and shuddered. <div class="bookquote">` No, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>continued Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`I have not heard anything more about it.
<p/>It's in hand, though; and young Tom, who rather sticks to business at present - something new for him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) hadn't the schooling I had - is helping.
<p/>Do what you like under the rose, but don't give a sign of what you're about; or half a hundred of 'em will combine together and get this fellow who has bolted, out of reach for good.
<p/>My injunction is, Keep it quiet, and let it seem to blow over. Keep it quiet, and the thieves will grow in confidence by little and little, and we shall have 'em.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>The old woman you mentioned, sir - ` <div class="bookquote">`The old woman I mentioned, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>The woman woman</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, cutting the matter short, as it was nothing to boast about, <div class="bookquote">`is not laid hold of;
<p/>Very sagacious indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` Very interesting. but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) may take her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) oath she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) will be, if that is any satisfaction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) villainous old mind.
<p/>In the mean time, ma'am, I am of opinion, if you ask me my opinion, that the less she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) is talked about, the better.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>The same evening, Mrs. Sparsit, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) chamber window, resting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) packing operations, looked towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) great staircase and saw Louisa still descending.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sat by Mr. Harthouse, in an alcove in the garden, talking very low; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) stood leaning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), as they whispered together, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) face almost touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hair. `
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit was too distant to hear a word of their discourse, or even to know that they were speaking softly, otherwise than from the expression of their figures; but what they said was this: <div class="bookquote">`You recollect the man, Mr. Harthouse?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>If not quite!' said Mrs. Sparsit, straining her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) hawk's eyes to the utmost. <div class="bookquote">` Oh, perfectly!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` His (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) face, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) manner, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) said?'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Perfectly. And an infinitely dreary person he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) appeared to me to be. Lengthy and prosy in the extreme. It was knowing to hold forth, in the humble-virtue school of eloquence; but, I assure you
<p/>I thought at the time, ``My good fellow, you are over-doing this!'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`It has been very difficult to me to think ill of that man.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` My dear Louisa - as Tom says.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) never did say. <div class="bookquote">` You know no good of the fellow?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Nor of any other such person?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`How can I,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) returned, with more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) first manner on her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had lately seen, <div class="bookquote">`when I know nothing of them, men or women?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear Louisa, then consent to receive the submissive representation of your devoted friend, who knows something of several varieties of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) excellent fellow-creatures - for excellent they are, I am quite ready to believe, in spite of such little foibles as always helping themselves to what they can get hold of.
<p/>From the House of Commons to the House of Correction, there is a general profession of morality, except among our people; it really is that exception which makes our people quite reviving.
<p/>No, certainly.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>` This fellow talks. Well; every fellow talks. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) professes morality. Well; all sorts of humbugs profess morality. You saw and heard the case.
<p/>Here was one of the fluffy classes pulled up extremely short by my esteemed friend Mr. Bounderby - who, as we know, is not possessed of that delicacy which would soften so tight a hand.
<p/>The member of the fluffy classes was injured, exasperated, left the house grumbling, met somebody who proposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) to go in for some share in this Bank business, went in, put something in his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) pocket which had nothing in it before, and relieved his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) mind extremely.
<p/>Really he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) would have been an uncommon, instead of a common, fellow, if he (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) had not availed himself of such an opportunity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I almost feel as though it must be bad in me,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>returned Louisa, after sitting thoughtful awhile, <div class="bookquote">`to be so ready to agree with you, and to be so lightened in my heart by what you say.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><p/>I have talked it over with my friend Tom more than once - of course I remain on terms of perfect confidence with Tom - and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is quite of my opinion, and I am quite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>Or he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) may have originated it altogether, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had the cleverness.' <div class="bookquote">`I only say what is reasonable; nothing worse. Will you walk?'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They strolled away, among the lanes beginning to be indistinct in the twilight - she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) arm - and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) little thought how she (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was going down, down, down, Mrs. Sparsit's staircase.
<p/>When Louisa had arrived at the bottom and disappeared in the gulf, it might fall in upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) if it would; but, until then, there it was to be, a Building, before Mrs. Sparsit's eyes.
<p/>Night and day, Mrs. Sparsit kept it standing. And there Louisa always was, upon it. And always gliding down, down, down!
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit saw James Harthouse come and go; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) here and there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) saw the changes of the face he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had studied; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), too, remarked to a nicety how and when it clouded, how and when it cleared; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) black eyes wide open, with no touch of pity, with no touch of compunction, all absorbed in interest.
<p/>In the interest of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), ever drawing, with no hand to stay her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), nearer and nearer to the bottom of this new Giant's Staircase.
<p/>With all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) deference for Mr. Bounderby as contradistinguished from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) portrait, Mrs. Sparsit had not the smallest intention of interrupting the descent.
<p/>Eager to see it accomplished, and yet patient, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) waited for the last fall, as for the ripeness and fulness of the harvest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) hopes.
<p/>Hushed in expectancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) wary gaze upon the stairs; and seldom so much as darkly shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) right mitten -LRB-with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) fist in it-RRB-, at the figure coming down.
<p/>THE figure descended the great stairs, steadily, steadily; always verging, like a weight in deep water, to the black gulf at the bottom.
<p/>CHAPTER XI - LOWER AND LOWER Mr. Gradgrind, apprised of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) wife's decease, made an expedition from London, and buried her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in a business-like manner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) then returned with promptitude to the national cinder-heap, and resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) sifting for the odds and ends he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) wanted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) throwing of the dust about into the eyes of other people who wanted other odds and ends - in fact resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) parliamentary duties.
<p/>Separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) staircase, all the week, by the length of iron road dividing Coketown from the country house, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) yet maintained her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cat-like observation of Louisa, through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband, through her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother, through James Harthouse, through the outsides of letters and packets, through everything animate and inanimate that at any time went near the stairs. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your foot on the last step, my lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, apostrophizing the descending figure, with the aid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) threatening mitten, <div class="bookquote">`and all your art shall never blind me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Art or nature though, the original stock of Louisa's character or the graft of circumstances upon it, - her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) curious reserve did baffle, while it stimulated, one as sagacious as Mrs. Sparsit.
<p/>In the meantime, Mrs. Sparsit kept unwinking watch and ward. There were times when Mr. James Harthouse was not sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>).
<p/>There were times when he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) could not read the face he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had studied so long; and when this lonely girl was a greater mystery to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), than any woman of the world with a ring of satellites to help her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>So the time went on; until it happened that Mr. Bounderby was called away from home by business which required his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) presence elsewhere, for three or four days.
<p/>It was on a Friday that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) intimated this to Mrs. Sparsit at the Bank, adding: <div class="bookquote">` But you'll go down to-morrow, ma'am, all the same.
<p/>You'll go down just as if I was there. It will make no difference to you.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bank</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Pray, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, reproachfully, <div class="bookquote">`let me beg you not to say that.
<p/>Well, ma'am, then you must get on in my absence as well as you can,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, not displeased. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Mr. Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>retorted Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`your will is to me a law, sir; otherwise, it might be my inclination to dispute your kind commands, not feeling sure that it will be quite so agreeable to Miss Gradgrind to receive me, as it ever is to your own munificent hospitality.
<p/>Your absence will make a vast difference to me, sir, as I think you very well know.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>` But you shall say no more, sir.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Why, when I invite you to my house, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) eyes, <div class="bookquote">`I should hope you want no other invitation.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>I will go, upon your invitation.' <div class="bookquote">` No, indeed, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`I should hope not. Say no more, sir.
<p/>I would, sir, I could see you gay again.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What do you mean, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>blustered Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` Sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Sparsit, `there was wont to be an elasticity in you which I sadly miss.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby, under the influence of this difficult adjuration, backed up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) compassionate eye, could only scratch his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) head in a feeble and ridiculous manner, and afterwards assert himself at a distance, by being heard to bully the small fry of business all the morning. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bitzer,'  (<font color='red'><b>bully</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit that afternoon, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) patron was gone on his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) journey, and the Bank was closing, <div class="bookquote">`present my compliments to young Mr. Thomas, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would step up and partake of a lamb chop and walnut ketchup, with a glass of India ale?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Bank</b></font>)</div><p/>Young Mr. Thomas being usually ready for anything in that way, returned a gracious answer, and followed on its heels. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Be buoyant, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Mr. Thomas,' said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`these plain viands being on table, I thought you might be tempted.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thank`ee, Mrs. Sparsit,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said the whelp. And gloomily fell to. <div class="bookquote">` How is Mr. Harthouse, Mr. Tom?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Sparsit. `
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit asked in a light conversational manner, after mentally devoting the whelp to the Furies for being so uncommunicative. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>)'s all right,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Furies</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">` Where may he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) be at present?'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is shooting in Yorkshire,' said Tom. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Sent Loo a basket half as big as a church, yesterday.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` The kind of gentleman, now,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, sweetly, <div class="bookquote">`whom one might wager to be a good shot!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had long been a down-looking young fellow, but this characteristic had so increased of late, that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) never raised his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eyes to any face for three seconds together.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Crack,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom. Mrs. Sparsit consequently had ample means of watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) looks, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) were so inclined. <div class="bookquote">` Mr. Harthouse is a great favourite of mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`as indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) is of most people.
<p/>May we expect to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) again shortly, Mr. Tom?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why, I expect to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to-morrow,'  (<font color='red'><b>the whelp</b></font>)</div>returned the whelp. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Good news!'  (<font color='red'><b>the whelp</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Sparsit, blandly. <div class="bookquote">` I have got an appointment with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) in the evening at the station here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Tom, <div class="bookquote">`and
<p/>I am going to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) afterwards, I believe. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is not coming down to the country house for a week or so, being due somewhere else.
<p/>At least, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) says so; but I shouldn't wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was to stop here over Sunday, and stray that way.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Which reminds me!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Would you remember a message to your sister, Mr. Tom, if I was to charge you with one?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well? I'll try,'  (<font color='red'><b>the whelp</b></font>)</div>returned the reluctant whelp, <div class="bookquote">`if it isn't a long un.'  (<font color='red'><b>the whelp</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is merely my respectful compliments,'  (<font color='red'><b>the whelp</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`and I fear I may not trouble her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) with my society this week; being still a little nervous, and better perhaps by my poor self.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Oh! If that's all,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>observed Tom, <div class="bookquote">`it wouldn't much matter, even if I was to forget it, for Loo's not likely to think of you unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) sees you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Having paid for his (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) entertainment with this agreeable compliment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) relapsed into a hangdog silence until there was no more India ale left, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Loo</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`Well, Mrs. Sparsit, I must be off!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and went off.
<p/>Next day, Saturday, Mrs. Sparsit sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) window all day long looking at the customers coming in and out, watching the postmen, keeping an eye on the general traffic of the street, revolving many things in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mind, but, above all, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) attention on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) staircase.
<p/>The evening come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) bonnet and shawl, and went quietly out: having her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) reasons for hovering in a furtive way about the station by which a passenger would arrive from Yorkshire, and for preferring to peep into it round pillars and corners, and out of ladies' waiting-room windows, to appearing in its precincts openly.
<p/>Tom waited until the crowd had dispersed, and the bustle was over; and then referred to a posted list of trains, and took counsel with porters.
<p/>That done, he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) strolled away idly, stopping in the street and looking up it and down it, and lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) hat off and putting it on again, and yawning and stretching himself, and exhibiting all the symptoms of mortal weariness to be expected in one who had still to wait until the next train should come in, an hour and forty minutes hence. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is a device to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) out of the way,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, starting from the dull office window whence she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had watched him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) last. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Tom was in attendance, and loitered about until the expected train came in. It brought no Mr. Harthouse. Harthouse is with his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) sister now!'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The station for the country house was at the opposite end of the town, the time was short, the road not easy; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was so quick in pouncing on a disengaged coach, so quick in darting out of it, producing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) money, seizing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ticket, and diving into the train, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was borne along the arches spanning the land of coal-pits past and present, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been caught up in a cloud and whirled away.
<p/>All the journey, immovable in the air though never left behind; plain to the dark eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mind, as the electric wires which ruled a colossal strip of music-paper out of the evening sky, were plain to the dark eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) body; Mrs. Sparsit saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) staircase, with the figure coming down.
<p/>It was the conception of an inspired moment, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) shot off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) utmost swiftness to work it out. Very near the bottom now.
<p/>An overcast September evening, just at nightfall, saw beneath its drooping eyelids Mrs. Sparsit glide out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) carriage, pass down the wooden steps of the little station into a stony road, cross it into a green lane, and become hidden in a summer-growth of leaves and branches.
<p/>One or two late birds sleepily chirping in their nests, and a bat heavily crossing and recrossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), and the reek of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) own tread in the thick dust that felt like velvet, were all Mrs. Sparsit heard or saw until she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) very softly closed a gate.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) went up to the house, keeping within the shrubbery, and went round it, peeping between the leaves at the lower windows.
<p/>Most of them were open, as they usually were in such warm weather, but there were no lights yet, and all was silent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) thought of the wood, and stole towards it, heedless of long grass and briers: of worms, snails, and slugs, and all the creeping things that be.
<p/>With her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) dark eyes and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) hook nose warily in advance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), Mrs. Sparsit softly crushed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) way through the thick undergrowth, so intent upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) object that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) probably would have done no less, if the wood had been a wood of adders.
<p/>The smaller birds might have tumbled out of their nests, fascinated by the glittering of Mrs. Sparsit's eyes in the gloom, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) stopped and listened.
<p/>Upon the brink of the abyss. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) tried the garden with no better effect. Hark! Low voices close at hand. His (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) voice and hers.
<p/>The appointment was a device to keep the brother away! There they were yonder, by the felled tree. Bending low among the dewy grass, Mrs. Sparsit advanced closer to them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) drew herself up, and stood behind a tree, like Robinson Crusoe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) ambuscade against the savages; so near to them that at a spring, and that no great one, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) could have touched them both.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) had come on horseback, and must have passed through the neighbouring fields; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) horse was tied to the meadow side of the fence, within a few paces. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) was there secretly, and had not shown himself at the house. My dearest love,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`what could I do?
<p/>You may hang your head, to make yourself the more attractive; I don't know what they see in you when you hold it up,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>thought Mrs. Sparsit; <div class="bookquote">`but you little think, my dearest love, whose eyes are on you!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) to go away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) commanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) to go away; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) neither turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) face to him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>), nor raised it.
<p/>Knowing you were alone, was it possible that I could stay away?' ` That she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) hung her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head, was certain. Yet it was remarkable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) sat as still as ever
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) hands rested in one another, like the hands of a statue; and even her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) manner of speaking was not hurried. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear child,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Harthouse; Mrs. Sparsit saw with delight that his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) arm embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">`will you not bear with my society for a little while?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>the amiable woman in ambuscade had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sit, at any period in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life. Not here.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>`Where, Louisa? <div class="bookquote">` Not here.'

<p/>To look for your sunny welcome that has warmed me into life, and to be received in your frozen manner, is heart-rending.'
<p/>` There never was a slave at once so devoted and ill-used by his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) mistress. <div class="bookquote">`Am I to say again, that I must be left to myself here?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But we must meet, my dear Louisa. Where shall we meet?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They both started. The listener started, guiltily, too; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) thought there was another listener among the trees.
<p/>Shall I ride up to the house a few minutes hence, innocently supposing that its master is at home and will be charmed to receive me?' `
<p/>Your cruel commands are implicitly to be obeyed; though I am the most unfortunate fellow in the world, I believe, to have been insensible to all other women, and to have fallen prostrate at last under the foot of the most beautiful, and the most engaging, and the most imperious.
<p/>It was only rain, beginning to fall fast, in heavy drops. <div class="bookquote">` No!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` My dearest Louisa, I cannot go myself, or let you go, in this hard abuse of your power.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sparsit saw him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) encircling arm, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) then and there, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) -LRB-Mrs. Sparsit's-RRB- greedy hearing, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was the stake for which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ardently desired to play away all that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had in life.
<p/>The objects he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had lately pursued, turned worthless beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>); such success as was almost in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) grasp, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) flung away from him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) like the dirt it was, compared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>).
<p/>Its pursuit, nevertheless, if it kept him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) near her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), or its renunciation if it took him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), or flight if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) shared it, or secrecy if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) commanded it, or any fate, or every fate, all was alike to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was true to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), - the man who had seen how cast away she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had inspired at their first meeting with an admiration, an interest, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had thought himself incapable, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had received into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) confidence, who was devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) and adored her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>).
<p/>All this, and more, in his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hurry, and in hers, in the whirl of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) own gratified malice, in the dread of being discovered, in the rapidly increasing noise of heavy rain among the leaves, and a thunderstorm rolling up - Mrs. Sparsit received into her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mind, set off with such an unavoidable halo of confusion and indistinctness, that when at length he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) climbed the fence and led his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) horse away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was not sure where they were to meet, or when, except that they had said it was to be that night.
<p/>But one of them yet remained in the darkness before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>); and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) tracked that one she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) must be right. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, my dearest love,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">` you little think how well attended you are!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sparsit saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) out of the wood, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) enter the house.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit's white stockings were of many colours, green predominating; prickly things were in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) shoes; caterpillars slung themselves, in hammocks of their own making, from various parts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) dress; rills ran from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) bonnet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) Roman nose.
<p/>What to do next? It rained now, in a sheet of water. In such condition, Mrs. Sparsit stood hidden in the density of the shrubbery, considering what next?
<p/>Lo, Louisa coming out of the house! Hastily cloaked and muffled, and stealing away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) elopes! She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) falls from the lowermost stair, and is swallowed up in the gulf.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit followed in the shadow of the trees, at but a short distance; for it was not easy to keep a figure in view going quickly through the umbrageous darkness.
<p/>Indifferent to the rain, and moving with a quick determined step, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) struck into a side-path parallel with the ride. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) stopped to close the side-gate without noise, Mrs. Sparsit stopped.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) went by the way Mrs. Sparsit had come, emerged from the green lane, crossed the stony road, and ascended the wooden steps to the railroad.
<p/>A train for Coketown would come through presently, Mrs. Sparsit knew; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) understood Coketown to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) first place of destination.
<p/>In Mrs. Sparsit's limp and streaming state, no extensive precautions were necessary to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) usual appearance; but, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) stopped under the lee of the station wall, tumbled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) shawl into a new shape, and put it on over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) bonnet.
<p/>So disguised she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had no fear of being recognized when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) followed up the railroad steps, and paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) money in the small office.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) went on, Mrs. Sparsit went on. Louisa sat waiting in a corner. Mrs. Sparsit sat waiting in another corner.
<p/>Both listened to the thunder, which was loud, and to the rain, as it washed off the roof, and pattered on the parapets of the arches.
<p/>Two or three lamps were rained out and blown out; so, both saw the lightning to advantage as it quivered and zigzagged on the iron tracks.
<p/>The seizure of the station with a fit of trembling, gradually deepening to a complaint of the heart, announced the train.
<p/>Fire and steam, and smoke, and red light; a hiss, a crash, a bell, and a shriek; Louisa put into one carriage, Mrs. Sparsit put into another:
<p/>the little station a desert speck in the thunderstorm. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) teeth chattered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) head from wet and cold, Mrs. Sparsit exulted hugely.
<p/>The figure had plunged down the precipice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) felt herself, as it were, attending on the body. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), who had been so active in the getting up of the funeral triumph, do less than exult? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) will be at Coketown long before him (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`though his (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) horse is never so good. Where will she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) wait for him (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>)?
<p/>And where will they go together? Patience. We shall see.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>The tremendous rain occasioned infinite confusion, when the train stopped at its destination.
<p/>In the first instant of alighting, Mrs. Sparsit turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) distracted eyes towards the waiting coaches, which were in great request. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Gutters and pipes had burst, drains had overflowed, and streets were under water. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) will get into one,'  (<font color='red'><b>the coaches</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) considered, <div class="bookquote">`and will be away before I can follow in another.
<p/>At all risks of being run over, I must see the number, and hear the order given to the coachman.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But, Mrs. Sparsit was wrong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) calculation.
<p/>Louisa got into no coach, and was already gone. The black eyes kept upon the railroad-carriage in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had travelled, settled upon it a moment too late.
<p/>The door not being opened after several minutes, Mrs. Sparsit passed it and repassed it, saw nothing, looked in, and found it empty.
<p/>Wet through and through: with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) feet squelching and squashing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) shoes whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) moved; with a rash of rain upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) classical visage; with a bonnet like an over-ripe fig; with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) clothes spoiled; with damp impressions of every button, string, and hook-and-eye she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) wore, printed off upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) highly connected back; with a stagnant verdure on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) general exterior, such as accumulates on an old park fence in a mouldy lane; Mrs. Sparsit had no resource but to burst into tears of bitterness and say, <div class="bookquote">`I have lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>)!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER XII - DOWN THE national dustmen, after entertaining one another with a great many noisy little fights among themselves, had dispersed for the present, and Mr. Gradgrind was at home for the vacation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) sat writing in the room with the deadly statistical clock, proving something no doubt - probably, in the main, that the Good Samaritan was a Bad Economist.
<p/>The noise of the rain did not disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) much; but it attracted his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) attention sufficiently to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) head sometimes, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) were rather remonstrating with the elements.
<p/>When it thundered very loudly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) glanced towards Coketown, having it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) mind that some of the tall chimneys might be struck by lightning.
<p/>The thunder was rolling into distance, and the rain was pouring down like a deluge, when the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) room opened.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) looked round the lamp upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) table, and saw, with amazement, his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) eldest daughter. <div class="bookquote">` Louisa!'  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Father, I want to speak to you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` What is the matter? How strange you look! And good Heaven,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, wondering more and more, <div class="bookquote">`have you come here exposed to this storm?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) uncovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head, and letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) cloak and hood fall where they might, stood looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>): so colourless, so dishevelled, so defiant and despairing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). `
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hands to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) dress, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hardly knew. <div class="bookquote">` Yes.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>What is it? I conjure you, Louisa, tell me what is the matter.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) dropped into a chair before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), and put her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) cold hand on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) arm. <div class="bookquote">` Father, you have trained me from my cradle?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Yes, Louisa.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I curse the hour in which I was born to such a destiny.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in doubt and dread, vacantly repeating: `Curse the hour?
<p/><div class="bookquote">`How could you give me life, and take from me all the inappreciable things that raise it from the state of conscious death?
<p/>What have you done, O father, what have you done, with the garden that should have bloomed once, in this great wilderness here!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Curse the hour?' Where are the graces of my soul? Where are the sentiments of my heart? She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) struck herself with both her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hands upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) bosom. `
<p/>If it had ever been here, its ashes alone would save me from the void in which my whole life sinks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been so wholly unprepared for what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heard now, that it was with difficulty he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">`Yes, Louisa.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What has risen to my lips now, would have risen to my lips then, if you had given me a moment's help.
<p/>I did not mean to say this; but, father, you remember the last time we conversed in this room?'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I don't reproach you, father.
<p/>What you have never nurtured in me, you have never nurtured in yourself; but O! if you had only done so long ago, or if you had only neglected me, what a much better and much happier creature I should have been this day!'
<p/>Father, if you had known, when we were last together here, what even I feared while I strove against it - as it has been my task from infancy to strive against every natural prompting that has arisen in my heart; if you had known that there lingered in my breast, sensibilities, affections, weaknesses capable of being cherished into strength, defying all the calculations ever made by man, and no more known to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arithmetic than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) Creator is, - would you have given me to the husband whom I am now sure that I hate?'
<p/>On hearing this, after all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) care, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand and groaned aloud. ` He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`No.
<p/>No, my poor child.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Would you have doomed me, at any time, to the frost and blight that have hardened and spoiled me?
<p/>Would you have robbed me - for no one's enrichment - only for the greater desolation of this world - of the immaterial part of my life, the spring and summer of my belief, my refuge from what is sordid and bad in the real things around me, my school in which I should have learned to be more humble and more trusting with them, and to hope in my little sphere to make them better?'
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>Yet, father, if I had been stone blind; if I had groped my way by my sense of touch, and had been free, while I knew the shapes and surfaces of things, to exercise my fancy somewhat, in regard to them; I should have been a million times wiser, happier, more loving, more contented, more innocent and human in all good respects, than I am with the eyes I have.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`O no, no. No, Louisa.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Now, hear what I have come to say.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) moved, to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) rising as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did so, they stood close together: she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), with a hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shoulder, looking fixedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>With a hunger and thirst upon me, father, which have never been for a moment appeased; with an ardent impulse towards some region where rules, and figures, and definitions were not quite absolute; I have grown up, battling every inch of my way.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I never knew you were unhappy, my child.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Father, I always knew it. In this strife I have almost repulsed and crushed my better angel into a demon.
<p/>What I have learned has left me doubting, misbelieving, despising, regretting, what I have not learned; and my dismal resource has been to think that life would soon go by, and that nothing in it could be worth the pain and trouble of a contest.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>In this condition, father - for I show you now, without fear or favour, the ordinary deadened state of my mind as I know it
<p/>And you so young, Louisa!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said with pity. ` And I so young. - you proposed my husband to me.
<p/>I took him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). I never made a pretence to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) or you that I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). I knew, and, father, you knew, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew, that I never did.
<p/>I was not wholly indifferent, for I had a hope of being pleasant and useful to Tom. I made that wild escape into something visionary, and have slowly found out how wild it was.
<p/>But Tom had been the subject of all the little tenderness of my life; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) became so because I knew so well how to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).
<p/>As her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father held her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms, she (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) other hand upon his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) other shoulder, and still looking fixedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, went on. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When I was irrevocably married, there rose up into rebellion against the tie, the old strife, made fiercer by all those causes of disparity which arise out of our two individual natures, and which no general laws shall ever rule or state for me, father, until they shall be able to direct the anatomist where to strike his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knife into the secrets of my soul.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

<p/>I do not reproach you, father, I make no complaint. I am here with another object.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What can I do, child?
<p/>Father, chance then threw into my way a new acquaintance; a man such as I had had no experience of; used to the world; light, polished, easy; making no pretences; avowing the low estimate of everything, that I was half afraid to form in secret; conveying to me almost immediately, though I don't know how or by what degrees, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) understood me, and read my thoughts.
<p/>Ask me what you will.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I am coming to it. I could not find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) was worse than I.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) father might instinctively have loosened his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hold, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) strength departing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>), and saw a wild dilating fire in the eyes steadfastly regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>There seemed to be a near affinity between us. For you, Louisa!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I say nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) plea for claiming my confidence.
<p/>It matters very little how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gained it. Father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) did gain it. What you know of the story of my marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) soon knew, just as well.'
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father's face was ashy white, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in both his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) arms. ` I have done no worse, I have not disgraced you.
<p/>But if you ask me whether I have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), or do love him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I tell you plainly, father, that it may be so.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hands suddenly from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shoulders, and pressed them both upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) side; while in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face, not like itself - and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) figure, drawn up, resolute to finish by a last effort what she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had to say - the feelings long suppressed broke loose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't know.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This night, my husband being away, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) has been with me, declaring himself my lover. This minute he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) expects me, for I could release myself of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) presence by no other means.
<p/>I do not know that I am sorry, I do not know that I am ashamed, I do not know that I am degraded in my own esteem.
<p/>All that I know is, your philosophy and your teaching will not save me. Now, father, you have brought me to this.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tightened his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hold in time to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) sinking on the floor, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) cried out in a terrible voice, `I shall die if you hold me!
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) laid her (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) down there, and saw the pride of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heart and the triumph of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) system, lying, an insensible heap, at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) feet.
<p/>THE THIRD - GARNERING CHAPTER I - ANOTHER THING NEEDFUL LOUISA awoke from a torpor, and her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) eyes languidly opened on her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) old bed at home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) old room.
<p/>It seemed, at first, as if all that had happened since the days when these objects were familiar to her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) were the shadows of a dream, but gradually, as the objects became more real to her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) sight, the events became more real to her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) mind.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) could scarcely move her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) head for pain and heaviness, her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) eyes were strained and sore, and she (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) was very weak.
<p/>A curious passive inattention had such possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>), that the presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) little sister in the room did not attract her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) notice for some time.
<p/>Even when their eyes had met, and her (<font color='blue'><b>LOUISA</b></font>) sister had approached the bed, Louisa lay for minutes looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in silence, and suffering her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) timidly to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) passive hand, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) asked: <div class="bookquote">`When was I brought to this room?'

(<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) young sister - timidly still - bent down to kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Have I? I am very glad you think so. I am sure it must be Sissy's doing.'  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>The arm Louisa had begun to twine around her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) neck, unbent itself. `
<p/>Then, staying her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) for a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`It was you who made my room so cheerful, and gave it this look of welcome?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You can tell father if you will.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Oh no, Louisa, it was done before I came. It was - ` Louisa turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) pillow, and heard no more.
<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sister had withdrawn, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head back again, and lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face towards the door, until it opened and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father entered.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat down at the side of the bed, tenderly asking how she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was, and dwelling on the necessity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) keeping very quiet after her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) agitation and exposure to the weather last night.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke in a subdued and troubled voice, very different from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) usual dictatorial manner; and was often at a loss for words. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had a jaded anxious look upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand, usually steady, trembled in hers. My dear Louisa. My poor daughter.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was so much at a loss at that place, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopped altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tried again. <div class="bookquote">` My unfortunate child.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>It would be hopeless for me, Louisa, to endeavour to tell you how overwhelmed I have been, and still am, by what broke upon me last night.
<p/>The place was so difficult to get over, that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tried again. <div class="bookquote">` The ground on which I stand has ceased to be solid under my feet.
<p/>The only support on which I leaned, and the strength of which it seemed, and still does seem, impossible to question, has given way in an instant.
<p/>I have no selfish meaning in what I say; but I find the shock of what broke upon me last night, to be very heavy indeed.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I am stunned by these discoveries. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) no comfort herein. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had suffered the wreck of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) whole life upon the rock. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I will not say, Louisa, that if you had by any happy chance undeceived me some time ago, it would have been better for us both; better for your peace, and better for mine.
<p/>For I am sensible that it may not have been a part of my system to invite any confidence of that kind.
<p/>I had proved my - my system to myself, and I have rigidly administered it; and I must bear the responsibility of its failures.
<p/>I only entreat you to believe, my favourite child, that I have meant to do right.'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) said it earnestly, and to do him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) justice he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had.
<p/>In gauging fathomless deeps with his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) little mean excise-rod, and in staggering over the universe with his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) rusty stiff-legged compasses, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had meant to do great things.
<p/>Within the limits of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) short tether he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) had tumbled about, annihilating the flowers of existence with greater singleness of purpose than many of the blatant personages whose company he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) kept. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am well assured of what you say, father. I know I have been your favourite child. I know you have intended to make me happy.
<p/>My dear, I have remained all night at my table, pondering again and again on what has so painfully passed between us.
<p/>When I consider your character; when I consider that what has been known to me for hours, has been concealed by you for years; when I consider under what immediate pressure it has been forced from you at last; I come to the conclusion that I cannot but mistrust myself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I have never blamed you, and I never shall.' He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) outstretched hand, and retained it in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). ` He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) might have added more than all, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) saw the face now looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
<p/>Such little actions, slight in another man, were very noticeable in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughter received them as if they had been words of contrition. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But,'  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, slowly, and with hesitation, as well as with a wretched sense of happiness, <div class="bookquote">`if I see reason to mistrust myself for the past, Louisa, I should also mistrust myself for the present and the future.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) did add it in effect, perhaps, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) softly moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) scattered hair from her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) forehead with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hand. To speak unreservedly to you, I do.
<p/>I am far from feeling convinced now, however differently I might have felt only this time yesterday, that I am fit for the trust you repose in me; that I know how to respond to the appeal you have come home to make to me; that I have the right instinct - supposing it for the moment to be some quality of that nature - how to help you, and to set you right, my child.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had turned upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) pillow, and lay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) arm, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) could not see it.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father was changed in nothing so much as in the respect that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have been glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in tears. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Some persons hold,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) pursued, still hesitating, `that there is a wisdom of the Head, and that there is a wisdom of the Heart.
<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) wildness and passion had subsided; but, though softened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was not in tears. I have not supposed so; but, as I have said, I mistrust myself now.
<p/>I have supposed the head to be all-sufficient. It may not be all- sufficient; how can I venture this morning to say it is!
<p/>If that other kind of wisdom should be what I have neglected, and should be the instinct that is wanted, Louisa - `
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) no answer, lying before him (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) bed, still half-dressed, much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) lying on the floor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) room last night. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Louisa,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and his (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hand rested on her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hair again, <div class="bookquote">`I have been absent from here, my dear, a good deal of late; and though your sister's training has been pursued according to - the system,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) appeared to come to that word with great reluctance always, <div class="bookquote">`it has necessarily been modified by daily associations begun, in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) case, at an early age.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) suggested it very doubtfully, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) were half unwilling to admit it even now. I ask you - ignorantly and humbly, my daughter - for the better, do you think?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Father,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) replied, without stirring, <div class="bookquote">`if any harmony has been awakened in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) young breast that was mute in mine until it turned to discord, let her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thank Heaven for it, and go upon her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) happier way, taking it as her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) greatest blessing that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has avoided my way.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`O my child, my child!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) said, in a forlorn manner, <div class="bookquote">`I am an unhappy man to see you thus! What avails it to me that you do not reproach me, if I so bitterly reproach myself!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Louisa, I have a misgiving that some change may have been slowly working about me in this house, by mere love and gratitude: that what the Head had left undone and could not do, the Heart may have been doing silently.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head, and spoke low to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Can it be so?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no reply. <div class="bookquote">` I am not too proud to believe it, Louisa.
<p/>How could I be arrogant, and you before me! Can it be so? Is it so, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) once more, lying cast away there; and without another word went out of the room.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been long gone, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) heard a light tread near the door, and knew that some one stood beside her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>).
<p/>A dull anger that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) should be seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) distress, and that the involuntary look she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had so resented should come to this fulfilment, smouldered within her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) like an unwholesome fire.
<p/>The air that would be healthful to the earth, the water that would enrich it, the heat that would ripen it, tear it when caged up.
<p/>So in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) bosom even now; the strongest qualities she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) possessed, long turned upon themselves, became a heap of obduracy, that rose against a friend.
<p/>It was well that soft touch came upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) neck, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) understood herself to be supposed to have fallen asleep.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) did not raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head. All closely imprisoned forces rend and destroy. The sympathetic hand did not claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) resentment.
<p/>Let it lie there, let it lie. It lay there, warming into life a crowd of gentler thoughts; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) rested.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) softened with the quiet, and the consciousness of being so watched, some tears made their way into her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>The face touched hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) knew that there were tears upon it too, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) the cause of them. As Louisa feigned to rouse herself, and sat up, Sissy retired, so that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) stood placidly near the bedside. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I hope I have not disturbed you. I have come to ask if you would let me stay with you?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why should you stay with me?
<p/>My sister will miss you. You are everything to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Am I?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>returned Sissy, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">` I would be something to you, if I might.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`What?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, almost sternly. <div class="bookquote">` Whatever you want most, if I could be that. At all events, I would like to try to be as near it as I can.
<p/>And however far off that may be, I will never tire of trying. Will you let me?'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` My father sent you to ask me.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me that I might come in now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sent me away from the room this morning - or at least - ` She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hesitated and stopped. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I thought it best myself that I should be sent away, for I felt very uncertain whether you would like to find me here.'
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>No indeed,' replied Sissy. <div class="bookquote">` At least, what?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) searching eyes upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). ` <div class="bookquote">`Have I always hated you so much?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I hope not, for I have always loved you, and have always wished that you should know it. But you changed to me a little, shortly before you left home.
<p/>You knew so much, and I knew so little, and it was so natural in many ways, going as you were among other friends, that I had nothing to complain of, and was not at all hurt.'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Not that I wondered at it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) colour rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) said it modestly and hurriedly. Louisa understood the loving pretence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) heart smote her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). `
<p/>Louisa, taking down the hand that would have embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) in another moment, held it in one of hers, and answered: <div class="bookquote">`First, Sissy, do you know what I am?
<p/>I am so proud and so hardened, so confused and troubled, so resentful and unjust to every one and to myself, that everything is stormy, dark, and wicked to me.
<p/>May I try?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Sissy, emboldened to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) hand to the neck that was insensibly drooping towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>). Does not that repel you?' <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am so unhappy, and all that should have made me otherwise is so laid waste, that if I had been bereft of sense to this hour, and instead of being as learned as you think me, had to begin to acquire the simplest truths, I could not want a guide to peace, contentment, honour, all the good of which I am quite devoid, more abjectly than I do.
<p/>In the innocence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) brave affection, and the brimming up of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) old devoted spirit, the once deserted girl shone like a beautiful light upon the darkness of the other.
<p/>No!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Does not that repel you?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No!'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>Louisa raised the hand that it might clasp her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) neck and join its fellow there.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) knees, and clinging to this stroller's child looked up at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) almost with veneration. <div class="bookquote">` Forgive me, pity me, help me!
<p/>Have compassion on my great need, and let me lay this head of mine upon a loving heart!'  (<font color='red'><b>stroller child</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`O lay it here!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><p/>JAMES HARTHOUSE passed a whole night and a day in a state of so much hurry, that the World, with its best glass in his (<font color='blue'><b>HARTHOUSE</b></font>) eye, would scarcely have recognized him (<font color='blue'><b>HARTHOUSE</b></font>) during that insane interval, as the brother Jem of the honourable and jocular member.
<p/>cried Sissy. <div class="bookquote">` Lay it here, my dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER II - VERY RIDICULOUS MR. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) was positively agitated. He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) several times spoke with an emphasis, similar to the vulgar manner.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) went in and went out in an unaccountable way, like a man without an object. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) rode like a highwayman.
<p/>In a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was so horribly bored by existing circumstances, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) forgot to go in for boredom in the manner prescribed by the authorities.
<p/>After putting his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse at Coketown through the storm, as if it were a leap, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) waited up all night: from time to time ringing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bell with the greatest fury, charging the porter who kept watch with delinquency in withholding letters or messages that could not fail to have been entrusted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and demanding restitution on the spot.
<p/>The dawn coming, the morning coming, and the day coming, and neither message nor letter coming with either, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went down to the country house.
<p/>Not even known to be gone until receipt of message, importing that her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) return was not to be expected for the present.
<p/>There, the report was, Mr. Bounderby away, and Mrs. Bounderby in town. Left for town suddenly last evening. In these circumstances he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had nothing for it but to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) to town.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) went to the house in town. Mrs. Bounderby not there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) looked in at the Bank. Mr. Bounderby away and Mrs. Sparsit away.
<p/>Mrs. Sparsit away? Who could have been reduced to sudden extremity for the company of that griffin! <div class="bookquote">` Well! I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own reasons for being uneasy about it. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was off somewhere at daybreak this morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>)'s always full of mystery; I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>). So I do that white chap; he (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>)'s always got his (<font color='blue'><b>chap</b></font>) blinking eyes upon a fellow.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Where were you last night, Tom?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Where was I last night!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Tom. <div class="bookquote">` Come! I like that. I was waiting for you, Mr. Harthouse, till it came down as I never saw it come down before.
<p/>Where was I too! Where were you, you mean.'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I was prevented from coming - detained.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Detained!'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>murmured Tom. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It would have been a pleasant job to go down by that on such a night, and have to walk home through a pond.
<p/>Two of us were detained. I was detained looking for you, till I lost every train but the mail. I was obliged to sleep in town after all.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Where?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Where? Why, in my own bed at Bounderby's.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Did you see your sister?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`How the deuce,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Tom, staring, <div class="bookquote">`could I see my sister when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was fifteen miles off?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Cursing these quick retorts of the young gentleman to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was so true a friend, Mr. Harthouse disembarrassed himself of that interview with the smallest conceivable amount of ceremony, and debated for the hundredth time what all this could mean?
<p/>It was, that whether she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was in town or out of town, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had been premature with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) who was so hard to comprehend, or she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had lost courage, or they were discovered, or some mischance or mistake, at present incomprehensible, had occurred, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) must remain to confront his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) fortune, whatever it was.
<p/>The hotel where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) was known to live when condemned to that region of blackness, was the stake to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) was tied.
<p/>So, whether I am waiting for a hostile message, or an assignation, or a penitent remonstrance, or an impromptu wrestle with my friend Bounderby in the Lancashire manner - which would seem as likely as anything else in the present state of affairs
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) made only one thing clear. As to all the rest - What will be, will be. <div class="bookquote">` - I'll dine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. James Harthouse. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bounderby has the advantage in point of weight; and if anything of a British nature is to come off between us, it may be as well to be in training.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Therefore he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) rang the bell, and tossing himself negligently on a sofa, ordered <div class="bookquote">`Some dinner at six - with a beefsteak in it,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and got through the intervening time as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) could.
<p/>That was not particularly well; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) remained in the greatest perplexity, and, as the hours went on, and no kind of explanation offered itself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) perplexity augmented at compound interest.
<p/>However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) took affairs as coolly as it was in human nature to do, and entertained himself with the facetious idea of the training more than once. `
<p/>At another time it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`Or a fellow of about thirteen or fourteen stone might be hired by the hour.'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But these jests did not tell materially on the afternoon, or his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) suspense; and, sooth to say, they both lagged fearfully.
<p/>It was impossible, even before dinner, to avoid often walking about in the pattern of the carpet, looking out of the window, listening at the door for footsteps, and occasionally becoming rather hot when any steps approached that room.
<p/>But, after dinner, when the day turned to twilight, and the twilight turned to night, and still no communication was made to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), it began to be as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) expressed it, <div class="bookquote">`like the Holy Office and slow torture.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>However, still true to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) conviction that indifference was the genuine high-breeding -LRB-the only conviction he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) seized this crisis as the opportunity for ordering candles and a newspaper.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had been trying in vain, for half an hour, to read this newspaper, when the waiter appeared and said, at once mysteriously and apologetically: <div class="bookquote">`Beg your pardon, sir.
<p/>It wouldn't be bad,'  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) yawned at one time, <div class="bookquote">`to give the waiter five shillings, and throw him (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You're wanted, sir, if you please.'
<p/>A general recollection that this was the kind of thing the Police said to the swell mob, caused Mr. Harthouse to ask the waiter in return, with bristling indignation, what the Devil he (<font color='blue'><b>Devil</b></font>) meant by <div class="bookquote">`wanted' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Where?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Outside this door, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>the waiter</b></font>)</div>Giving the waiter to the personage before mentioned, as a block- head duly qualified for that consignment, Mr. Harthouse hurried into the gallery.
<p/>Beg your pardon, sir. Young lady outside, sir, wishes to see you.' ` Outside? A young woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had never seen stood there.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) conducted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into the room and placed a chair for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) observed, by the light of the candles, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was even prettier than he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had at first believed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was not afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), or in any way disconcerted; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seemed to have her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind entirely preoccupied with the occasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) visit, and to have substituted that consideration for herself. <div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Harthouse drew a long breath; and, if ever man found himself in the position of not knowing what to say, made the discovery beyond all question that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) was so circumstanced.
<p/>The child-like ingenuousness with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) visitor spoke, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) modest fearlessness, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) truthfulness which put all artifice aside, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) entire forgetfulness of herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) earnest quiet holding to the object with which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had come; all this, together with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) reliance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) easily given promise - which in itself shamed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) - presented something in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) was so inexperienced, and against which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) knew any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) usual weapons would fall so powerless; that not a word could he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) rally to his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) relief.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">`So startling an announcement, so confidently made, and by such lips, is really disconcerting in the last degree.

<p/>The first object of my coming here, sir, is to assure you that you must believe that there is no more hope of your ever speaking with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) again, than there would be if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had died when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came home last night.'
 (<font color='red'><b>that lady</b></font>)</div><p/>But if I can't - or if I should, by infirmity of nature, be obstinate - and won't - ` `
<p/>` The drowning man catches at the straw. There is not the least hope. <div class="bookquote">`Must believe? It is still true. There is no hope.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><p/>James Harthouse looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with an incredulous smile upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) lips; but her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mind looked over and beyond him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), and the smile was quite thrown away.
<p/>If it should unhappily appear,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) said, `after due pains and duty on my part, that I am brought to a position so desolate as this banishment, I shall not become the lady's persecutor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) lip, and took a little time for consideration. <div class="bookquote">` Well! But you said you had no commission from her (<font color='blue'><b>persecutor</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>lip</b></font>)</div>`
<p/>I have no other trust, than that I have been with her (<font color='blue'><b>persecutor</b></font>) since she (<font color='blue'><b>persecutor</b></font>) came home, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>persecutor</b></font>) has given me her (<font color='blue'><b>persecutor</b></font>) confidence.
<p/>I have only the commission of my love for her (<font color='blue'><b>persecutor</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>persecutor</b></font>) love for me.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was touched in the cavity where his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) heart should have been - in that nest of addled eggs, where the birds of heaven would have lived if they had not been whistled away - by the fervour of this reproach. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I am not a moral sort of fellow,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`and I never make any pretensions to the character of a moral sort of fellow.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) said all this in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) frivolous way, the way seemed, for that once, a conscious polishing of but an ugly surface.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) was silent for a moment; and then proceeded with a more self-possessed air, though with traces of vexation and disappointment that would not be polished out. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>After what has been just now represented to me, in a manner I find it impossible to doubt - I know of hardly any other source from which I could have accepted it so readily -

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Harthouse/Mr. James Harthouse/James Harthouse</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) face, and walked about again. <div class="bookquote">` Upon my soul, I don't know what to say.

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>If I were to do such a very ridiculous thing,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) said, stopping again presently, and leaning against the chimney-piece, <div class="bookquote">`it could only be in the most inviolable confidence.'

<p/>Almost as soon as the ink was dry upon their superscriptions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had left the tall chimneys of Coketown behind, and was in a railway carriage, tearing and glaring over the dark landscape.
<p/>The moral sort of fellows might suppose that Mr. James Harthouse derived some comfortable reflections afterwards, from this prompt retreat, as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) few actions that made any amends for anything, and as a token to himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) had escaped the climax of a very bad business.
<p/>A secret sense of having failed and been ridiculous - a dread of what other fellows who went in for similar sorts of things, would say at his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) expense if they knew it - so oppressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), that what was about the very best passage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) life was the one of all others he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) would not have owned to on any account, and
<p/>CHAPTER III - VERY DECIDED THE indefatigable Mrs. Sparsit, with a violent cold upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) voice reduced to a whisper, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) stately frame so racked by continual sneezes that it seemed in danger of dismemberment, gave chase to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) patron until she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) in the metropolis; and there, majestically sweeping in upon him (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>patron</b></font>) hotel in St. James's Street, exploded the combustibles with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was charged, and blew up.
<p/>But it was not so, at all. the only one that made him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) ashamed of himself. Having executed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mission with infinite relish, this high-minded woman then fainted away on Mr. Bounderby's coat-collar.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby's first procedure was to shake Mrs. Sparsit off, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) to progress as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) might through various stages of suffering on the floor.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) next had recourse to the administration of potent restoratives, such as screwing the patient's thumbs, smiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) hands, abundantly watering her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) face, and inserting salt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mouth.
<p/>When these attentions had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) -LRB-which they speedily did-RRB-, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hustled her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) into a fast train without offering any other refreshment, and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) back to Coketown more dead than alive.
<p/>Regarded as a classical ruin, Mrs. Sparsit was an interesting spectacle on her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) arrival at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) journey's end; but considered in any other light, the amount of damage she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) had by that time sustained was excessive, and impaired her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) claims to admiration.
<p/>Utterly heedless of the wear and tear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) clothes and constitution, and adamant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) pathetic sneezes, Mr. Bounderby immediately crammed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) into a coach, and bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) off to Stone Lodge. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, Tom Gradgrind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stone Lodge</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, bursting into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) father-in- law's room late at night; <div class="bookquote">`here's a lady here - Mrs. Sparsit - you know Mrs. Sparsit - who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.'

BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, staring with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) might at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) so quiet and assuasive father-in-law, <div class="bookquote">`you know where your daughter is at the present time!'  (<font color='red'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You do? Undoubtedly. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) is here.'  (<font color='red'><b>father-in-law</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Here?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` My dear Bounderby, let me beg you to restrain these loud out- breaks, on all accounts.
<p/>The moment she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could detach herself from that interview with the person of whom you speak, and whom I deeply regret to have been the means of introducing to you, Louisa hurried here, for protection.
<p/>Louisa is here. I myself had not been at home many hours, when I received her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) - here, in this room.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hurried by the train to town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) ran from town to this house, through a raging storm, and presented herself before me in a state of distraction.
<p/>Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) has remained here ever since. Let me entreat you, for your own sake and for hers, to be more quiet.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bounderby silently gazed about him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) for some moments, in every direction except Mrs. Sparsit's direction; and then, abruptly turning upon the niece of Lady Scadgers, said to that wretched woman: <div class="bookquote">`Now, ma'am!
<p/>We shall be happy to hear any little apology you may think proper to offer, for going about the country at express pace, with no other luggage than a Cock-and-a-Bull, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>that woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>whispered Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`my nerves are at present too much shaken, and my health is at present too much impaired, in your service, to admit of my doing more than taking refuge in tears.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, ma'am,' said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`without making any observation to you that may not be made with propriety to a woman of good family, what I have got to add to that, is that there is something else in which it appears to me you may take refuge, namely, a coach.
<p/>And the coach in which we came here being at the door, you'll allow me to hand you down to it, and pack you home to the Bank: where the best course for you to pursue, will be to put your feet into the hottest water you can bear, and take a glass of scalding rum and butter after you get into bed.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>With these words, Mr. Bounderby extended his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) right hand to the weeping lady, and escorted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to the conveyance in question, shedding many plaintive sneezes by the way.
<p/>Now, as you showed me in your face, Tom Gradgrind, that you wanted to speak to me,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) resumed, `here I am.
<p/>But, I am not in a very agreeable state, I tell you plainly: not relishing this business, even as it is, and not considering that I am at any time as dutifully and submissively treated by your daughter, as Josiah Bounderby of Coketown ought to be treated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) wife.
<p/>-LRB-Which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) did.-RRB- ` He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) soon returned alone. <div class="bookquote">` You have your opinion, I dare say; and I have mine, I know.
<p/>If you mean to say anything to me to-night, that goes against this candid remark, you had better let it alone.'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gradgrind, it will be observed, being much softened, Mr. Bounderby took particular pains to harden himself at all points. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) amiable nature. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gradgrind began in reply. <div class="bookquote">` Now, you'll excuse me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`but I don't want to be too dear.
<p/>That, to start with. When I begin to be dear to a man, I generally find that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intention is to come over me.
<p/>I am not speaking to you politely; but, as you are aware, I am not polite. If you like politeness, you know where to get it.
<p/>You have your gentleman-friends, you know, and they'll serve you with as much of the article as you want. I don't keep it myself.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

<p/>and I should feel sensible of your delicacy, and grateful for it, if you would spare me these references to Harthouse.
<p/>I shall not associate him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) in our conversation with your intimacy and encouragement; pray do not persist in connecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) with mine.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I never mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) name!'

<p/>Perhaps I thought so. But, I say we are all liable to mistakes Well, well!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mr. Gradgrind, with a patient, even a submissive, air.
<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) sat for a little while pondering. <div class="bookquote">` Bounderby, I see reason to doubt whether we have ever quite understood Louisa.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`Let me say I, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) returned, in answer to the coarsely blurted question; <div class="bookquote">`I doubt whether I have understood Louisa.
<p/>I doubt whether I have been quite right in the manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) education.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`There you hit it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Bounderby. `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Who do you mean by We?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>There I agree with you. You have found it out at last, have you?
<p/>I'll tell you what education is - To be tumbled out of doors, neck and crop, and put upon the shortest allowance of everything except blows.
<p/>I think your good sense will perceive,' Mr. Gradgrind remonstrated in all humility, <div class="bookquote">`that whatever the merits of such a system may be, it would be difficult of general application to girls.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Education! That's what I call education.' ` <div class="bookquote">` I don't see it at all, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>returned the obstinate Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` Well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>I seek to repair what is amiss, if I possibly can; and I hope you will assist me in a good spirit, Bounderby, for I have been very much distressed.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I assure you I have no desire to be controversial. I don't understand you, yet,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, with determined obstinacy, <div class="bookquote">`and therefore I won't make any promises.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>In the course of a few hours, my dear Bounderby,' Mr. Gradgrind proceeded, in the same depressed and propitiatory manner, `I appear to myself to have become better informed as to Louisa's character, than in previous years.
<p/>I think there are - Bounderby, you will be surprised to hear me say this - I think there are qualities in Louisa,
<p/>` The enlightenment has been painfully forced upon me, and the discovery is not mine. which - which have been harshly neglected, and - and a little perverted.
<p/>And - and I would suggest to you, that - that if you would kindly meet me in a timely endeavour to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) better nature for a while - and to encourage it to develop itself by tenderness and consideration - it - it would be the better for the happiness of all of us.
<p/>The blustrous Bounderby crimsoned and swelled to such an extent on hearing these words, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) seemed to be, and probably was, on the brink of a fit.
<p/>With his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) very ears a bright purple shot with crimson, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) pent up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) indignation, however, and said: <div class="bookquote">`You'd like to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) here for a time?'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I - I had intended to recommend, my dear Bounderby, that you should allow Louisa to remain here on a visit, and be attended by Sissy

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>I gather from all this, Tom Gradgrind,' said Bounderby, standing up with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) pockets, <div class="bookquote">`that you are of opinion that there's what people call some incompatibility between Loo Bounderby and myself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>I fear there is at present a general incompatibility between Louisa, and - and - and almost all the relations in which I have placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>),' was her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father's sorrowful reply. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, look you here, Tom Gradgrind,'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby the flushed, confronting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) legs wide apart, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hands deeper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) pockets, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hair like a hayfield wherein his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) windy anger was boisterous. `
<p/>` <div class="bookquote">` You have said your say; I am going to say mine. I am a Coketown man. I am Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.
<p/>I know the bricks of this town, and I know the works of this town, and I know the chimneys of this town, and I know the smoke of this town, and I know the Hands of this town.
<p/>When a man tells me anything about imaginative qualities, I always tell that man, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, that I know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) means.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) means turtle soup and venison, with a gold spoon, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants to be set up with a coach and six.
<p/>Since you are of opinion that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ought to have what she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wants, I recommend you to provide it for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).

<p/>I heard you out; hear me out, if you please. Now, there's an incompatibility of some sort or another , I am given to understand by you, between your daughter and me.
<p/>I'll give you to understand, in reply to that, that there unquestionably is an incompatibility of the first magnitude - to be summed up in this - that your daughter don't properly know her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband's merits, and is not impressed with such a sense as would become her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), by George! of the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) alliance.

<p/>Because when Tom Gradgrind, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) new lights, tells me that what I say is unreasonable, I am convinced at once it must be devilish sensible.

<p/>Yet you may believe or not, as you think proper, that there are ladies - born ladies - belonging to families - Families! - who next to worship the ground I walk on.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>With your permission I am going on.

<p/>That you know, yourself. Not that I care a pinch of candle-snuff about such things, for you are very well aware

<p/>Not, I fear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Gradgrind, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">`to spare me.'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>That is,' the consideration checked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), 'till I have said all I mean to say, and then I don't care how soon we stop.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`On the contrary, Tom Gradgrind, the more we say to-night, the better, I think. I come to a question that may shorten the business.

<p/>I have already said, I fear Louisa has not been understood. Is it asking too much, Bounderby, that you, so far her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) elder, should aid in trying to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) right?
<p/>You have accepted a great charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>); for better for worse, for - ` Mr. Bounderby may have been annoyed by the repetition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) own words to Stephen Blackpool, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) cut the quotation short with an angry start. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), `I don't want to be told about that. I know what I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) for, as well as you do.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I was merely going on to remark, Bounderby, that we may all be more or less in the wrong, not even excepting you; and that some yielding on your part, remembering the trust you have accepted, may not only be an act of true kindness, but perhaps a debt incurred towards Louisa.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Never you mind what I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) for; that's my look out.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I think differently,' blustered Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` I am going to finish this business according to my own opinions.
<p/>To tell you the truth, I don't think it would be worthy of my reputation to quarrel on such a subject.
<p/>Now, I don't want to make a quarrel of it with you, Tom Gradgrind. As to your gentleman-friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) may take himself off, wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) likes best.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) falls in my way, I shall tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) my mind; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) don't fall in my way, I shan't, for it won't be worth my while to do it.
<p/>As to your daughter, whom I made Loo Bounderby, and might have done better by leaving Loo Gradgrind, if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) don't come home to-morrow, by twelve o'clock at noon, I shall understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) prefers to stay away, and I shall send her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) wearing apparel and so forth over here, and you'll take charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) for the future.
<p/>What I shall say to people in general, of the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this.
<p/>I am Josiah Bounderby, and I had my bringing- up; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)'s the daughter of Tom Gradgrind, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) bringing- up; and the two horses wouldn't pull together.
<p/>I am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, I believe; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a woman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up to my mark.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this, Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>urged Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`before you commit yourself to such a decision.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I should be surprised at Tom Gradgrind's addressing such a remark to Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) knows of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), if I could be surprised by anything Tom Gradgrind did, after his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) making himself a party to sentimental humbug.
<p/>I always come to a decision,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hat on: <div class="bookquote">`and whatever I do, I do at once. I have given you my decision, and I have got no more to say.
<p/>At five minutes past twelve o'clock next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) directed Mrs. Bounderby's property to be carefully packed up and sent to Tom Gradgrind's; advertised his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) country retreat for sale by private contract; and resumed a bachelor life.
<p/>CHAPTER IV - LOST THE robbery at the Bank had not languished before, and did not cease to occupy a front place in the attention of the principal of that establishment now.
<p/>In boastful proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) promptitude and activity, as a remarkable man, and a self-made man, and a commercial wonder more admirable than Venus, who had risen out of the mud instead of the sea, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked to show how little his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) domestic affairs abated his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) business ardour.
<p/>Consequently, in the first few weeks of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resumed bachelorhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even advanced upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) usual display of bustle, and every day made such a rout in renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) investigations into the robbery, that the officers who had it in hand almost wished it had never been committed.
<p/>Good night!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>So Mr. Bounderby went home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) town house to bed. They were at fault too, and off the scent.
<p/>Although they had been so quiet since the first outbreak of the matter, that most people really did suppose it to have been abandoned as hopeless, nothing new occurred.
<p/>No implicated man or woman took untimely courage, or made a self-betraying step. More remarkable yet, Stephen Blackpool could not be heard of, and the mysterious old woman remained a mystery.
<p/>Things having come to this pass, and showing no latent signs of stirring beyond it, the upshot of Mr. Bounderby's investigations was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) resolved to hazard a bold burst.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) drew up a placard, offering Twenty Pounds reward for the apprehension of Stephen Blackpool, suspected of complicity in the robbery of Coketown Bank on such a night; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) described the said Stephen Blackpool by dress, complexion, estimated height, and manner, as minutely as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) could; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) recited how he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) had left the town, and in what direction he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) had been last seen going; he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) had the whole printed in great black letters on a staring broadsheet; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) caused the walls to be posted with it in the dead of night, so that it should strike upon the sight of the whole population at one blow.
<p/>The factory-bells had need to ring their loudest that morning to disperse the groups of workers who stood in the tardy daybreak, collected round the placards, devouring them with eager eyes.
<p/>These people, as they listened to the friendly voice that read aloud - there was always some such ready to help them - stared at the characters which meant so much with a vague awe and respect that would have been half ludicrous, if any aspect of public ignorance could ever be otherwise than threatening and full of evil.
<p/>Many ears and eyes were busy with a vision of the matter of these placards, among turning spindles, rattling looms, and whirling wheels, for hours afterwards; and when the Hands cleared out again into the streets, there were still as many readers as before.
<p/>Slackbridge, the delegate, had to address his (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) audience too that night; and Slackbridge had obtained a clean bill from the printer, and had brought it in his (<font color='blue'><b>delegate</b></font>) pocket.
<p/>Oh, my friends and fellow- countrymen, the down-trodden operatives of Coketown, oh, my fellow- brothers and fellow-workmen and fellow-citizens and fellowmen, what a to-do was there, when Slackbridge unfolded what he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) called <div class="bookquote">`that damning document,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and held it up to the gaze, and for the execration of the working-man community! <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh, my fellow-men, behold of what a traitor in the camp of those great spirits who are enrolled upon the holy scroll of Justice and of Union, is appropriately capable!
<p/>Oh, my prostrate friends, with the galling yoke of tyrants on your necks and the iron foot of despotism treading down your fallen forms into the dust of the earth, upon which right glad would your oppressors be to see you creeping on your bellies all the days of your lives, like the serpent in the garden -
<p/>oh, my brothers, and shall I as a man not add, my sisters too, what do you say, now, of Stephen Blackpool, with a slight stoop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) shoulders and about five foot seven in height, as set forth in this degrading and disgusting document, this blighting bill, this pernicious placard, this abominable advertisement; and with what majesty of denouncement will you crush the viper, who would bring this stain and shame upon the God-like race that happily has cast him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) out for ever!
<p/>Not the least eager of the eyes assembled, were the eyes of those who could not read. Yes, my compatriots, happily cast him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) out and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) forth!
<p/>For you remember how he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) stood here before you on this platform; you remember how, face to face and foot to foot, I pursued him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) through all his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) intricate windings; you remember how he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) sneaked and slunk, and sidled, and splitted of straws, until, with not an inch of ground to which to cling, I hurled him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) out from amongst us:
<p/>an object for the undying finger of scorn to point at, and for the avenging fire of every free and thinking mind to scorch and scar!
<p/>And now, my friends - my labouring friends, for I rejoice and triumph in that stigma - my friends whose hard but honest beds are made in toil, and whose scanty but independent pots are boiled in hardship; and now, I say, my friends, what appellation has that dastard craven taken to himself, when, with the mask torn from his (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) features, he (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) stands before us in all his (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) native deformity, a What?
<p/>A proscribed fugitive, with a price upon his (<font color='blue'><b>craven</b></font>) head; a fester and a wound upon the noble character of the Coketown operative!
<p/>Therefore, my band of brothers in a sacred bond, to which your children and your children's children yet unborn have set their infant hands and seals, I propose to you on the part of the United Aggregate Tribunal, ever watchful for your welfare, ever zealous for your benefit, that this meeting does Resolve: That Stephen Blackpool, weaver, referred to in this placard, having been already solemnly disowned by the community of Coketown Hands, the same are free from the shame of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) misdeeds, and cannot as a class be reproached with his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) dishonest actions!'
 (<font color='red'><b>working-man</b></font>)</div><p/>A thief! A plunderer! Thus Slackbridge; gnashing and perspiring after a prodigious sort. A few stern voices called out <div class="bookquote">`No!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and a score or two hailed, with assenting cries of <div class="bookquote">`Hear, hear!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But these were pigmies against an army; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to Slackbridge, and gave three cheers for him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) sat demonstratively panting at them.
<p/>These men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their homes, when Sissy, who had been called away from Louisa some minutes before, returned. `
<p/>the caution from one man, <div class="bookquote">`Slackbridge, y'or over hetter in't; y'or a goen too fast!'  (<font color='red'><b>man y'</b></font>)</div>Who is it?' asked Louisa. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is Mr. Bounderby,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Sissy, timid of the name, <div class="bookquote">`and your brother Mr. Tom, and a young woman who says her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) name is Rachael, and that you know her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` What do they want, Sissy dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` They want to see you. Rachael has been crying, and seems angry.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) answered in the affirmative, Sissy went away to bring them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) reappeared with them directly. Tom was last; and remained standing in the obscurest part of the room, near the door. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>This is an unseasonable hour, but here is a young woman who has been making statements which render my visit necessary.
<p/>Tom Gradgrind, as your son, young Tom, refuses for some obstinate reason or other to say anything at all about those statements, good or bad, I am obliged to confront her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with your daughter.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Bounderby,' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) husband, entering with a cool nod, `I don't disturb you, I hope. <div class="bookquote">` You have seen me once before, young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Rachael, standing in front of Louisa.
<p/>Tom coughed. <div class="bookquote">` You have seen me, young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>Tom/Tom Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>repeated Rachael, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) did not answer, <div class="bookquote">`once before.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Tom coughed again. `
<p/>Rachael cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) eyes proudly towards Mr. Bounderby, and said, <div class="bookquote">`Will you make it known, young lady, where, and who was there?'

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>I can't tell but what you may ha' come wi' some aim of your own, not mindin to what trouble you brought such as the poor lad.
<p/>I said then, Bless you for coming; and I said it of my heart, you seemed to take so pitifully to him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>); but I don't know now, I don't know!'
<p/>Louisa could not reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) unjust suspicions; she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was so faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) idea of the man, and so afflicted. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>- <div class="bookquote">` You're a pretty article,'  (<font color='red'><b>the whelp</b></font>)</div>growled the whelp, moving uneasily in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) dark corner, `to come here with these precious imputations!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) said nothing in reply; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) low weeping was the only sound that was heard, until Mr. Bounderby spoke. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You ought to be bundled out for not knowing how to behave yourself, and you would be by rights.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>Young lady, when I had read what's put in print of Stephen - and what has just as much truth in it as if it had been put in print of you
<p/>- I went straight to the Bank to say I knew where Stephen was, and to give a sure and certain promise that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) should be here in two days.
<p/>I couldn't meet wi'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bounderby then, and your brother sent me away, and I tried to find you, but you was not to be found, and I went back to work.
<p/>Soon as I come out of the Mill to-night, I hastened to hear what was said of Stephen - for I know wi' pride he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) will come back to shame it! -
<p/>and then I went again to seek Mr. Bounderby, and I found him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) every word I knew; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) believed no word I said, and brought me here.'
<p/>You had better give your mind to that; not this.' '' <div class="bookquote">`So far, that's true enough,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>But I have known you people before to-day, you'll observe, and I know you never die for want of talking. Now, I recommend you not so much to mind talking just now, as doing.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`I have written to Stephen by the post that went out this afternoon, as I have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) once before sin'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) went away,' said Rachael; <div class="bookquote">`and he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) will be here, at furthest, in two days.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>You have undertaken to do something; all I remark upon that at present is, do it!' <div class="bookquote">` Then, I'll tell you something.
<p/>You are not aware perhaps,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`that you yourself have been looked after now and then, not being considered quite free from suspicion in this business, on account of most people being judged according to the company they keep.
<p/>The post-office hasn't been forgotten either. What I'll tell you is, that no letter to Stephen Blackpool has ever got into it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) hadn't been gone from here, young lady,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><p/>Therefore, what has become of yours, I leave you to guess. Perhaps you're mistaken, and never wrote any.' ` <div class="bookquote">` Oh, by George!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR.

<p/>What,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Rachael, with the tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) eyes again, <div class="bookquote">`what, young lady, in the name of Mercy, was left the poor lad to do!
<p/>The masters against him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) on one hand, the men against him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) on the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) only wantin to work hard in peace, and do what he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) felt right.

<p/>Indeed, indeed, I pity him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) from my heart,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>returned Louisa; <div class="bookquote">`and I hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will clear himself.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You need have no fear of that, young lady.

(<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) shall come back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) own accord to clear himself, and put all those that have injured his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) good character, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) not here for its defence, to shame.
<p/>I have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) what has been done against him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>said Rachael, throwing off all distrust as a rock throws of the sea, <div class="bookquote">`and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) will be here, at furthest, in two days.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>Notwithstanding which,' added Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) can be laid hold of any sooner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself.
<p/>As to you, I have nothing against you; what you came and told me turns out to be true, and I have given you the means of proving it to be true, and there's an end of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) shall not, through any act of mine, come back wi'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>the unmerited reproach of being brought back. <div class="bookquote">` I wish you good night all!
<p/>Tom came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) corner when Mr. Bounderby moved, moved with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), kept close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), and went away with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>).
<p/>I must be off to look a little further into this.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The only parting salutation of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) delivered himself was a sulky <div class="bookquote">`Good night, father!'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>With a brief speech, and a scowl at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) left the house. Since his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) sheet-anchor had come home, Mr. Gradgrind had been sparing of speech.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) still sat silent, when Louisa mildly said: <div class="bookquote">`Rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you know me better.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It goes against me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>Rachael answered, in a gentler manner, <div class="bookquote">`to mistrust any one; but when I am so mistrusted - when we all are - I cannot keep such things quite out of my mind.
<p/>I ask your pardon for having done you an injury. I don't think what I said now. Yet I might come to think it again, wi'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>the poor lad so wronged.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Did you tell him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) in your letter,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>inquired Sissy, <div class="bookquote">`that suspicion seemed to have fallen upon him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had been seen about the Bank at night?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would then know what he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) would have to explain on coming back, and would be ready.'

<p/>but I can't guess what can have ever taken him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) there. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) never used to go there. It was never in his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) way.
<p/>Sissy had already been at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) side asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) lived, and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) way was the same as mine, and not near it.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I doubt,' said Rachael, <div class="bookquote">`if he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) can be here till next day.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>When Rachael, assenting to this, was gone, Mr. Gradgrind lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) head, and said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) daughter: `Louisa, my dear, I have never, that I know of, seen this man.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Then I will come next night too,'  (<font color='red'><b>this man</b></font>)</div>said Sissy. Do you believe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be implicated?' <div class="bookquote">` I think I have believed it, father, though with great difficulty.
<p/>I do not believe it now.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` That is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be suspected.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) appearance and manner; are they so honest?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Very honest.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) confidence not to be shaken! I ask myself,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, musing, <div class="bookquote">`does the real culprit know of these accusations?
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) leaned upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hand again, looking gray and old, Louisa, with a face of fear and pity, hurriedly went over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), and sat close at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) side.
<p/>Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>)? Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hair had latterly began to change its colour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes by accident met Sissy's at the moment.
<p/>Sissy flushed and started, and Louisa put her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) finger on her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) lip. Next night, when Sissy returned home and told Louisa that Stephen was not come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) told it in a whisper.
<p/>Next night again, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) came home with the same account, and added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had not been heard of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) spoke in the same low frightened tone.
<p/>From the moment of that interchange of looks, they never uttered his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) name, or any reference to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), aloud; nor ever pursued the subject of the robbery, when Mr. Gradgrind spoke of it.
<p/>The two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and Stephen Blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of.
<p/>On the fourth day, Rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) despatch to have miscarried, went up to the Bank, and showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road, sixty miles away.
<p/>Messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town looked for Stephen to be brought in next day. During this whole time the whelp moved about with Mr. Bounderby like his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) shadow, assisting in all the proceedings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was greatly excited, horribly fevered, bit his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) nails down to the quick, spoke in a hard rattling voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up.
<p/>At the hour when the suspected man was looked for, the whelp was at the station; offering to wager that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had made off before the arrival of those who were sent in quest of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not appear.
<p/>The whelp was right. The messengers returned alone. Rachael's letter had gone, Rachael's letter had been delivered. Stephen Blackpool had decamped in that same hour; and no soul knew more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>).
<p/>The only doubt in Coketown was, whether Rachael had written in good faith, believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) really would come back, or warning him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) to fly.
<p/>On this point opinion was divided. Six days, seven days, far on into another week. The wretched whelp plucked up a ghastly courage, and began to grow defiant. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Was the suspected fellow the thief? A pretty question! If not, where was the man, and why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not come back?'
 (<font color='red'><b>The whelp</b></font>)</div><p/>In the dead of night the echoes of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own words, which had rolled Heaven knows how far away in the daytime, came back instead, and abided by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) until morning.
<p/>Where was the man, and why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not come back? CHAPTER V - FOUND DAY and night again, day and night again.
<p/>No Stephen Blackpool. Where was the man, and why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not come back? Every night, Sissy went to Rachael's lodging, and sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) small neat room.
<p/>The smoke-serpents were indifferent who was lost or found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy mad elephants, like the Hard Fact men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever happened.
<p/>All day, Rachael toiled as such people must toil, whatever their anxieties. Day and night again, day and night again. The monotony was unbroken.
<p/>Even Stephen Blackpool's disappearance was falling into the general way, and becoming as monotonous a wonder as any piece of machinery in Coketown. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I misdoubt,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div>said Rachael, <div class="bookquote">`if there is as many as twenty left in all this place, who have any trust in the poor dear lad now.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>Sissy had come there when it was already dark, to await her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) return from work; and they had since sat at the window where Rachael had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), wanting no brighter light to shine on their sorrowful talk. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>If it hadn't been mercifully brought about, that I was to have you to speak to,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>pursued Rachael, <div class="bookquote">`times are, when I think my mind would not have kept right.
<p/>But I get hope and strength through you; and you believe that though appearances may rise against him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will be proved clear?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) said it to Sissy, as they sat in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) lodging, lighted only by the lamp at the street corner. <div class="bookquote">`I do believe so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>returned Sissy, <div class="bookquote">`with my whole heart.
<p/>I feel so certain, Rachael, that the confidence you hold in yours against all discouragement, is not like to be wrong, that I have no more doubt of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) than if I had known him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) through as many years of trial as you have.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>And I, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel</b></font>)</div>said Rachel, with a tremble in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachel</b></font>) voice, <div class="bookquote">`have known him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) through them all, to be, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) quiet ways, so faithful to everything honest and good, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was never to be heard of more, and I was to live to be a hundred years old, I could say with my last breath, God knows my heart.
<p/>I have never once left trusting Stephen Blackpool!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachel</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`We all believe, up at the Lodge, Rachael, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) will be freed from suspicion, sooner or later.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I know it to be so believed there, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>said Rachael, <div class="bookquote">`and the kinder I feel it that you come away from there, purposely to comfort me, and keep me company, and be seen wi'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>me when I am not yet free from all suspicion myself, the more grieved I am that I should ever have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady.
<p/>The better And yet I - ` <div class="bookquote">` You don't mistrust her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) now, Rachael?'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>`Now that you have brought us more together, no.
<p/>But I can't at all times keep out of my mind - ` Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) voice so sunk into a low and slow communing with herself, that Sissy, sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) side, was obliged to listen with attention. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>, I can't think how or why it may be done, but I mistrust that some one has put Stephen out of the way.
<p/>I mistrust that by his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) coming back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) own accord, and showing himself innocent before them all, some one would be confounded, who - to prevent that - has stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>), and put him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) out of the way.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/>I can't at all times keep out of my mind, mistrustings of some one. I can't think who 'tis <div class="bookquote">` That is a dreadful thought,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Sissy, turning pale. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>When it makes its way into my mind, dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said Rachael, <div class="bookquote">`and it will come sometimes, though I do all I can to keep it out, wi'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>counting on to high numbers as I work, and saying over and over again pieces that I knew when I were a child
<p/>- I fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however tired I am, I want to walk fast, miles and miles.
<p/>It is a dreadful thought to think he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may be murdered.' Sissy shuddered, and turned paler yet. <div class="bookquote">` I must get the better of this before bed-time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might fall ill upon the journey back,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said Sissy, faintly offering a worn-out scrap of hope; <div class="bookquote">`and in such a case, there are many places on the road where he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might stop.'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'll walk home wi'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>you.' <div class="bookquote">` But he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is in none of them. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has been sought for in all, and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s not there.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was footsore and couldn't walk, I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), in the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got, the money to ride, lest he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) should have none of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own to spare.'
<p/><div class="bookquote">` True,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was Sissy's reluctant admission. ` He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'d walk the journey in two days. `Let us hope that to-morrow will bring something better, Rachael.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) gentle hand adjusted Rachael's shawl upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) shining black hair in the usual manner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) wearing it, and they went out.
<p/>The night being fine, little knots of Hands were here and there lingering at street corners; but it was supper-time with the greater part of them, and there were but few people in the streets. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come into the air!'  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>You're not so hurried now, Rachael, and your hand is cooler.' ` I get better, dear, if I can only walk, and breathe a little fresh. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Times when I can't, I turn weak and confused.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But you must not begin to fail, Rachael, for you may be wanted at any time to stand by Stephen.
<p/>To-morrow is Saturday. If no news comes to-morrow, let us walk in the country on Sunday morning, and strengthen you for another week.
<p/>Will you go?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, dear.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>They were by this time in the street where Mr. Bounderby's house stood. The way to Sissy's destination led them past the door, and they were going straight towards it.
<p/>Some train had newly arrived in Coketown, which had put a number of vehicles in motion, and scattered a considerable bustle about the town.
<p/>Several coaches were rattling before them and behind them as they approached Mr. Bounderby's, and one of the latter drew up with such briskness as they were in the act of passing the house, that they looked round involuntarily.
<p/>The bright gaslight over Mr. Bounderby's steps showed them Mrs. Sparsit in the coach, in an ecstasy of excitement, struggling to open the door; Mrs. Sparsit seeing them at the same moment, called to them to stop. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's a coincidence,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was released by the coachman. <div class="bookquote">` It's a Providence! Come out, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>the coachman</b></font>)</div>then said Mrs. Sparsit, to some one inside, <div class="bookquote">`come out, or we'll have you dragged out!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Hereupon, no other than the mysterious old woman descended. Whom Mrs. Sparsit incontinently collared. <div class="bookquote">` Leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) alone, everybody!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Sparsit, with great energy. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Let nobody touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) belongs to me. Come in, ma'am!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>then said Mrs. Sparsit, reversing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) former word of command. `
<p/>The spectacle of a matron of classical deportment, seizing an ancient woman by the throat, and hauling her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) into a dwelling-house, would have been under any circumstances, sufficient temptation to all true English stragglers so blest as to witness it, to force a way into that dwelling-house and see the matter out.
<p/>But when the phenomenon was enhanced by the notoriety and mystery by this time associated all over the town with the Bank robbery, it would have lured the stragglers in, with an irresistible attraction, though the roof had been expected to fall upon their heads.
<p/>Accordingly, the chance witnesses on the ground, consisting of the busiest of the neighbours to the number of some five-and-twenty, closed in after Sissy and Rachael, as they closed in after Mrs. Sparsit and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) prize; and the whole body made a disorderly irruption into Mr. Bounderby's dining-room, where the people behind lost not a moment's time in mounting on the chairs, to get the better of the people in front. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Come in, ma'am, or we'll have you dragged in!'  (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>Fetch Mr. Bounderby down!' cried Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` Rachael, young woman; you know who this is?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It's Mrs. Pegler,'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>said Rachael. <div class="bookquote">` I should think it is!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Sparsit, exulting. <div class="bookquote">` Fetch Mr. Bounderby. Stand away, everybody!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Here old Mrs. Pegler, muffling herself up, and shrinking from observation, whispered a word of entreaty. <div class="bookquote">` Don't tell me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, aloud. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have told you twenty times, coming along, that I will not leave you till I have handed you over to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) myself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bounderby now appeared, accompanied by Mr. Gradgrind and the whelp, with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had been holding conference up-stairs. Mr. Bounderby looked more astonished than hospitable, at sight of this uninvited party in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) dining-room. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>this party</b></font>)</div>explained that worthy woman, <div class="bookquote">`I trust it is my good fortune to produce a person you have much desired to find.
<p/>Stimulated by my wish to relieve your mind, sir, and connecting together such imperfect clues to the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside, as have been afforded by the young woman, Rachael, fortunately now present to identify, I have had the happiness to succeed, and to bring that person with me - I need not say most unwillingly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) part.
<p/>It has not been, sir, without some trouble that I have effected this; but trouble in your service is to me a pleasure, and hunger, thirst, and cold a real gratification.'
 (<font color='red'><b>woman</b></font>)</div><p/>Here Mrs. Sparsit ceased; for Mr. Bounderby's visage exhibited an extraordinary combination of all possible colours and expressions of discomfiture, as old Mrs. Pegler was disclosed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) view. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Why, what's the matter now!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Why, what do you mean by this?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) highly unexpected demand, in great warmth. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I ask you, what do you mean by this, Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Sparsit, faintly. <div class="bookquote">` Why don't you mind your own business, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>roared Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How dare you go and poke your officious nose into my family affairs?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>This allusion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) favourite feature overpowered Mrs. Sparsit.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) sat down stiffly in a chair, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) were frozen; and with a fixed stare at Mr. Bounderby, slowly grated her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) mittens against one another, as if they were frozen too. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear Josiah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Pegler, trembling. <div class="bookquote">` My darling boy! I am not to blame. It's not my fault, Josiah.
<p/>I told this lady over and over again, that I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was doing what would not be agreeable to you, but she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would do it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Couldn't you knock her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cap off, or her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) tooth out, or scratch her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), or do something or other to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>asked Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) threatened me that if I resisted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), I should be brought by constables, and it was better to come quietly than make that stir in
<p/>What did you let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bring you for? My own boy! such a'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>- Mrs. Pegler glanced timidly but proudly round the walls - <div class="bookquote">`such a fine house as this.
<p/>Indeed, indeed, it is not my fault! My dear, noble, stately boy! I have always lived quiet, and secret, Josiah, my dear.
<p/>I have admired you at a distance; and if I have come to town sometimes, with long times between, to take a proud peep at you, I have done it unbeknown, my love, and gone away again.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bounderby, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hands in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) pockets, walked in impatient mortification up and down at the side of the long dining-table, while the spectators greedily took in every syllable of Mrs. Pegler's appeal, and at each succeeding syllable became more and more round-eyed.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby still walking up and down when Mrs. Pegler had done, Mr. Gradgrind addressed that maligned old lady: <div class="bookquote">`I am surprised, madam,'  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) observed with severity, <div class="bookquote">`that in your old age you have the face to claim Mr. Bounderby for your son, after your unnatural and inhuman treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I have never broken the condition once. I have never said I was your mother. Me unnatural!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried poor old Mrs. Pegler. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Me inhuman! To my dear boy?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` Yes; dear in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) self-made prosperity, madam, I dare say.
<p/>Not very dear, however, when you deserted him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) infancy, and left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) to the brutality of a drunken grandmother.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Now, Lord forgive you, sir, for your wicked imaginations, and for your scandal against the memory of my poor mother, who died in my arms before Josiah was born.
<p/>I deserted my Josiah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Pegler, clasping her (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) hands. <div class="bookquote">` May you repent of it, sir, and live to know better!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) was so very earnest and injured, that Mr. Gradgrind, shocked by the possibility which dawned upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), said in a gentler tone: <div class="bookquote">`Do you deny, then, madam, that you left your son to - to be brought up in the gutter?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>My dear boy knows, and will give you to know, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) come of humble parents, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) come of parents that loved him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) as dear as the best could, and never thought it hardship on themselves to pinch a bit that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might write and cipher beautiful, and I've his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) books at home to show it!
<p/>Josiah in the gutter!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Pegler. <div class="bookquote">` No such a thing, sir. Never! For shame on you! Aye, have I!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pegler, with indignant pride. `
<p/>And my dear boy knows, and will give you to know, sir, that after his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) beloved father died, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was eight years old, his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother, too, could pinch a bit, as it was her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) duty and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pleasure and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) pride to do it, to help him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) out in life, and put him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">`prentice.
<p/>And a steady lad he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) was, and a kind master he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) had to lend him (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) a hand, and well he (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) worked his (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) own way forward to be rich and thriving.
<p/>my dear boy won't - that though his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) mother kept but a little village shop, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) never forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), but pensioned me on thirty pound a year - more than I want, for I put by out of it - only making the condition that I was to keep down in my own part, and make no boasts about him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and not trouble him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>).
<p/>And I'll give you to know, sir - for this And I never have, except with looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) once a year, when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has never knowed it.
<p/>And it's right,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said poor old Mrs. Pegler, in affectionate championship, <div class="bookquote">`that I should keep down in my own part, and I have no doubts that if I was here I should do a many unbefitting things, and I am well contented, and I can keep my pride in my Josiah to myself, and
<p/>I can love for love's own sake! And I am ashamed of you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Pegler, lastly, <div class="bookquote">`for your slanders and suspicions.
<p/>And I never stood here before, nor never wanted to stand here when my dear son said no. And I shouldn't be here now, if it hadn't been for being brought here.
<p/>And for shame upon you, Oh, for shame, to accuse me of being a bad mother to my son, with my son standing here to tell you so different!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Pegler/Pegler</b></font>)</div><p/>The bystanders, on and off the dining-room chairs, raised a murmur of sympathy with Mrs. Pegler, and Mr. Gradgrind felt himself innocently placed in a very distressing predicament, when Mr. Bounderby, who had never ceased walking up and down, and had every moment swelled larger and larger, and grown redder and redder, stopped short. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I don't exactly know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, <div class="bookquote">`how I come to be favoured with the attendance of the present company, but I don't inquire.
<p/>When they're quite satisfied, perhaps they'll be so good as to disperse; whether they're satisfied or not, perhaps they'll be so good as to disperse.
<p/>I'm not bound to deliver a lecture on my family affairs, I have not undertaken to do it, and I'm not a going to do it.
<p/>Therefore those who expect any explanation whatever upon that branch of the subject, will be disappointed - particularly Tom Gradgrind, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) can't know it too soon.
<p/>In reference to the Bank robbery, there has been a mistake made, concerning my mother. If there hadn't been over-officiousness it wouldn't have been made, and I hate over-officiousness at all times, whether or no.
<p/>Although Mr. Bounderby carried it off in these terms, holding the door open for the company to depart, there was a blustering sheepishness upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), at once extremely crestfallen and superlatively absurd.
<p/>Detected as the Bully of humility, who had built his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) windy reputation upon lies, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) boastfulness had put the honest truth as far away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had advanced the mean claim -LRB-there is no meaner-RRB- to tack himself on to a pedigree, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) cut a most ridiculous figure.
<p/>With the people filing off at the door he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) held, who he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) knew would carry what had passed to the whole town, to be given to the four winds, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) could not have looked a Bully more shorn and forlorn, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) ears cropped.
<p/>Even that unlucky female, Mrs. Sparsit, fallen from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) pinnacle of exultation into the Slough of Despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man and self-made Humbug, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown.
<p/>Rachael and Sissy, leaving Mrs. Pegler to occupy a bed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) son's for that night, walked together to the gate of Stone Lodge and there parted.
<p/>Mr. Gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far, and spoke with much interest of Stephen Blackpool; for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) thought this signal failure of the suspicions against Mrs. Pegler was likely to work well.
<p/>Good evening!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>As to the whelp; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) had stuck close to Bounderby.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) seemed to feel that as long as Bounderby could make no discovery without his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) knowledge, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was so far safe.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) never visited his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) sister, and had only seen her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) once since she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went home: that is to say on the night when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) still stuck close to Bounderby, as already related.
<p/>There was one dim unformed fear lingering about his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) sister's mind, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) never gave utterance, which surrounded the graceless and ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery.
<p/>The same dark possibility had presented itself in the same shapeless guise, this very day, to Sissy, when Rachael spoke of some one who would be confounded by Stephen's return, having put him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) out of the way.
<p/>Louisa had never spoken of harbouring any suspicion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brother in connexion with the robbery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) and Sissy had held no confidence on the subject, save in that one interchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gray head on his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand; but it was understood between them, and they both knew it.
<p/>This other fear was so awful, that it hovered about each of them like a ghostly shadow; neither daring to think of its being near herself, far less of its being near the other.
<p/>And still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up, throve with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). If Stephen Blackpool was not the thief, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) show himself.
<p/>Why didn't he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>)? Another night. Another day and night. No Stephen Blackpool. Where was the man, and why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not come back?
<p/>CHAPTER VI - THE STARLIGHT THE Sunday was a bright Sunday in autumn, clear and cool, when early in the morning
<p/>As Coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the neighbourhood's too - after the manner of those pious persons who do penance for their own sins by putting other people into sackcloth - it was customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air, which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life, to get a few miles away by the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their lounge in the fields.
<p/>Sissy and Rachael helped themselves out of the smoke by the usual means, and were put down at a station about midway between the town and Mr. Bounderby's retreat.
<p/>Though the green landscape was blotted here and there with heaps of coal, it was green elsewhere, and there were trees to see, and there were larks singing -LRB-though it was Sunday-RRB-, and there were pleasant scents in the air, and all was over-arched by a bright blue sky.
<p/>In the distance one way, Coketown showed as a black mist; in another distance hills began to rise; in a third, there was a faint change in the light of the horizon where it shone upon the far-off sea.
<p/>Under their feet, the grass was fresh; beautiful shadows of branches flickered upon it, and speckled it; hedgerows were luxuriant; everything was at peace.
<p/>Engines at pits' mouths, and lean old horses that had worn the circle of their daily labour into the ground, were alike quiet; wheels had ceased for a short space to turn; and the great wheel of earth seemed to revolve without the shocks and noises of another time.
<p/>They walked on across the fields and down the shady lanes, sometimes getting over a fragment of a fence so rotten that it dropped at a touch of the foot, sometimes passing near a wreck of bricks and beams overgrown with grass, marking the site of deserted works.
<p/>Sissy and Rachael met, to walk in the country. They followed paths and tracks, however slight. Mounds where the grass was rank and high, and where brambles, dock-weed, and such-like vegetation, were confusedly heaped together
<p/>, they always avoided; for dismal stories were told in that country of the old pits hidden beneath such indications. The sun was high when they sat down to rest.
<p/>It is so still here, Rachael, and the way is so untrodden, that I think we must be the first who have been here all the summer.'
<p/>They had seen no one, near or distant, for a long time; and the solitude remained unbroken. ` As Sissy said it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) eyes were attracted by another of those rotten fragments of fence upon the ground.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) got up to look at it. <div class="bookquote">` And yet I don't know. This has not been broken very long. The wood is quite fresh where it gave way.
<p/>Here are footsteps too. - O Rachael!'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) ran back, and caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) round the neck. Rachael had already started up. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What is the matter?'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I don't know. There is a hat lying in the grass.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They went forward together. Rachael took it up, shaking from head to foot.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) broke into a passion of tears and lamentations: Stephen Blackpool was written in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) own hand on the inside. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>O the poor lad, the poor lad! He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) has been made away with. He (<font color='blue'><b>lad</b></font>) is lying murdered here!'  (<font color='red'><b>Stephen/Stephen Blackpool/STEPHEN BLACKPOOL</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Is there - has the hat any blood upon it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/>Sissy faltered. They were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of violence, inside or out.
<p/>It had been lying there some days, for rain and dew had stained it, and the mark of its shape was on the grass where it had fallen.
<p/>They looked fearfully about them, without moving, but could see nothing more. <div class="bookquote">` Rachael,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>Sissy whispered, <div class="bookquote">`I will go on a little by myself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) had unclasped her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when Rachael caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) in both arms with a scream that resounded over the wide landscape.
<p/>Before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass. They sprang back, and fell upon their knees, each hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) face upon the other's neck. `
<p/>At first this, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) terrific screams, were all that could be got from Rachael, by any tears, by any prayers, by any representations, by any means.
<p/>It was impossible to hush her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>); and it was deadly necessary to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), or she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) would have flung herself down the shaft. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>O, my good Lord! He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)'s down there! Down there!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Rachael, dear Rachael, good Rachael, for the love of Heaven, not these dreadful cries!
<p/>By an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of such a moment, Sissy at last brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) to be silent, and to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) with a tearless face of stone. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You wouldn't leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) lying maimed at the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Think of Stephen, think of Stephen, think of Stephen!'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>Rachael, Stephen may be living. No, no, no!' <div class="bookquote">`Don't stir from here, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) sake!
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) shuddered to approach the pit; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) crept towards it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hands and knees, and called to him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) as loud as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) could call.
<p/>Let me go and listen.'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) listened, but no sound replied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) called again and listened; still no answering sound. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) did this, twenty, thirty times.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) took a little clod of earth from the broken ground where he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) had stumbled, and threw it in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) could not hear it fall.
<p/>The wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago, almost carried despair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) brave heart, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) rose and looked all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), seeing no help. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Rachael, we must lose not a moment. We must go in different directions, seeking aid. You shall go by the way we have come, and I will go forward by the path.
<p/>Tell any one you see, and every one what has happened. Think of Stephen, think of Stephen!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) knew by Rachael's face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) might trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) now.
<p/>And after standing for a moment to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) running, wringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) ran, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) turned and went upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) own search; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) stopped at the hedge to tie her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) shawl there as a guide to the place, then threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) bonnet aside, and ran as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had never run before.
<p/>Quickening herself by carrying such entreaties in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) ran from field to field, and lane to lane, and place to place, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had never run before; until she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) came to a shed by an engine-house, where two men lay in the shade, asleep on straw.
<p/>First to wake them, and next to tell them, all so wild and breathless as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) was, what had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) there, were difficulties; but they no sooner understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) than their spirits were on fire like hers.
<p/>One of the men was in a drunken slumber, but on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) comrade's shouting to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) that a man had fallen down the Old Hell Shaft, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) started out to a pool of dirty water, put his (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) head in it, and came back sober.
<p/>Run, Sissy, run, in Heaven's name! Don't stop for breath. Run, run! With these two men she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) ran to another half-a-mile further, and with that one to another, while they ran elsewhere.
<p/>Then a horse was found; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) got another man to ride for life or death to the railroad, and send a message to Louisa, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) wrote and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>By this time a whole village was up: and windlasses, ropes, poles, candles, lanterns, all things necessary, were fast collecting and being brought into one place, to be carried to the Old Hell Shaft.
<p/>It seemed now hours and hours since she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had left the lost man lying in the grave where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been buried alive.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could not bear to remain away from it any longer - it was like deserting him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) - and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hurried swiftly back, accompanied by half-a-dozen labourers, including the drunken man whom the news had sobered, and who was the best man of all.
<p/>The men called and listened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had done, and examined the edge of the chasm, and settled how it had happened, and then sat down to wait until the implements they wanted should come up.
<p/>Every sound of insects in the air, every stirring of the leaves, every whisper among these men, made Sissy tremble, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) thought it was a cry at the bottom of the pit.
<p/>But the wind blew idly over it, and no sound arose to the surface, and they sat upon the grass, waiting and waiting.
<p/>After they had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the accident began to come up; then the real help of implements began to arrive.
<p/>In the midst of this, Rachael returned; and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) party there was a surgeon, who brought some wine and medicines.
<p/>When they came to the Old Hell Shaft, they found it as lonely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) had left it. But, the expectation among the people that the man would be found alive was very slight indeed.
<p/>There being now people enough present to impede the work, the sobered man put himself at the head of the rest, or was put there by the general consent, and made a large ring round the Old Hell Shaft, and appointed men to keep it.
<p/>Besides such volunteers as were accepted to work, only Sissy and Rachael were at first permitted within this ring; but, later in the day, when the message brought an express from Coketown, Mr. Gradgrind and Louisa, and Mr. Bounderby, and the whelp, were also there.
<p/>The sun was four hours lower than when Sissy and Rachael had first sat down upon the grass, before a means of enabling two men to descend securely was rigged with poles and ropes.
<p/>Difficulties had arisen in the construction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had been found wanting, and messages had had to go and return.
<p/>It was five o'clock in the afternoon of the bright autumnal Sunday, before a candle was sent down to try the air, while three or four rough faces stood crowded close together, attentively watching it: the man at the windlass lowering as they were told.
<p/>Then the bucket was hooked on; and the sobered man and another got in with lights, giving the word <div class="bookquote">`Lower away!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><p/>As the rope went out, tight and strained, and the windlass creaked, there was not a breath among the one or two hundred men and women looking on, that came as it was wont to come.
<p/>The candle was brought up again, feebly burning, and then some water was cast in. The signal was given and the windlass stopped, with abundant rope to spare.
<p/>Apparently so long an interval ensued with the men at the windlass standing idle, that some women shrieked that another accident had happened!
<p/>But the surgeon who held the watch, declared five minutes not to have elapsed yet, and sternly admonished them to keep silence.
<p/>Practised eyes knew that it did not go as heavily as it would if both workmen had been coming up, and that only one was returning.
<p/>The rope came in tight and strained; and ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass, and all eyes were fastened on the pit.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) had not well done speaking, when the windlass was reversed and worked again. The sobered man was brought up and leaped out briskly on the grass.
<p/>There was an universal cry of <div class="bookquote">`Alive or dead?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and then a deep, profound hush. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">`Alive!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>a great shout arose and many eyes had tears in them. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s hurt very bad,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could make himself heard again. <div class="bookquote">` Where's doctor? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)'s hurt so very bad, sir, that we donno how to get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) up.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They all consulted together, and looked anxiously at the surgeon, as he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) asked some questions, and shook his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) head on receiving the replies.
<p/>The sun was setting now; and the red light in the evening sky touched every face there, and caused it to be distinctly seen in all its rapt suspense.
<p/>The consultation ended in the men returning to the windlass, and the pitman going down again, carrying the wine and some other small matters with him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>).
<p/>In the meantime, under the surgeon's directions, some men brought a hurdle, on which others made a thick bed of spare clothes covered with loose straw, while he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) himself contrived some bandages and slings from shawls and handkerchiefs.
<p/>As these were made, they were hung upon an arm of the pitman who had last come up, with instructions how to use them: and as he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) stood, shown by the light he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) carried, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) powerful loose hand upon one of the poles, and sometimes glancing down the pit, and sometimes glancing round upon the people, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) was not the least conspicuous figure in the scene.
<p/>It appeared from the little this man said to those about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), which was quickly repeated all over the circle, that the lost man had fallen upon a mass of crumbled rubbish with which the pit was half choked up, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fall had been further broken by some jagged earth at the side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lay upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) back with one arm doubled under him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and according to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own belief had hardly stirred since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had moved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) free hand to a side pocket, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) remembered to have some bread and meat -LRB-of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had swallowed crumbs-RRB-, and had likewise scooped up a little water in it now and then.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had come straight away from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) work, on being written to, and had walked the whole journey; and was on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way to Mr. Bounderby's country house after dark, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fell.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was crossing that dangerous country at such a dangerous time, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was innocent of what was laid to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) charge, and couldn't rest from coming the nearest way to deliver himself up.
<p/>The Old Hell Shaft, the pitman said, with a curse upon it, was worthy of its bad name to the last; for though Stephen could speak now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) believed it would soon be found to have mangled the life out of him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>).
<p/>When all was ready, this man, still taking his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last hurried charges from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) comrades and the surgeon after the windlass had begun to lower him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), disappeared into the pit.
<p/>Then the other man came up. It was dark now, and torches were kindled. The rope went out as before, the signal was made as before, and the windlass stopped.
<p/>Every one waited with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grasp set, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) body bent down to the work, ready to reverse and wind in.
<p/>For, now, the rope came in, tightened and strained to its utmost as it appeared, and the men turned heavily, and the windlass complained.
<p/>No man removed his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand from it now. At length the signal was given, and all the ring leaned forward. It was scarcely endurable to look at the rope, and think of its giving way.
<p/>But, ring after ring was coiled upon the barrel of the windlass safely, and the connecting chains appeared, and finally the bucket with the two men holding on at the sides - a sight to make the head swim, and oppress the heart - and tenderly supporting between them, slung and tied within, the figure of a poor, crushed, human creature.
<p/>A low murmur of pity went round the throng, and the women wept aloud, as this form, almost without form, was moved very slowly from its iron deliverance, and laid upon the bed of straw.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) did what he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) could in its adjustment on the couch, but the best that he (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) could do was to cover it.
<p/>And at that time the pale, worn, patient face was seen looking up at the sky, with the broken right hand lying bare on the outside of the covering garments, as if waiting to be taken by another hand.
<p/>At first, none but the surgeon went close to it. That gently done, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) called to him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) Rachael and Sissy. They gave him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) drink, moistened his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) face with water, and administered some drops of cordial and wine.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) stooped down on the grass at his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) side, and bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) until her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) eyes were between his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) and the sky, for he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) could not so much as turn them to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>). `
<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) lay quite motionless looking up at the sky, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) smiled and said, <div class="bookquote">`Rachael.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Rachael, my dear.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) smiled again and said, `Don't let <div class="bookquote">`t go.'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Thou`rt in great pain, my own dear Stephen?'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>been, but not now.
<p/>I ha' been - dreadful, and dree, and long, my dear - but 'tis ower now. Ah, Rachael, aw a muddle!
<p/>Fro' first to last, a muddle!' The spectre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) old look seemed to pass as he (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) said the word. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>fell into th' pit, my dear, as have cost wi'in the knowledge o' old fok now livin, hundreds and hundreds o' men's lives - fathers, sons, brothers, dear to thousands an' thousands, an' keeping 'em fro' want and hunger.

<p/>See how we die an' no need, one way an' another - in a muddle - every day!' He (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) faintly said it, without any anger against any one.
<p/>Merely as the truth. <div class="bookquote">` Thy little sister, Rachael, thou hast not forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>). Thou`rt not like to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) now, and me so nigh her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>).

<p/>Thou know`st - poor, patient, suff`rin, dear - how thou didst work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>), A muddle! Aw a muddle!' Louisa approached him (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), lying with his (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) face turned up to the night sky. <div class="bookquote">`

Following his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was gazing at a star. <div class="bookquote">`

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Louisa hearing what he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, bent over him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) on the opposite side to Rachael, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Rachael</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You ha'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>heard?' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, after a few moments' silence. <div class="bookquote">` I ha'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>not forgot you, ledy.' <div class="bookquote">` Yes, Stephen, I have heard you.

<p/>The bearers being now ready to carry him (<font color='blue'><b>yo</b></font>) away, and the surgeon being anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) removal, those who had torches or lanterns, prepared to go in front of the litter.
<p/>Before it was raised, and while they were arranging how to go, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) said to Rachael, looking upward at the star: <div class="bookquote">`Often as I coom to myseln, and found it shinin'  (<font color='red'><b>Rachael/RACHAEL</b></font>)</div>on me down there in my trouble
<p/>t.' , I thowt it were the star as guided to Our Saviour's home. I awmust think it be the very star!'
<p/>They lifted him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) up, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) was overjoyed to find that they were about to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) in the direction whither
<p/>the star seemed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Saviour</b></font>) to lead. <div class="bookquote">` Rachael, beloved lass! Don't let go my hand. We may walk toogether t`night, my dear!'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`I will hold thy hand, and keep beside thee, Stephen, all the way.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Bless thee! Will soombody be pleased to coover my face!'
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>They carried him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) very gently along the fields, and down the lanes, and over the wide landscape; Rachael always holding the hand in hers.
<p/>The star had shown him (<font color='blue'><b>Stephen</b></font>) where to find the God of the poor; and through humility, and sorrow, and forgiveness, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had gone to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) Redeemer's rest.
<p/>CHAPTER VII - WHELP-HUNTING BEFORE the ring formed round the Old Hell Shaft was broken, one figure had disappeared from within it.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) shadow had not stood near Louisa, who held her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father's arm, but in a retired place by themselves.
<p/>When Mr. Gradgrind was summoned to the couch, Sissy, attentive to all that happened, slipped behind that wicked shadow - a sight in the horror of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) face, if there had been eyes there for any sight but one - and whispered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) ear.
<p/>Very few whispers broke the mournful silence. It was soon a funeral procession. Without turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) conferred with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) a few moments, and vanished.
<p/>Thus the whelp had gone out of the circle before the people moved. When the father reached home, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sent a message to Mr. Bounderby's, desiring his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) son to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) directly.
<p/>The reply was, that Mr. Bounderby having missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) in the crowd, and seeing nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) since, had supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) to be at Stone Lodge. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I believe, father,'  (<font color='red'><b>Stone Lodge</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will not come back to town to-night.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>Mr. Gradgrind turned away, and said no more.
<p/>In the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) went down to the Bank himself as soon as it was opened, and seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) son's place empty -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had not the courage to look in at first-RRB- went back along the street to meet Mr. Bounderby on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) way there.
<p/>To whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) said that, for reasons he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would soon explain, but entreated not then to be asked for, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) had found it necessary to employ his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) son at a distance for a little while.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby quite confounded, stood stock-still in the street after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) father-in-law had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), swelling like an immense soap-bubble, without its beauty.
<p/>Also, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) was charged with the duty of vindicating Stephen Blackpool's memory, and declaring the thief. Mr. Gradgrind went home, locked himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) room, and kept it all that day.
<p/>When Sissy and Louisa tapped at his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) said, without opening it, <div class="bookquote">`Not now, my dears; in the evening.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>On their return in the evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`I am not able yet - to-morrow.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) ate nothing all day, and had no candle after dark; and they heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) walking to and fro late at night.
<p/>Aged and bent he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) looked, and quite bowed down; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) looked a wiser man, and a better man, than in the days when in this life he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) wanted nothing - but Facts.
<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) left the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) appointed a time for them to come to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>); and so, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) gray head drooping, went away. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>But, in the morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) appeared at breakfast at the usual hour, and took his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) usual place at the table. Dear father,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Louisa, when they kept their appointment, <div class="bookquote">`you have three young children left.
<p/>They will be different, I will be different yet, with Heaven's help.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hand to Sissy, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) meant with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) help too. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your wretched brother,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. <div class="bookquote">` Do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) had planned this robbery, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) went with you to the lodging?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>The poor man being about to leave the town, it came into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evil brain to cast suspicion on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?' `
<p/><div class="bookquote">` I fear so, father. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had wanted money very much, and had spent a great deal.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I think it must have flashed upon him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sat there, father.
<p/>For I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to go there with me. The visit did not originate with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had some conversation with the poor man.
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) afterwards, why he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had done so, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) made a plausible excuse; but since last night, father, and when I remember the circumstances by its light, I am afraid I can imagine too truly what passed between them.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) aside?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) out of the room.

 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>I fear, father,' hesitated Louisa, <div class="bookquote">`that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must have made some representation to Stephen Blackpool - perhaps in my name, perhaps in his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) own - which induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) to do in good faith and honesty, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) had never done before, and to wait about the Bank those two or three nights before he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) left the town.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Too plain!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/>` returned the father. <div class="bookquote">` Too plain!'  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shaded his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face, and remained silent for some moments. Recovering himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said: `And now, how is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be found?
<p/>In the few hours that I can possibly allow to elapse before I publish the truth, how is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be found by us, and only by us?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes to where she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stood, like a good fairy in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house, and said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful kindness, <div class="bookquote">`It is always you, my child!'  (<font color='red'><b>a fairy</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>We had our fears,'  (<font color='red'><b>a fairy</b></font>)</div>Sissy explained, glancing at Louisa, <div class="bookquote">`before yesterday; and when I saw you brought to the side of the litter last night, and heard what passed -LRB-being close to Rachael all the time-RRB-, I went to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) when no one saw, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), ``Don't look at me.
<p/>How is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be saved from justice? Ten thousand pounds could not effect it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Sissy has effected it, father.'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>See where your father is.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was in a tremble before I whispered to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) started and trembled more then, and said, ``Where can I go?
<p/>Escape at once, for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sake and your own! '' I have very little money, and I don't know who will hide me!
<p/>I have not forgotten where Mr. Sleary goes at this time of year, and I read of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) in a paper only the other day.
<p/>'' I thought of father's old circus. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to hurry there, and tell his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) name, and ask Mr. Sleary to hide him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) till I came.
<p/>'' I'll get to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) before the morning,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said. And I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) shrink away among the people.' <div class="bookquote">`Thank Heaven!'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>exclaimed his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It was the more hopeful as the town to which Sissy had directed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was within three hours'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>journey of Liverpool, whence he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could be swiftly dispatched to any part of the world.
<p/>But, caution being necessary in communicating with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) - for there was a greater danger every moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being suspected now, and nobody could be sure at heart but that Mr. Bounderby himself, in a bullying vein of public zeal, might play a Roman part
<p/>- it was consented that Sissy and Louisa should repair to the place in question, by a circuitous course, alone; and that the unhappy father, setting forth in an opposite direction, should get round to the same bourne by another and wider route.
<p/>It was further agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should not present himself to Mr. Sleary, lest his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) intentions should be mistrusted, or the intelligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) arrival should cause his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) son to take flight anew; but, that the communication should be left to Sissy and Louisa to open; and that they should inform the cause of so much misery and disgrace, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) father's being at hand and of the purpose for which they had come.
<p/>When these arrangements had been well considered and were fully understood by all three, it was time to begin to carry them into execution.
<p/>Early in the afternoon, Mr. Gradgrind walked direct from his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) own house into the country, to be taken up on the line by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) was to travel; and at night the remaining two set forth upon their different course, encouraged by not seeing any face they knew.
<p/>The two travelled all night, except when they were left, for odd numbers of minutes, at branch-places, up illimitable flights of steps, or down wells - which was the only variety of those branches - and, early in the morning, were turned out on a swamp, a mile or two from the town they sought.
<p/>From this dismal spot they were rescued by a savage old postilion, who happened to be up early, kicking a horse in a fly: and so were smuggled into the town by all the back lanes where the pigs lived: which, although not a magnificent or even savoury approach, was, as is usual in such cases, the legitimate highway.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) may be got abroad yet.' The first thing they saw on entering the town was the skeleton of Sleary's Circus.
<p/>The company had departed for another town more than twenty miles off, and had opened there last night. The connection between the two places was by a hilly turnpike-road, and the travelling on that road was very slow.
<p/>Though they took but a hasty breakfast, and no rest -LRB-which it would have been in vain to seek under such anxious circumstances-RRB-, it was noon before they began to find the bills of Sleary's Horse-riding on barns and walls, and one o'clock when they stopped in the market-place.
<p/>A Grand Morning Performance by the Riders, commencing at that very hour, was in course of announcement by the bellman as they set their feet upon the stones of the street.
<p/>Sissy recommended that, to avoid making inquiries and attracting attention in the town, they should present themselves to pay at the door.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Riders</b></font>) were not, he (<font color='blue'><b>Riders</b></font>) would be sure to see them inside; and, knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Riders</b></font>) had done with the fugitive, would proceed with discretion still.
<p/>If Mr. Sleary were taking the money, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) would be sure to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>), and would proceed with discretion. Therefore, they repaired, with fluttering hearts, to the well- remembered booth.
<p/>The flag with the inscription SLEARY'S HORSE- RIDING was there; and the Gothic niche was there; but Mr. Sleary was not there.
<p/>Master Kidderminster, grown too maturely turfy to be received by the wildest credulity as Cupid any more, had yielded to the invincible force of circumstances -LRB-and his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) beard-RRB-, and, in the capacity of a man who made himself generally useful, presided on this occasion over the exchequer - having also a drum in reserve, on which to expend his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) leisure moments and superfluous forces.
<p/>In the extreme sharpness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Cupid</b></font>) look out for base coin, Mr. Kidderminster, as at present situated, never saw anything but money; so Sissy passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) unrecognised, and they went in.
<p/>The Emperor of Japan, on a steady old white horse stencilled with black spots, was twirling five wash-hand basins at once, as it is the favourite recreation of that monarch to do.
<p/>Sissy, though well acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>monarch</b></font>) Royal line, had no personal knowledge of the present Emperor, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Emperor</b></font>) reign was peaceful.
<p/>Miss Josephine Sleary, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) celebrated graceful Equestrian Tyrolean Flower Act, was then announced by a new clown -LRB-who humorously said Cauliflower Act-RRB-, and Mr. Sleary appeared, leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) in.
<p/>Mr. Sleary had only made one cut at the Clown with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) long whip- lash, and the Clown had only said, <div class="bookquote">`If you do it again, I'll throw the horse at you!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Clown</b></font>)</div><p/>But they got through the Act with great self-possession; and Mr. Sleary, saving for the first instant, conveyed no more expression into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) locomotive eye than into his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) fixed one.
<p/>The performance seemed a little long to Sissy and Louisa, particularly when it stopped to afford the Clown an opportunity of telling Mr. Sleary -LRB-who said <div class="bookquote">`Indeed, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div>to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) observations in the calmest way, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) eye on the house-RRB- about two legs sitting on three legs looking at one leg, when in came four legs, and laid hold of one leg, and up got two legs, caught hold of three legs, and threw 'em at four legs, who ran away with one leg.
<p/>For, although an ingenious Allegory relating to a butcher, a three- legged stool, a dog, and a leg of mutton, this narrative consumed time; and they were in great suspense.
<p/>At last, however, little fair-haired Josephine made her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) curtsey amid great applause; and the Clown, left alone in the ring, had just warmed himself, and said, <div class="bookquote">`Now I'll have a turn!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Clown</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>) took Louisa with her (<font color='blue'><b>Josephine</b></font>); and they were received by Mr. Sleary in a very little private apartment, with canvas sides, a grass floor, and a wooden ceiling all aslant, on which the box company stamped their approbation, as if they were coming through.
<p/>when Sissy was recognised both by father and daughter. when Sissy was touched on the shoulder, and beckoned out. <div class="bookquote">`Thethilia,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Sleary, who had brandy and water at hand, <div class="bookquote">`it doth me good to thee you.

<p/>These various changes, Mr. Sleary, very short of breath now, related with great heartiness, and with a wonderful kind of innocence, considering what a bleary and brandy-and-watery old veteran he (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) was.
<p/>Afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>veteran</b></font>) brought in Josephine, and E. W. B. Childers -LRB-rather deeply lined in the jaws by daylight-RRB-, and the Little Wonder of Scholastic Equitation, and in a word, all the company.
<p/>Amazing creatures they were in Louisa's eyes, so white and pink of complexion, so scant of dress, and so demonstrative of leg; but it was very agreeable to see them crowding about Sissy, and very natural in Sissy to be unable to refrain from tears. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>I'll thtand by the Thquire. Your brother ith one them black thervanth.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Louisa uttered an exclamation, partly of distress, partly of satisfaction. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Ith a fact,'  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Miss Louisa/LOUISA</b></font>)</div>said Sleary, <div class="bookquote">`and even knowin'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div>it, you couldn't put your finger on him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>).

<p/>Let the Thquire come here after the performanth, or come here yourthelf after the performanth, and you thall find your brother, and have the whole plathe to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in.
<p/>I thant undreth him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), nor yet wath hith paint off. Never mind the lookth of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), ath long ath he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)`th well hid.'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) love for her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) brother, with her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) eyes full of tears; and she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) and Sissy went away until later in the afternoon.
<p/>Louisa, with many thanks and with a lightened load, detained Mr. Sleary no longer then. Mr. Gradgrind arrived within an hour afterwards.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) too had encountered no one whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) knew; and was now sanguine with Sleary's assistance, of getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) disgraced son to Liverpool in the night.
<p/>As neither of the three could be his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) companion without almost identifying him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) under any disguise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) prepared a letter to a correspondent whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) could trust, beseeching him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) to ship the bearer off at any cost, to North or South America, or any distant part of the world to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) could be the most speedily and privately dispatched.
<p/>This done, they walked about, waiting for the Circus to be quite vacated; not only by the audience, but by the company and by the horses.
<p/>After watching it a long time, they saw Mr. Sleary bring out a chair and sit down by the side-door, smoking; as if that were his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) signal that they might approach. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Your thervant, Thquire,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) cautious salutation as they passed in. <div class="bookquote">` If you want me you'll find me here. You muthn't mind your thon having a comic livery on.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They all three went in; and Mr. Gradgrind sat down forlorn, on the Clown's performing chair in the middle of the ring.
<p/>On one of the back benches, remote in the subdued light and the strangeness of the place, sat the villainous whelp, sulky to the last, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) had the misery to call his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) son.
<p/>In a preposterous coat, like a beadle's, with cuffs and flaps exaggerated to an unspeakable extent; in an immense waistcoat, knee-breeches, buckled shoes, and a mad cocked hat; with nothing fitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>), and everything of coarse material, moth-eaten and full of holes; with seams in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) black face, where fear and heat had started through the greasy composition daubed all over it; anything so grimly, detestably, ridiculously shameful as the whelp in his (<font color='blue'><b>Clown</b></font>) comic livery, Mr. Gradgrind never could by any other means have believed in, weighable and measurable fact though it was.
<p/>And one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) model children had come to this! At first the whelp would not draw any nearer, but persisted in remaining up there by himself.
<p/>Yielding at length, if any concession so sullenly made can be called yielding, to the entreaties of Sissy - for Louisa he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) disowned altogether - he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) came down, bench by bench, until he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) stood in the sawdust, on the verge of the circle, as far as possible, within its limits from where his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) father sat. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>How was this done?'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>asked the father. <div class="bookquote">` How was what done?'  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>moodily answered the son. <div class="bookquote">` This robbery,'  (<font color='red'><b>the son</b></font>)</div>said the father, raising his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) voice upon the word. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I forced the safe myself over night, and shut it up ajar before I went away. I had had the key that was found, made long before.
<p/>I dropped it that morning, that it might be supposed to have been used. I didn't take the money all at once.
<p/>I pretended to put my balance away every night, but I didn't. Now you know all about it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` If a thunderbolt had fallen on me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>said the father, <div class="bookquote">`it would have shocked me less than this!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` I don't see why,'  (<font color='red'><b>the father</b></font>)</div>grumbled the son. ` So many people are employed in situations of trust; so many people, out of so many, will be dishonest.
<p/>I have heard you talk, a hundred times, of its being a law. How can I help laws? You have comforted others with such things, father.
<p/>The father buried his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) face in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hands, and the son stood in his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) disgraceful grotesqueness, biting straw: his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) hands, with the black partly worn away inside, looking like the hands of a monkey.
<p/>The evening was fast closing in; and from time to time, he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) turned the whites of his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) eyes restlessly and impatiently towards his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) father.
<p/>They were the only parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>) face that showed any life or expression, the pigment upon it was so thick. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Comfort yourself!'  (<font color='red'><b>Liverpool</b></font>)</div>You must be got to Liverpool, and sent abroad.' <div class="bookquote">` I suppose I must. I can't be more miserable anywhere,'  (<font color='red'><b>Liverpool</b></font>)</div>whimpered the whelp, `than I have been here, ever since I can remember.
<p/>Mr. Gradgrind went to the door, and returned with Sleary, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) submitted the question, How to get this deplorable object away? <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>That's one thing.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Why, I've been thinking of it, Thquire. There`th not muth time to lothe, tho you muth thay yeth or no.

<p/>That train will take him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) right to Liverpool.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>groaned Mr. Gradgrind. ` Will any coach - ` <div class="bookquote">`I don't mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) thould go in the comic livery,'  (<font color='red'><b>any coach</b></font>)</div>said Sleary. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Thay the word, and I'll make a Jothkin of him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>), out of the wardrobe, in five minutes.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I don't understand,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind. `
<p/>A Jothkin - a Carter. Make up your mind quick, Thquire. There'll be beer to feth. I've never met with nothing but beer
<p/>Mr. Gradgrind rapidly assented; Mr. Sleary rapidly turned out from a box, a smock frock, a felt hat, and other essentials; the whelp rapidly changed clothes behind a screen of baize; Mr. Sleary rapidly brought beer, and washed him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) white again. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>ath'll ever clean a comic blackamoor.'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Now,' said Sleary, <div class="bookquote">`come along to the coath, and jump up behind ; I'll go with you there, and they'll thuppothe you one of my people.
<p/>Thay farewell to your family, and tharp`th the word.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div>With which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) delicately retired. <div class="bookquote">` Here is your letter,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind.
<p/>Atone, by repentance and better conduct, for the shocking action you have committed, and the dreadful consequences to which it has led.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` All necessary means will be provided for you. Give me your hand, my poor boy, and may God forgive you as I do!'
 (<font color='red'><b>The culprit</b></font>)</div><p/>The culprit was moved to a few abject tears by these words and their pathetic tone. But, when Louisa opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>culprit</b></font>) repulsed her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) afresh. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Not you. I don't want to have anything to say to you!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` O Tom, Tom, do we end so, after all my love!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>Leaving old Bounderby to himself, and packing my best friend Mr. Harthouse off, and going home just when I was in the greatest danger.
<p/>Coming out with every word about our having gone to that place, when you saw the net was gathering round me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`After all your love!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) returned, obdurately. <div class="bookquote">` Pretty love! Pretty love that! Pretty love that! You have regularly given me up.
<p/>They all confusedly went out: Louisa crying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>), and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) still, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harthouse</b></font>) would one day be sorry to have left her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) so, and glad to think of these her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) last words, far away: when some one ran against them.
<p/>You never cared for me.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Tharp`th the word!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div>said Sleary, at the door. Mr. Gradgrind and Sissy, who were both before him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) while his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) sister yet clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) shoulder, stopped and recoiled.
<p/>For, there was Bitzer, out of breath, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) thin lips parted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) thin nostrils distended, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) white eyelashes quivering, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) colourless face more colourless than ever, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) ran himself into a white heat, when other people ran themselves into a glow.
<p/>There he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) stood, panting and heaving, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) had never stopped since the night, now long ago, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) had run them down before. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I'm sorry to interfere with your plans,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Bitzer, shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) head, <div class="bookquote">`but I can't allow myself to be done by horse-riders.
<p/>I must have young Mr. Tom; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) mustn't be got away by horse-riders; here he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) is in a smock frock, and I must have him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><p/>By the collar, too, it seemed. For, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took possession of him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). CHAPTER VIII - PHILOSOPHICAL THEY went back into the booth, Sleary shutting the door to keep intruders out.
<p/>Bitzer, still holding the paralysed culprit by the collar, stood in the Ring, blinking at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) old patron through the darkness of the twilight. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bitzer,'  (<font color='red'><b>patron</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, broken down, and miserably submissive to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`have you a heart?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` The circulation, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>returned Bitzer, smiling at the oddity of the question, <div class="bookquote">`couldn't be carried on without one.
<p/>No man, sir, acquainted with the facts established by Harvey relating to the circulation of the blood, can doubt that I have a heart.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Is it accessible,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`to any compassionate influence?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>It is accessible to Reason, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned the excellent young man. <div class="bookquote">` And to nothing else.'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>They stood looking at each other; Mr. Gradgrind's face as white as the pursuer's. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What motive - even what motive in reason - can you have for preventing the escape of this wretched youth,'  (<font color='red'><b>the pursuer</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`and crushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) miserable father?
<p/>Sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Bitzer, in a very business-like and logical manner, <div class="bookquote">`since you ask me what motive I have in reason, for taking young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, it is only reasonable to let you know.
<p/>See his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister here. Pity us!'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I have suspected young Mr. Tom of this bank-robbery from the first. I had had my eye upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) before that time, for I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ways.
<p/>I have kept my observations to myself, but I have made them; and I have got ample proofs against him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) now, besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) running away, and besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own confession, which I was just in time to overhear.
<p/>I had the pleasure of watching your house yesterday morning, and following you here. I am going to take young Mr. Tom back to Coketown, in order to deliver him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) over to Mr. Bounderby.
<p/>And I wish to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) situation, sir, for it will be a rise to me, and will do me good.'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir, I have no doubt whatever that Mr. Bounderby will then promote me to young Mr. Tom's situation. `If this is solely a question of self-interest with you - ` Mr. Gradgrind began. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>I beg your pardon for interrupting you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>returned Bitzer; <div class="bookquote">`but I am sure you know that the whole social system is a question of self-interest.
<p/>I was brought up in that catechism when I was very young, sir, as you are aware.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`What sum of money,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, <div class="bookquote">`will you set against your expected promotion?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div><p/>What you must always appeal to, is a person's self-interest. It's your only hold. We are so constituted. <div class="bookquote">`Thank you, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>returned Bitzer, <div class="bookquote">`for hinting at the proposal; but I will not set any sum against it.
<p/>Knowing that your clear head would propose that alternative, I have gone over the calculations in my mind; and I find that to compound a felony, even on very high terms indeed, would not be as safe and good for me as my improved prospects in the Bank.'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Bitzer,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gradgrind/Thomas/Gradgrind</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Gradgrind, stretching out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hands as though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) would have said, See how miserable I am! <div class="bookquote">` Bitzer, I have but one chance left to soften you.
<p/>If, in remembrance of the pains bestowed upon you there, you can persuade yourself in any degree to disregard your present interest and release my son, I entreat and pray you to give him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) the benefit of that remembrance.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You were many years at my school. I really wonder, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the pupil</b></font>)</div>rejoined the old pupil in an argumentative manner, <div class="bookquote">`to find you taking a position so untenable.
<p/>My schooling was paid for; it was a bargain; and when I came away, the bargain ended.'  (<font color='red'><b>the pupil</b></font>)</div>It was a fundamental principle of the Gradgrind philosophy that everything was to be paid for.
<p/>Nobody was ever on any account to give anybody anything, or render anybody help without purchase. Gratitude was to be abolished, and the virtues springing from it were not to be.
<p/>And if we didn't get to Heaven that way, it was not a politico-economical place, and we had no business there. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Every inch of the existence of mankind, from birth to death, was to be a bargain across a counter. I don't deny,'  (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div>added Bitzer, <div class="bookquote">`that my schooling was cheap.
<p/>But that comes right, sir. I was made in the cheapest market, and have to dispose of myself in the dearest.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Bitzer</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) was a little troubled here, by Louisa and Sissy crying. <div class="bookquote">` Pray don't do that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Sissy/Jupe/Sissy Jupe</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`it's of no use doing that: it only worries.
<p/>You seem to think that I have some animosity against young Mr. Tom; whereas I have none at all. I am only going, on the reasonable grounds I have mentioned, to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) back to Coketown.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was to resist, I should set up the cry of Stop thief! But, he (<font color='blue'><b>thief</b></font>) won't resist, you may depend upon it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Sleary, who with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) mouth open and his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) rolling eye as immovably jammed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) head as his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) fixed one, had listened to these doctrines with profound attention, here stepped forward. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>right and there`th no help for it. I can't conthent to do more, but I'll do that.' Fresh lamentations from Louisa, and deeper affliction on Mr. Gradgrind's part, followed this desertion of them by their last friend.
<p/>As they were all going out again, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) favoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) with one slight roll of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) movable eye, desiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) to linger behind.
<p/>But, Sissy glanced at him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) with great attention; nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) own breast misunderstand him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). As he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) locked the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said excitedly: <div class="bookquote">`The Thquire thtood by you, Thethilia, and I'll thtand by the Thquire.

<p/>The word was so sharp, that in ten minutes Mr. Childers, sauntering about the market-place in a pair of slippers, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Childers</b></font>) cue, and Mr. Sleary's equipage was ready.
<p/>It was a fine sight, to behold the learned dog barking round it, and Mr. Sleary instructing him (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>), with his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) one practicable eye, that Bitzer was the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) particular attentions.
<p/>Soon after dark they all three got in and started; the learned dog -LRB-a formidable creature-RRB- already pinning Bitzer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) eye, and sticking close to the wheel on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) side, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) might be ready for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bitzer</b></font>) showing the slightest disposition to alight.
<p/>Tharp`th the word!' The other three sat up at the inn all night in great suspense. At eight o'clock in the morning Mr. Sleary and the dog reappeared: both in high spirits. <div class="bookquote">`

<p/>Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) thought them far too slight, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) said, for such a service. <div class="bookquote">` Now, Thquire, if your daughter will ethcuthe me, I thould like one parting word with you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Louisa and Sissy withdrew into an adjoining room; Mr. Sleary, stirring and drinking his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) brandy and water as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) stood, went on: <div class="bookquote">`Thquire, - you don't need to be told that dogth ith wonderful animalth.'

<p/>We wath getting up our Children in the Wood one morning, when there cometh into our Ring, by the thtage door, a dog.

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Sleary/Sleary</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER IX - FINAL IT is a dangerous thing to see anything in the sphere of a vain blusterer, before the vain blusterer sees it himself.
<p/>Inappeasably indignant with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) triumphant discovery of Mrs. Pegler, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) turned this presumption, on the part of a woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dependent position, over and over in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) mind, until it accumulated with turning like a great snowball.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) made the discovery that to discharge this highly connected female - to have it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Sleary</b></font>) power to say, <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) was a woman of family, and wanted to stick to me, but I wouldn't have it, and got rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>)'  (<font color='red'><b>this female</b></font>)</div>- would be to get the utmost possible amount of crowning glory out of the connection, and at the same time to punish Mrs. Sparsit according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) deserts.
<p/>Filled fuller than ever, with this great idea, Mr. Bounderby came in to lunch, and sat himself down in the dining-room of former days, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) portrait was.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby felt that Mrs. Sparsit had audaciously anticipated him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), and presumed to be wiser than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>). Mrs. Sparsit sat by the fire, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) foot in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) cotton stirrup, little thinking whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) was posting.
<p/>Since the Pegler affair, this gentlewoman had covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) pity for Mr. Bounderby with a veil of quiet melancholy and contrition.
<p/>In virtue thereof, it had become her (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) habit to assume a woful look, which woful look she (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) now bestowed upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Pegler</b></font>) patron. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>What's the matter now, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>patron</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bounderby, in a very short, rough way. <div class="bookquote">` Pray, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`do not bite my nose off.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Bite your nose off, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` Your nose!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>meaning, as Mrs. Sparsit conceived, that it was too developed a nose for the purpose.
<p/>After which offensive implication, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) cut himself a crust of bread, and threw the knife down with a noise. Mrs. Sparsit took her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) foot out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) stirrup, and said, <div class="bookquote">`Mr. Bounderby, sir!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Well, ma'am?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>retorted Mr. Bounderby. <div class="bookquote">` What are you staring at?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` May I ask, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, <div class="bookquote">`have you been ruffled this morning?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">`May I inquire, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div>pursued the injured woman, <div class="bookquote">`whether I am the unfortunate cause of your having lost your temper?'  (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>A female may be highly connected, but she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) can't be permitted to bother and badger a man in my position, and I am not going to put up with it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the woman</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">` Yes, ma'am.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Now, I'll tell you what, ma'am,' said Bounderby, `I am not come here to be bullied. -LRB-Mr. Bounderby felt it necessary to get on:
<p/>foreseeing that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) allowed of details, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) would be beaten.-RRB- Mrs. Sparsit first elevated, then knitted, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) Coriolanian eyebrows; gathered up her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) work into its proper basket; and rose. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), majestically. <div class="bookquote">` It is apparent to me that I am in your way at present. I will retire to my own apartment.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>You had better allow me, ma'am,' said Bounderby, passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>), and getting his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) hand upon the lock; `because I can take the opportunity of saying a word to you, before you go.
<p/><div class="bookquote">`Allow me to open the door, ma'am.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Thank you, sir; I can do it for myself.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Mrs. Sparsit, ma'am, I rather think you are cramped here, do you know?
<p/>It appears to me, that, under my humble roof, there's hardly opening enough for a lady of your genius in other people's affairs.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Sparsit gave him (<font color='blue'><b>genius</b></font>) a look of the darkest scorn, and said with great politeness, <div class="bookquote">`Really, sir?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I have been thinking it over, you see, since the late affairs have happened, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby; `and it appears to my poor judgment - ` <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Oh! Pray, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Sparsit interposed, with sprightly cheerfulness, <div class="bookquote">`don't disparage your judgment. Everybody knows how unerring Mr. Bounderby's judgment is.
<p/>Everybody has had proofs of it. It must be the theme of general conversation. Disparage anything in yourself but your judgment, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Sparsit, laughing.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby, very red and uncomfortable, resumed: <div class="bookquote">`It appears to me, ma'am, I say, that a different sort of establishment altogether would bring out a lady of your powers.
<p/>Don't you think you might find some affairs there, ma'am, to interfere with?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`It never occurred to me before, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit; <div class="bookquote">`but now you mention it, should think it highly probable.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
<p/>Such an establishment as your relation, Lady Scadgers's, now. Then suppose you try, ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div>said Bounderby, laying an envelope with a cheque in it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Scadgers</b></font>) little basket. <div class="bookquote">`
<p/>You can take your own time for going, ma'am; but perhaps in the meanwhile, it will be more agreeable to a lady of your powers of mind, to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) meals by herself, and not to be intruded upon.
<p/>I really ought to apologise to you - being only Josiah Bounderby of Coketown - for having stood in your light so long.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bounderby/Bounderby/MR. BOUNDERBY</b></font>)</div><p/>If that portrait could speak, sir - but it has the advantage over the original of not possessing the power of committing itself and disgusting others, - it would testify, that a long period has elapsed since I first habitually addressed it as the picture of a Noodle.
<p/><div class="bookquote">` Pray don't name it, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Sparsit. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing that a Noodle does, can awaken surprise or indignation; the proceedings of a Noodle can only inspire contempt.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Sparsit/Sparsit</b></font>)</div><p/>Thus saying, Mrs. Sparsit, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) Roman features like a medal struck to commemorate her (<font color='blue'><b>Sparsit</b></font>) scorn of Mr. Bounderby, surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) fixedly from head to foot, swept disdainfully past him (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>), and ascended the staircase.
<p/>Mr. Bounderby closed the door, and stood before the fire; projecting himself after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) old explosive manner into his (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) portrait - and into futurity.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) saw Mrs. Sparsit fighting out a daily fight at the points of all the weapons in the female armoury, with the grudging, smarting, peevish, tormenting Lady Scadgers, still laid up in bed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Scadgers</b></font>) mysterious leg, and gobbling her (<font color='blue'><b>Scadgers</b></font>) insufficient income down by about the middle of every quarter, in a mean little airless lodging, a mere closet for one, a mere crib for two; but did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) see more?
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) catch any glimpse of himself making a show of Bitzer to strangers, as the rising young man, so devoted to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) master's great merits, who had won young Tom's place, and had almost captured young Tom himself, in the times when by various rascals he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was spirited away?
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) see any faint reflection of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby five-and-twenty Humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking upon himself the name, Josiah Bounderby of Coketown, should for ever dine in Bounderby Hall, for ever lodge in Bounderby buildings, for ever attend a Bounderby chapel, for ever go to sleep under a Bounderby chaplain, for ever be supported out of a Bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all healthy stomachs, with a vast amount of Bounderby balderdash and bluster?
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Bounderby</b></font>) any prescience of the day, five years to come, when Josiah Bounderby of Coketown was to die of a fit in the Coketown street, and this same precious will was to begin its long career of quibble, plunder, false pretences, vile example, little service and much law?
<p/>Into how much of futurity? Probably not. Yet the portrait was to see it all out. Here was Mr. Gradgrind on the same day, and in the same hour, sitting thoughtful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) own room.
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) see himself, a white-haired decrepit man, bending his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) hitherto inflexible theories to appointed circumstances; making his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) facts and figures subservient to Faith, Hope, and Charity; and no longer trying to grind that Heavenly trio in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) dusty little mills?
<p/>How much of futurity did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) see? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) catch sight of himself, therefore much despised by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) late political associates?
<p/>Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gradgrind</b></font>) see them, in the era of its being quite settled that the national dustmen have only to do with one another, and owe no duty to an abstraction called a People, <div class="bookquote">`taunting the honourable gentleman'  (<font color='red'><b>a People</b></font>)</div>with this and with that and with what not, five nights a-week, until the small hours of the morning?
<p/>Here was Louisa on the night of the same day, watching the fire as in days of yore, though with a gentler and a humbler face.
<p/>Broadsides in the streets, signed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father's name, exonerating the late Stephen Blackpool, weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) own son, with such extenuation as his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) years and temptation -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) could not bring himself to add, his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) education-RRB- might beseech; were of the Present.
<p/>So, Stephen Blackpool's tombstone, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father's record of his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) death, was almost of the Present, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) knew it was to be.
<p/>Probably he (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) had that much foreknowledge, knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Blackpool</b></font>) men. How much of the future might arise before her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) vision? These things she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could plainly see.
<p/>A working woman, christened Rachael, after a long illness once again appearing at the ringing of the Factory bell, and passing to and fro at the set hours, among the Coketown Hands; a woman of pensive beauty, always dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene, and even cheerful; who, of all the people in the place, alone appeared to have compassion on a degraded, drunken wretch of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own sex, who was sometimes seen in the town secretly begging of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and crying to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); a woman working, ever working, but content to do it, and preferring to do it as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) natural lot, until she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) should be too old to labour any more?
<p/>A lonely brother, many thousands of miles away, writing, on paper blotted with tears, that her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) words had too soon come true, and that all the treasures in the world would be cheaply bartered for a sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dear face?
<p/>At length this brother coming nearer home, with hope of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and being delayed by illness; and then a letter, in a strange hand, saying <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) died in hospital, of fever, such a day, and died in penitence and love of you: his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) last word being your name' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>?
<p/>But, how much of the Future? Did Louisa see this? Such a thing was to be. Did Louisa see these things?
<p/>Herself again a wife - a mother - lovingly watchful of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) children, ever careful that they should have a childhood of the mind no less than a childhood of the body, as knowing it to be even a more beautiful thing, and a possession, any hoarded scrap of which, is a blessing and happiness to the wisest?
<p/>But, happy Sissy's happy children loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>); all children loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>), grown learned in childish lore; thinking no innocent and pretty fancy ever to be despised; trying hard to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) humbler fellow-creatures, and to beautify their lives of machinery and reality with those imaginative graces and delights, without which the heart of infancy will wither up, the sturdiest physical manhood will be morally stark death, and the plainest national prosperity figures can show, will be the Writing on the Wall, -
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Sissy</b></font>) holding this course as part of no fantastic vow, or bond, or brotherhood, or sisterhood, or pledge, or covenant, or fancy dress, or fancy fair; but simply as a duty to be done, - did Louisa see these things of herself?
<p/>Such things were to be. Did Louisa see this? Such a thing was never to be. These things were to be.
<p/>Dear reader! It rests with you and me, whether, in our two fields of action, similar things shall be or not.
<p/>Let them be! We shall sit with lighter bosoms on the hearth, to see the ashes of our fires turn gray and cold.
