This article is about the novel.
Jane Eyre /ɛər/ (originally published as Jane Eyre: An Autobiography) is novel by English writer Charlotte Brontë, published under the pen name "Currer Bell", on October by Smith, Elder Co. of London.
The first American edition was published the following year by Harper Brothers of New York.
Jane Eyre follows the experiences of its eponymous heroine, including her growth to adulthood and her love for Mr. Rochester, the brooding master of Thornfield Hall.
The novel revolutionised prose fiction by being the first to focus on its protagonist moral and spiritual development through an intimate first person narrative, where actions and events are coloured by psychological intensity.
Charlotte Brontë has been called the "first historian of the private consciousness", and the literary ancestor of writers like Proust and Joyce.
The book contains elements of social criticism, with strong sense of Christian morality at its core, and is considered by many to be ahead of its time because of Jane individualistic character and how the novel approaches the topics of class, sexuality, religion and feminism.
Jane Eyre is divided into chapters.
It was originally published in three volumes in the century, comprising chapters to to and to .
The second edition was dedicated to William Makepeace Thackeray.

The novel is first person narrative from the perspective of the title character.
The novel setting is somewhere in the north of England, late in the reign of George III (–).
It goes through five distinct stages: Jane childhood at Gateshead Hall, where she is emotionally and physically abused by her aunt and cousins; her education at Lowood School, where she gains friends and role models but suffers privations and oppression; her time as governess at Thornfield Hall, where she falls in love with her mysterious employer, Edward Fairfax Rochester; her time in the Moor House, during which her earnest but cold clergyman cousin, St. John Rivers, proposes to her; and ultimately her reunion with, and marriage to, her beloved Rochester.
Throughout these sections, the novel provides perspectives on number of important social issues and ideas, many of which are critical of the status quo.
Young Jane argues with her guardian Mrs. Reed of Gateshead, illustration by F. H. Townsend
Jane Eyre, aged lives with her maternal uncle family, the Reeds, as result of her uncle dying wish.
It is several years after her parents died of typhus.
Mr. Reed, Jane uncle, was the only member of the Reed family who was ever kind to Jane.
Jane aunt, Sarah Reed, dislikes her, abuses her, and treats her as burden, and discourages her children from associating with Jane.
The nursemaid, Bessie, proves to be Jane only ally in the household, even though Bessie occasionally scolds Jane harshly.
Excluded from the family activities, Jane leads an unhappy childhood, with only doll and books with which to entertain herself.
One day, as punishment for defending herself against her cousin John Reed, Jane is relegated to the red room in which her late uncle had died; there, she faints from panic after she thinks she has seen his ghost.
The red room is significant because it lays the grounds for the "ambiguous relationship between parents and children" which plays out in all of Jane future relationships with male figures throughout the novel.
She is subsequently attended to by the kindly apothecary Mr. Lloyd to whom Jane reveals how unhappy she is living at Gateshead Hall.
He recommends to Mrs. Reed that Jane should be sent to school, an idea Mrs. Reed happily supports.
Mrs. Reed then enlists the aid of the harsh Mr. Brocklehurst, who is the director of Lowood Institution, charity school for girls, to enroll Jane.
Mrs. Reed cautions Mr. Brocklehurst that Jane has "tendency for deceit", which he interprets as her being "liar".
Before Jane leaves, however, she confronts Mrs. Reed and declares that she'll never call her "aunt" again.
Jane also tells Mrs. Reed and her daughters, Georgiana and Eliza, that they are the ones who are deceitful, and that she will tell everyone at Lowood how cruelly the Reeds treated her.
At Lowood Institution, school for poor and orphaned girls, Jane soon finds that life is harsh; she attempts to fit in and befriends an older girl, Helen Burns.
During class session, her new friend looks back at Jane and is caught, which provokes lashing.
As Mr. Brocklehurst enters just prior to the lashing, then permits it to take place, Jane drops her slate which causes loud crash and breaks it, thereby drawing attention to herself.
She is then forced to stand on stool with no food nor water and is called "sinner".
The other girls are told not to engage with her as she is liar.
Miss Temple, the caring superintendent, facilitates Jane self defence.
Helen and Miss Temple are Jane two main role models who positively guide her development, despite the harsh treatment she has received from many others.
The pupils at Lowood are subjected to cold rooms, poor meals, and thin clothing.
Many students fall ill when typhus epidemic strikes; Helen dies of consumption in Jane arms.
When Mr. Brocklehurst maltreatment of the students is discovered, several benefactors erect new building and install sympathetic management committee to moderate Mr. Brocklehurst harsh rule.
Conditions at the school then improve dramatically.
The name Lowood symbolises the "low" point in Jane life where she was maltreated.
After six years as student and two as teacher at Lowood, Jane decides to leave in pursuit of new life, growing bored of her life at Lowood.
Her friend and confidante, Miss Temple, also leaves after getting married.
She advertises her services as governess.
A housekeeper at Thornfield Hall, Alice Fairfax, replies to Jane advertisement.
Jane takes the position, teaching Adèle Varens, young French girl.
One night, while Jane is walking to nearby town, horseman passes her.
The horse slips on ice and throws the rider.
Despite the rider surliness, Jane helps him get back onto his horse.
Later, back at Thornfield, she learns that this man is Edward Rochester, master of the house.
Adèle was left in his care when her mother abandoned her.
It is not immediately apparent whether Adèle is Rochester daughter or not.
At Jane first meeting with Mr. Rochester, he teases her, accusing her of bewitching his horse to make him fall.
Jane is able to stand up to his initially arrogant manner, despite his strange behaviour.
Mr. Rochester and Jane soon come to enjoy each other company, and spend many evenings together.
Odd things start to happen at the house, such as strange laugh being heard, mysterious fire in Mr. Rochester room (from which Jane saves Rochester by rousing him and throwing water on him and the fire), and an attack on house guest named Mr. Mason.
After Jane saves Mr. Rochester from the fire, he thanks her tenderly and emotionally, and that night Jane feels strange emotions of her own towards him.
The next day however he leaves unexpectedly for distant party gathering, and several days later returns with the whole party, including the beautiful and talented Blanche Ingram.
Jane sees that Blanche and Mr. Rochester favour each other and starts to feel jealous, particularly because she also sees that Blanche is snobbish and heartless.
Jane then receives word that Mrs. Reed has suffered stroke and is calling for her.
Jane returns to Gateshead and remains there for month to attend her dying aunt.
Mrs. Reed confesses to Jane that she wronged her, bringing forth letter from Jane paternal uncle, Mr. John Eyre, in which he asks for her to live with him and be his heir.
Mrs. Reed admits to telling Mr. Eyre that Jane had died of fever at Lowood.
Soon afterward, Mrs. Reed dies, and Jane helps her cousins after the funeral before returning to Thornfield.

Back at Thornfield, Jane broods over Mr. Rochester rumoured impending marriage to Blanche Ingram.
However, one midsummer evening, Rochester baits Jane by saying how much he will miss her after getting married and how she will soon forget him.
The normally self controlled Jane reveals her feelings for him.
Rochester then is sure that Jane is sincerely in love with him, and he proposes marriage.
Jane is at first skeptical of his sincerity, before accepting his proposal.
She then writes to her Uncle John, telling him of her happy news.
As she prepares for her wedding, Jane forebodings arise when strange woman sneaks into her room one night and rips her wedding veil in two.
As with the previous mysterious events, Mr. Rochester attributes the incident to Grace Poole, one of his servants.
During the wedding ceremony however, Mr. Mason and lawyer declare that Mr. Rochester cannot marry because he is already married to Mr. Mason sister, Bertha.
Mr. Rochester admits this is true but explains that his father tricked him into the marriage for her money.
Once they were united, he discovered that she was rapidly descending into congenital madness, and so he eventually locked her away in Thornfield, hiring Grace Poole as nurse to look after her.
When Grace gets drunk, Rochester wife escapes and causes the strange happenings at Thornfield.
It turns out that Jane uncle, Mr. John Eyre, is friend of Mr. Mason and was visited by him soon after Mr. Eyre received Jane letter about her impending marriage.
After the marriage ceremony is broken off, Mr. Rochester asks Jane to go with him to the south of France, and live with him as husband and wife, even though they cannot be married.
Refusing to go against her principles, and despite her love for him, Jane leaves Thornfield in the middle of the night.
Jane travels as far from Thornfield as she can using the little money she had previously saved.
She accidentally leaves her bundle of possessions on the coach and is forced to sleep on the moor.
She unsuccessfully attempts to trade her handkerchief and gloves for food.
Exhausted and starving, she eventually makes her way to the home of Diana and Mary Rivers, but is turned away by the housekeeper.
She collapses on the doorstep, preparing for her death.
St. John Rivers, Diana and Mary brother and clergyman, rescues her.
After she regains her health, St. John finds Jane teaching position at nearby village school.
Jane becomes good friends with the sisters, but St. John remains aloof.
The sisters leave for governess jobs, and St. John becomes somewhat closer to Jane.
St. John learns Jane true identity and astounds her by telling her that her uncle, John Eyre, has died and left her his entire fortune of pounds (equivalent to just under million in ).
When Jane questions him further, St. John reveals that John Eyre is also his and his sisters' uncle.
They had once hoped for share of the inheritance but were left virtually nothing.
Jane, overjoyed by finding that she has living and friendly family members, insists on sharing the money equally with her cousins, and Diana and Mary come back to live at Moor House.
Thinking that the pious Jane will make suitable missionary wife, St. John asks her to marry him and to go with him to India, not out of love, but out of duty.
Jane initially accepts going to India but rejects the marriage proposal, suggesting they travel as brother and sister.
As soon as Jane resolve against marriage to St. John begins to weaken, she mystically hears Mr. Rochester voice calling her name.
Jane then returns to Thornfield to find only blackened ruins.
She learns that Mr. Rochester wife set the house on fire and committed suicide by jumping from the roof.
In his rescue attempts, Mr. Rochester lost hand and his eyesight.
Jane reunites with him, but he fears that she will be repulsed by his condition.
Very, sir; you always were, you know", she replies.
When Jane assures him of her love and tells him that she will never leave him, Mr. Rochester proposes again, and they are married.
He eventually recovers sight enough to see their newborn son.

She is supervised and cared for by Grace Poole, whose drinking sometimes allows Bertha to escape.
After Richard Mason puts an end to Jane and Mr. Rochester wedding, Rochester finally introduces Jane to Bertha: "In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, figure ran backwards and forwards.

The early sequences, in which Jane is sent to Lowood, harsh boarding school, are derived from the author own experiences.
Helen Burns death from tuberculosis (referred to as consumption) recalls the deaths of Charlotte Brontë sisters, Elizabeth and Maria, who died of the disease in childhood as result of the conditions at their school, the Clergy Daughters School at Cowan Bridge, near Tunstall, Lancashire.
Mr. Brocklehurst is based on Rev.
William Carus Wilson the Evangelical minister who ran the school.
Additionally, John Reed decline into alcoholism and dissolution recalls the life of Charlotte brother Branwell, who became an opium and alcohol addict in the years preceding his death.
Finally, like Jane, Charlotte became governess.
These facts were revealed to the public in The Life of Charlotte Brontë by Charlotte friend and fellow novelist Elizabeth Gaskell.
The Gothic manor of Thornfield Hall was probably inspired by North Lees Hall, near Hathersage in the Peak District.
This was visited by Charlotte Brontë and her friend Ellen Nussey in the summer of and is described by the latter in letter dated July .
It was the residence of the Eyre family, and its first owner, Agnes Ashurst, was reputedly confined as lunatic in padded second floor room.
It has been suggested that the Wycoller Hall in Lancashire, close to Haworth, provided the setting for Ferndean Manor to which Mr. Rochester retreats after the fire at Thornfield: there are similarities between the owner of Ferndean, Mr. Rochester father, and Henry Cunliffe who inherited Wycoller in the and lived there until his death in one of Cunliffe relatives was named Elizabeth Eyre (née Cunliffe).
The sequence in which Mr. Rochester wife sets fire to the bed curtains was prepared in an August homemade publication of Brontë The Young Men Magazine, Number .
Charlotte Brontë began composing Jane Eyre in Manchester, and she likely envisioned Manchester Cathedral churchyard as the burial place for Jane parents and the birthplace of Jane herself.

Jane Eyre initial reception contrasts starkly to its reputation today.
In Elizabeth Rigby (later Elizabeth Eastlake), reviewing Jane Eyre in The Quarterly Review, found it "pre eminently an anti Christian composition," declaring: "We do not hesitate to say that the tone of mind and thought which has overthrown authority and violated every code human and divine abroad, and fostered Chartism and rebellion at home, is the same which has also written Jane Eyre.
