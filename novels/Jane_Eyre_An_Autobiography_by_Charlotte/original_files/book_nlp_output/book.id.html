<p/>Charlotte Bronte Language: English ccx074@pglaf.org JANE EYRE AN AUTOBIOGRAPHY BY CHARLOTTE BRONTE ILLUSTRATED BY F. H. TOWNSEND London SERVICE & PATON
<p/>5 HENRIETTA STREET 1897 The Illustrations SERVICE & PATON, London TO W. M. THACKERAY, ESQ. , This Work IS RESPECTFULLY INSCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR PREFACE
<p/>A preface to the first edition of <div class="bookquote">``Jane Eyre''  (<font color='red'><b>M.</b></font>)</div>being unnecessary , I gave none: this second edition demands a few words both of acknowledgment and miscellaneous remark.
<p/>My thanks are due in three quarters. To the Public, for the indulgent ear it has inclined to a plain tale with few pretensions.
<p/>To my Publishers, for the aid their tact, their energy, their practical sense and frank liberality have afforded an unknown and unrecommended Author.
<p/>The Press and the Public are but vague personifications for me, and I must thank them in vague terms; but my Publishers are definite: so are certain generous critics who have encouraged me as only large-hearted and high-minded men know how to encourage a struggling stranger; to them, i.e. , to my Publishers and the select Reviewers
<p/>To the Press, for the fair field its honest suffrage has opened to an obscure aspirant. , I say cordially, Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart.
<p/>Having thus acknowledged what I owe those who have aided and approved me, I turn to another class; a small one, so far as I know, but not, therefore, to be overlooked.
<p/>I mean the timorous or carping few who doubt the tendency of such books as <div class="bookquote">``Jane Eyre:''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in whose eyes whatever is unusual is wrong; whose ears detect in each protest against bigotry--that parent of crime--an insult to piety, that regent of God on earth.
<p/>I would suggest to such doubters certain obvious distinctions; I would remind them of certain simple truths. Conventionality is not morality.
<p/>To pluck the mask from the face of the Pharisee, is not to lift an impious hand to the Crown of Thorns.
<p/>Self-righteousness is not religion. To attack the first is not to assail the last. These things and deeds are diametrically opposed: they are as distinct as is vice from virtue.
<p/>Men too often confound them: they should not be confounded: appearance should not be mistaken for truth; narrow human doctrines, that only tend to elate and magnify a few, should not be substituted for the world-redeeming creed of Christ.
<p/>I repeat it--a difference; and it is a good, and not a bad action to mark broadly and clearly the line of separation between them.
<p/>The world may not like to see these ideas dissevered, for it has been accustomed to blend them; finding it convenient to make external show pass for sterling worth--to let white-washed walls vouch for clean shrines.
<p/>It may hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) who dares to scrutinise and expose--to rase the gilding, and show base metal under it--to penetrate the sepulchre, and reveal charnel relics: but hate as it will, it is indebted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>).
<p/>Ahab did not like Micaiah, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) never prophesied good concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>), but evil; probably he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) liked the sycophant son of Chenaannah better; yet might Ahab have escaped a bloody death, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) but stopped his (<font color='blue'><b>Christ</b></font>) ears to flattery, and opened them to faithful counsel.
<p/>There is a man in our own days whose words are not framed to tickle delicate ears: who, to my thinking, comes before the great ones of society, much as the son of Imlah came before the throned Kings of Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth as deep, with a power as prophet-like and as vital--a mien as dauntless and as daring.
<p/>I cannot tell; but I think if some of those amongst whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Judah</b></font>) hurls the Greek fire of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judah</b></font>) sarcasm, and over whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Judah</b></font>) flashes the levin-brand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Judah</b></font>) denunciation, were to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Judah</b></font>) warnings in time--they or their seed might yet escape a fatal Rimoth-Gilead.
<p/>I have alluded to him (<font color='blue'><b>Judah</b></font>), Reader, because I think I see in him (<font color='blue'><b>Judah</b></font>) an intellect profounder and more unique than his (<font color='blue'><b>Judah</b></font>) contemporaries have yet recognised; because I regard him (<font color='blue'><b>Judah</b></font>) as the first social regenerator of the day--as the very master of that working corps who would restore to rectitude the warped system of things; because I think no commentator on his (<font color='blue'><b>commentator</b></font>) writings has yet found the comparison that suits him (<font color='blue'><b>commentator</b></font>), the terms which rightly characterise his (<font color='blue'><b>commentator</b></font>) talent.
<p/>There is-- Is the satirist of <div class="bookquote">``Vanity Fair''  (<font color='red'><b>the satirist</b></font>)</div>admired in high places? Why have I alluded to this man? They say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is like Fielding: they talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wit, humour, comic powers.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wit is bright, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) humour attractive, but both bear the same relation to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) serious genius that the mere lambent sheet-lightning playing under the edge of the summer- cloud does to the electric death-spark hid in its womb.
<p/>Finally, I have alluded to Mr. Thackeray, because to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thackeray</b></font>)--if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thackeray</b></font>) will accept the tribute of a total stranger--I have dedicated this second edition of <div class="bookquote">``JANE EYRE.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thackeray</b></font>) resembles Fielding as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop on carrion, but Thackeray never does. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>CURRER BELL.
<p/>I avail myself of the opportunity which a third edition of <div class="bookquote">``Jane Eyre''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>affords me, of again addressing a word to the Public, to explain that my claim to the title of novelist rests on this one work alone.
<p/>If, therefore, the authorship of other works of fiction has been attributed to me, an honour is awarded where it is not merited; and consequently, denied where it is justly due.
<p/>December 21 st , 1847. NOTE TO THE THIRD EDITION This explanation will serve to rectify mistakes which may already have been made, and to prevent future errors.
<p/>We had been wandering, indeed, in the leafless shrubbery an hour in the morning; but since dinner -LRB-Mrs. Reed, when there was no company, dined early-RRB- the cold winter wind had brought with it clouds so sombre, and a rain so penetrating, that further out-door exercise was now out of the question.
<p/>I was glad of it: I never liked long walks, especially on chilly afternoons: dreadful to me was the coming home in the raw twilight, with nipped fingers and toes, and a heart saddened by the chidings of Bessie, the nurse, and humbled by the consciousness of my physical inferiority to Eliza, John, and Georgiana Reed.
<p/>The said Eliza, John, and Georgiana were now clustered round their mama in the drawing-room: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) lay reclined on a sofa by the fireside, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) darlings about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) -LRB-for the time neither quarrelling nor crying-RRB- looked perfectly happy.
<p/>Me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had dispensed from joining the group; saying, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) heard from Bessie, and could discover by her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.
<p/>CURRER BELL. April 13 th , 1848. CHAPTER I There was no possibility of taking a walk that day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) elders in that manner.
<p/>What does Bessie say I have done? '' I asked. '' Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.
<p/>It contained a bookcase: I soon possessed myself of a volume, taking care that it should be one stored with pictures.
<p/>I mounted into the window- seat: gathering up my feet, I sat cross-legged, like a Turk; and, having drawn the red moreen curtain nearly close, I was shrined in double retirement.
<p/>Folds of scarlet drapery shut in my view to the right hand; to the left were the clear panes of glass, protecting, but not separating me from the drear November day.
<p/>'' A breakfast-room adjoined the drawing-room, I slipped in there. At intervals, while turning over the leaves of my book, I studied the aspect of that winter afternoon.
<p/>Afar, it offered a pale blank of mist and cloud; near a scene of wet lawn and storm-beat shrub, with ceaseless rain sweeping away wildly before a long and lamentable blast.
<p/>I returned to my book--Bewick's History of British Birds: the letterpress thereof I cared little for, generally speaking; and yet there were certain introductory pages that, child as I was, I could not pass quite as a blank.
<p/>They were those which treat of the haunts of sea-fowl; of <div class="bookquote">``the solitary rocks and promontories''  (<font color='red'><b>Thule</b></font>)</div>by them only inhabited; of the coast of Norway, studded with isles from its southern extremity, the Lindeness, or Naze, to the North Cape--
<p/>``Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls, Boils round the naked, melancholy isles Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.
<p/>Nor could I pass unnoticed the suggestion of the bleak shores of Lapland, Siberia, Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Iceland, Greenland, with <div class="bookquote">``the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.
<p/>Of these death-white realms I formed an idea of my own: shadowy, like all the half-comprehended notions that float dim through children's brains, but strangely impressive.
<p/>The words in these introductory pages connected themselves with the succeeding vignettes, and gave significance to the rock standing up alone in a sea of billow and spray; to the broken boat stranded on a desolate coast; to the cold and ghastly moon glancing through bars of cloud at a wreck just sinking.
<p/>I cannot tell what sentiment haunted the quite solitary churchyard, with its inscribed headstone; its gate, its two trees, its low horizon, girdled by a broken wall, and its newly-risen crescent, attesting the hour of eventide.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' The two ships becalmed on a torpid sea, I believed to be marine phantoms. The fiend pinning down the thief's pack behind him (<font color='blue'><b>fiend</b></font>), I passed over quickly: it was an object of terror.
<p/>Each picture told a story; mysterious often to my undeveloped understanding and imperfect feelings, yet ever profoundly interesting: as interesting as the tales Bessie sometimes narrated on winter evenings, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) chanced to be in good humour; and when, having brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) ironing-table to the nursery hearth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) allowed us to sit about it, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) got up Mrs. Reed's lace frills, and crimped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) nightcap borders, fed our eager attention with passages of love and adventure taken from old fairy tales and other ballads; or -LRB-as at a later period I discovered-RRB- from the pages of Pamela, and Henry, Earl of Moreland.
<p/>So was the black horned thing seated aloof on a rock, surveying a distant crowd surrounding a gallows. With Bewick on my knee, I was then happy: happy at least in my way.
<p/>I feared nothing but interruption, and that came too soon. The breakfast- room door opened. '' Boh! Madam Mope! '' cried the voice of John Reed; then he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) paused: he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) found the room apparently empty.
<p/>'' Where the dickens is she (<font color='blue'><b>Pamela</b></font>)!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) continued. '' Lizzy! Georgy! -LRB-calling to his (<font color='blue'><b>Georgy</b></font>) sisters-RRB- Joan is not here: tell mama she (<font color='blue'><b>Joan</b></font>) is run out into the rain--bad animal!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is well I drew the curtain,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I; and I wished fervently he (<font color='blue'><b>Georgy</b></font>) might not discover my hiding-place: nor would John Reed have found it out himself
<p/>; he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was not quick either of vision or conception; but Eliza just put her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) head in at the door, and said at once-- <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza</b></font>)</div>And I came out immediately, for I trembled at the idea of being dragged forth by the said Jack. ''
<p/>What do you want? '' I asked, with awkward diffidence. <div class="bookquote">``Say, `What do you want, Master Reed?' ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer.
<p/>I want you to come here;'' and seating himself in an arm-chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) intimated by a gesture that I was to approach and stand before him (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>).
<p/>John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten: large and stout for his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) gorged himself habitually at table, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) bilious, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) a dim and bleared eye and flabby cheeks.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) ought now to have been at school; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) mama had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) home for a month or two, <div class="bookquote">``on account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) delicate health.
<p/>Mr. Miles, the master, affirmed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) would do very well if he (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) had fewer cakes and sweetmeats sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Miles</b></font>) from home; but the mother's heart turned from an opinion so harsh, and inclined rather to the more refined idea that John's sallowness was owing to over-application and, perhaps, to pining after home.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) bullied and punished me; not two or three times in the week, nor once or twice in the day, but continually: every nerve I had feared him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and every morsel of flesh in my bones shrank when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came near.
<p/>There were moments when I was bewildered by the terror he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) inspired, because I had no appeal whatever against either his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) menaces or his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) inflictions; the servants did not like to offend their young master by taking my part against him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and Mrs. Reed was blind and deaf on the subject
<p/>: she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) strike or heard him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) abuse me, though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did both now and then in her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) very presence, more frequently, however, behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) back.
<p/>Habitually obedient to John, I came up to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chair: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) spent some three minutes in thrusting out his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tongue at me as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could without damaging the roots: I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would soon strike, and while dreading the blow, I mused on the disgusting and ugly appearance of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) who would presently deal it.
<p/>I wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) read that notion in my face; for, all at once, without speaking, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) struck suddenly and strongly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' John had not much affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother and sisters, and an antipathy to me. I tottered, and on regaining my equilibrium retired back a step or two from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chair.
<p/>That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Accustomed to John Reed's abuse, I never had an idea of replying to it; my care was how to endure the blow which would certainly follow the insult.
<p/>'' '' What were you doing behind the curtain? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) asked. '' I was reading. '' <div class="bookquote">``Show the book. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.
<p/>Now, I'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they are mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years.
<p/>I returned to the window and fetched it thence. '' Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.
<p/>I did so, not at first aware what was his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) intention; but when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) lift and poise the book and stand in act to hurl it, I instinctively started aside with a cry of alarm: not soon enough, however; the volume was flung, it hit me, and I fell, striking my head against the door and cutting it.
<p/>'' The cut bled, the pain was sharp: my terror had passed its climax; other feelings succeeded. '' Wicked and cruel boy!
<p/>'' I said. '' You are like a murderer--you are like a slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors! '' I had read Goldsmith's History of Rome, and had formed my opinion of Nero, Caligula, etc..
<p/>Also I had drawn parallels in silence, which I never thought thus to have declared aloud. '' What! what!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>) cried.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>) ran headlong at me: I felt him (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>) grasp my hair and my shoulder: he (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>) had closed with a desperate thing.
<p/>'' Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>) say that to me? Did you hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>), Eliza and Georgiana? Won't I tell mama? but first-- I really saw in him (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>) a tyrant, a murderer.
<p/>I felt a drop or two of blood from my head trickle down my neck, and was sensible of somewhat pungent suffering: these sensations for the time predominated over fear, and I received him (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>) in frantic sort.
<p/>I don't very well know what I did with my hands, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>) called me <div class="bookquote">``Rat! Rat!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and bellowed out aloud.
<p/>Eliza and Georgiana had run for Mrs. Reed, who was gone upstairs: she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) now came upon the scene, followed by Bessie and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) maid Abbot.
<p/>Aid was near him (<font color='blue'><b>Caligula</b></font>): We were parted: I heard the words-- <div class="bookquote">``Dear! dear! What a fury to fly at Master John!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>Then Mrs. Reed subjoined-- <div class="bookquote">``Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) away to the red-room, and lock her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) in there.
<p/>I resisted all the way: a new thing for me, and a circumstance which greatly strengthened the bad opinion Bessie and Miss Abbot were disposed to entertain of me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>Four hands were immediately laid upon me, and I was borne upstairs. CHAPTER II The fact is, I was a trifle beside myself; or rather out of myself, as the French would say:
<p/>I was conscious that a moment's mutiny had already rendered me liable to strange penalties, and, like any other rebel slave, I felt resolved, in my desperation, to go all lengths.
<p/>'' Hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) arms, Miss Abbot: she (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>)'s like a mad cat.'' <div class="bookquote">``For shame! for shame!''  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>cried the lady's-maid. '' What shocking conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!
<p/>Your young master. '' <div class="bookquote">``Master! How is he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) my master? Am I a servant?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep.
<p/>They had got me by this time into the apartment indicated by Mrs. Reed, and had thrust me upon a stool: my impulse was to rise from it like a spring; their two pair of hands arrested me instantly.
<p/>There, sit down, and think over your wickedness. '' '' If you don't sit still, you must be tied down,'' said Bessie.
<p/>'' Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) would break mine directly. '' Miss Abbot turned to divest a stout leg of the necessary ligature.
<p/>This preparation for bonds, and the additional ignominy it inferred, took a little of the excitement out of me. '' Don't take them off,'' I cried; <div class="bookquote">``I will not stir.
<p/>Mind you don't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Bessie; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had ascertained that I was really subsiding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) loosened her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) hold of me; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) and Miss Abbot stood with folded arms, looking darkly and doubtfully on my face, as incredulous of my sanity.
<p/>'' In guarantee whereof, I attached myself to my seat by my hands. '' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) never did so before,'' at last said Bessie, turning to the Abigail.
<p/>'' But it was always in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>),'' was the reply. '' I've told Missis often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.
<p/>Bessie answered not; but ere long, addressing me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) keeps you: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.
<p/>I had nothing to say to these words: they were not new to me: my very first recollections of existence included hints of the same kind.
<p/>This reproach of my dependence had become a vague sing-song in my ear: very painful and crushing, but only half intelligible.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>)'s an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) age with so much cover. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Miss Abbot joined in--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them.
<p/>They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Abbot/Miss Abbot</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``What we tell you is for your good,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div>added Bessie, in no harsh voice, <div class="bookquote">``you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am sure.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div>'' Besides,'' said Miss Abbot, <div class="bookquote">``God will punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>): He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) might strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) dead in the midst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) tantrums, and then where would she (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) go?
<p/>Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away.
<p/>Come, Bessie, we will leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>): I wouldn't have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) heart for anything. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Abbot/Miss Abbot</b></font>)</div>They went, shutting the door, and locking it behind them.
<p/>The red-room was a square chamber, very seldom slept in, I might say never, indeed, unless when a chance influx of visitors at Gateshead Hall rendered it necessary to turn to account all the accommodation it contained: yet it was one of the largest and stateliest chambers in the mansion.
<p/>A bed supported on massive pillars of mahogany, hung with curtains of deep red damask, stood out like a tabernacle in the centre; the two large windows, with their blinds always drawn down, were half shrouded in festoons and falls of similar drapery; the carpet was red; the table at the foot of the bed was covered with a crimson cloth; the walls were a soft fawn colour with a blush of pink in it; the wardrobe, the toilet-table, the chairs were of darkly polished old mahogany.
<p/>Out of these deep surrounding shades rose high, and glared white, the piled- up mattresses and pillows of the bed, spread with a snowy Marseilles counterpane.
<p/>Scarcely less prominent was an ample cushioned easy-chair near the head of the bed, also white, with a footstool before it; and looking, as I thought, like a pale throne.
<p/>This room was chill, because it seldom had a fire; it was silent, because remote from the nursery and kitchen; solemn, because it was known to be so seldom entered.
<p/>The house-maid alone came here on Saturdays, to wipe from the mirrors and the furniture a week's quiet dust: and Mrs. Reed herself, at far intervals, visited it to review the contents of a certain secret drawer in the wardrobe, where were stored divers parchments, her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) jewel-casket, and a miniature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) deceased husband; and in those last words lies the secret of the red-room--the spell which kept it so lonely in spite of its grandeur.
<p/>Mr. Reed had been dead nine years: it was in this chamber he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) breathed his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) last; here he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) lay in state; hence his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) coffin was borne by the undertaker's men; and, since that day, a sense of dreary consecration had guarded it from frequent intrusion.
<p/>My seat, to which Bessie and the bitter Miss Abbot had left me riveted, was a low ottoman near the marble chimney-piece; the bed rose before me; to my right hand there was the high, dark wardrobe, with subdued, broken reflections varying the gloss of its panels; to my left were the muffled windows; a great looking-glass between them repeated the vacant majesty of the bed and room.
<p/>I was not quite sure whether they had locked the door; and when I dared move, I got up and went to see.
<p/>Alas! yes: no jail was ever more secure. Returning, I had to cross before the looking- glass; my fascinated glance involuntarily explored the depth it revealed.
<p/>All looked colder and darker in that visionary hollow than in reality: and the strange little figure there gazing at me, with a white face and arms specking the gloom, and glittering eyes of fear moving where all else was still, had the effect of a real spirit: I thought it like one of the tiny phantoms, half fairy,
<p/>half imp, Bessie's evening stories represented as coming out of lone, ferny dells in moors, and appearing before the eyes of belated travellers.
<p/>Superstition was with me at that moment; but it was not yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) hour for complete victory: my blood was still warm; the mood of the revolted slave was still bracing me with its bitter vigour; I had to stem a rapid rush of retrospective thought before I quailed to the dismal present.
<p/>All John Reed's violent tyrannies, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) sisters' proud indifference, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) mother's aversion, all the servants' partiality, turned up in my disturbed mind like a dark deposit in a turbid well.
<p/>I returned to my stool. Why was I always suffering, always browbeaten, always accused, for ever condemned? Why could I never please?
<p/>Why was it useless to try to win any one's favour? Eliza, who was headstrong and selfish, was respected. Georgiana, who had a spoiled temper, a very acrid spite, a captious and insolent carriage, was universally indulged.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) beauty, her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) pink cheeks and golden curls, seemed to give delight to all who looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), and to purchase indemnity for every fault.
<p/>John no one thwarted, much less punished; though he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) twisted the necks of the pigeons, killed the little pea-chicks, set the dogs at the sheep, stripped the hothouse vines of their fruit, and broke the buds off the choicest plants in the conservatory: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother <div class="bookquote">``old girl,''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>too; sometimes reviled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dark skin, similar to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own; bluntly disregarded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wishes; not unfrequently tore and spoiled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) silk attire; and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was still <div class="bookquote">``her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own darling.
<p/>I dared commit no fault: I strove to fulfil every duty; and I was termed naughty and tiresome, sullen and sneaking, from morning to noon, and from noon to night.
<p/>My head still ached and bled with the blow and fall I had received: no one had reproved John for wantonly striking me; and because I had turned against him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to avert farther irrational violence, I was loaded with general opprobrium.
<p/>Unjust!--unjust!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said my reason, forced by the agonising stimulus into precocious though transitory power: and Resolve, equally wrought up, instigated some strange expedient to achieve escape from insupportable oppression--as running away, or, if that could not be effected, never eating or drinking more, and letting myself die.
<p/>'' '' What a consternation of soul was mine that dreary afternoon! How all my brain was in tumult, and all my heart in insurrection!
<p/>I could not answer the ceaseless inward question-- why I thus suffered; now, at the distance of--I will not say how many years, I see it clearly.
<p/>Yet in what darkness, what dense ignorance, was the mental battle fought! I was a discord in Gateshead Hall: I was like nobody there; I had nothing in harmony with Mrs. Reed or her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) children, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) chosen vassalage.
<p/>They were not bound to regard with affection a thing that could not sympathise with one amongst them; a heterogeneous thing, opposed to them in temperament, in capacity, in propensities; a useless thing, incapable of serving their interest, or adding to their pleasure; a noxious thing, cherishing the germs of indignation at their treatment, of contempt of their judgment.
<p/>If they did not love me, in fact, as little did I love them. I know that had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child--though equally dependent and friendless--
<p/>Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery.
<p/>Mrs. Daylight began to forsake the red-room; it was past four o'clock, and the beclouded afternoon was tending to drear twilight.
<p/>I heard the rain still beating continuously on the staircase window, and the wind howling in the grove behind the hall; I grew by degrees cold as a stone, and then my courage sank.
<p/>My habitual mood of humiliation, self-doubt, forlorn depression, fell damp on the embers of my decaying ire. All said I was wicked, and perhaps I might be so;
<p/>what thought had I been but just conceiving of starving myself to death? That certainly was a crime: and was I fit to die?
<p/>In such vault I had been told did Mr. Reed lie buried; and led by this thought to recall his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) idea, I dwelt on it with gathering dread.
<p/>I could not remember him (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>); but I knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was my own uncle--my mother's brother--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) had taken me when a parentless infant to his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) house; and that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) last moments he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) had required a promise of Mrs. Reed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) would rear and maintain me as one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) own children.
<p/>Or was the vault under the chancel of Gateshead Church an inviting bourne? Mrs. Reed probably considered she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) had kept this promise; and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) had,
<p/>I dare say, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) nature would permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>); but how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) really like an interloper not of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) race, and unconnected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>), after her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) husband's death, by any tie?
<p/>It must have been most irksome to find herself bound by a hard-wrung pledge to stand in the stead of a parent to a strange child she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) could not love, and to see an uncongenial alien permanently intruded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) own family group.
<p/>I doubted not--never doubted--that if Mr. Reed had been alive he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) would have treated me kindly; and now, as I sat looking at the white bed and overshadowed walls--occasionally also turning a fascinated eye towards the dimly gleaning mirror--I began to recall what I had heard of dead men, troubled in their graves by the violation of their last wishes, revisiting the earth to punish the perjured and avenge the oppressed; and I thought Mr. Reed's spirit, harassed by the wrongs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) sister's child, might quit its abode--whether in the church vault or in the unknown world of the departed--and rise before me in this chamber.
<p/>I wiped my tears and hushed my sobs, fearful lest any sign of violent grief might waken a preternatural voice to comfort me, or elicit from the gloom some haloed face, bending over me with strange pity.
<p/>This idea, consolatory in theory, I felt would be terrible if realised: with all my might I endeavoured to stifle it--
<p/>Shaking my hair from my eyes, I lifted my head and tried to look boldly round the dark room; at this moment a light gleamed on the wall.
<p/>A singular notion dawned upon me. I endeavoured to be firm. Was it, I asked myself, a ray from the moon penetrating some aperture in the blind?
<p/>No; moonlight was still, and this stirred; while I gazed, it glided up to the ceiling and quivered over my head.
<p/>I can now conjecture readily that this streak of light was, in all likelihood, a gleam from a lantern carried by some one across the lawn: but then, prepared as my mind was for horror, shaken as my nerves were by agitation, I thought the swift darting beam was a herald of some coming vision from another world.
<p/>My heart beat thick, my head grew hot; a sound filled my ears, which I deemed the rushing of wings; something seemed near me; I was oppressed, suffocated: endurance broke down; I rushed to the door and shook the lock in desperate effort.
<p/>Steps came running along the outer passage; the key turned, Bessie and Abbot entered. '' Miss Eyre, are you ill?'' said Bessie.
<p/>'' What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me! '' exclaimed Abbot. <div class="bookquote">``Take me out! Let me go into the nursery!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my cry.
<p/>'' What for? Are you hurt? Have you seen something?'' again demanded Bessie. '' Oh! I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.
<p/>'' I had now got hold of Bessie's hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) did not snatch it from me. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) has screamed out on purpose,'' declared Abbot, in some disgust.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) had been in great pain one would have excused it, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) only wanted to bring us all here
<p/>What is all this?'' demanded another voice peremptorily; and Mrs. Reed came along the corridor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) cap flying wide, her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) gown rustling stormily.
<p/>Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in the red-room till I came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) myself.''
<p/>'' And what a scream! : I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) naughty tricks. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div>pleaded Bessie.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) go,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the only answer. '' Loose Bessie's hand, child: you cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.
<p/>I abhor artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you then.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``O aunt! have pity! Forgive me! I cannot endure it--let me be punished some other way! I shall be killed if--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Silence!
<p/>I was a precocious actress in her (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) eyes; she (<font color='blue'><b>actress</b></font>) sincerely looked on me as a compound of virulent passions, mean spirit, and dangerous duplicity.
<p/>Bessie and Abbot having retreated, Mrs. Reed, impatient of my now frantic anguish and wild sobs, abruptly thrust me back and locked me in, without farther parley.
<p/>I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) sweeping away; and soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was gone, I suppose I had a species of fit: unconsciousness closed the scene.
<p/>The next thing I remember is, waking up with a feeling as if I had had a frightful nightmare, and seeing before me a terrible red glare, crossed with thick black bars.
<p/>I heard voices, too, speaking with a hollow sound, and as if muffled by a rush of wind or water: agitation, uncertainty, and an all-predominating sense of terror confused my faculties.
<p/>Ere long, I became aware that some one was handling me; lifting me up and supporting me in a sitting posture, and that more tenderly than I had ever been raised or upheld before.
<p/>This violence is all most repulsive:''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and so, no doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) felt it. CHAPTER III I rested my head against a pillow or an arm, and felt easy.
<p/>In five minutes more the cloud of bewilderment dissolved: I knew quite well that I was in my own bed, and that the red glare was the nursery fire.
<p/>It was night: a candle burnt on the table; Bessie stood at the bed- foot with a basin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) hand, and a gentleman sat in a chair near my pillow, leaning over me.
<p/>I felt an inexpressible relief, a soothing conviction of protection and security, when I knew that there was a stranger in the room, an individual not belonging to Gateshead, and not related to Mrs. Reed.
<p/>Turning from Bessie -LRB-though her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) presence was far less obnoxious to me than that of Abbot, for instance, would have been-RRB-, I scrutinised the face of the gentleman:
<p/>I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>); it was Mr. Lloyd, an apothecary, sometimes called in by Mrs. Reed when the servants were ailing: for herself and the children she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) employed a physician.
<p/>I pronounced his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) name, offering him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) at the same time my hand: he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) took it, smiling and saying, <div class="bookquote">``We shall do very well by-and-by.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) laid me down, and addressing Bessie, charged her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) to be very careful that I was not disturbed during the night.
<p/>Having given some further directions, and intimates that he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) should call again the next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) departed; to my grief: I felt so sheltered and befriended while he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) sat in the chair near my pillow; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) closed the door after him (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>), all the room darkened and my heart again sank: inexpressible sadness weighed it down.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well, who am I? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) asked. '' '' Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss? '' asked Bessie, rather softly.
<p/>Scarcely dared I answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>); for I feared the next sentence might be rough. '' I will try. '' <div class="bookquote">``Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you may call me if you want anything in the night.
<p/>'' No, thank you, Bessie.'' '' '' Wonderful civility this! It emboldened me to ask a question. '' Bessie, what is the matter with me?
<p/>Am I ill?'' '' You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better soon, no doubt. ''
<p/>Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be alone with that poor child to-night
<p/>Bessie went into the housemaid's apartment, which was near. I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) say-- '' : she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) might die; it's such a strange thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) should have that fit: I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) saw anything.
<p/>Missis was rather too hard. '' Sarah came back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>); they both went to bed; they were whispering together for half-an-hour before they fell asleep.
<p/>I caught scraps of their conversation, from which I was able only too distinctly to infer the main subject discussed. ''
<p/>Something passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>), all dressed in white, and vanished''--<div class="bookquote">``A great black dog behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Three loud raps on the chamber door'' (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``A light in the churchyard just over his (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) grave,''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>etc., etc..
<p/>For me, the watches of that long night passed in ghastly wakefulness; strained by dread: such dread as children only can feel.
<p/>No severe or prolonged bodily illness followed this incident of the red- room; it only gave my nerves a shock of which I feel the reverberation to this day.
<p/>I owe some fearful pangs of mental suffering, but I ought to forgive you, for you knew not what you did: while rending my heart-strings, you thought you were only uprooting my bad propensities.
<p/>At last both slept: the fire and the candle went out. Yes, Mrs. Reed, to you Next day, by noon, I was up and dressed, and sat wrapped in a shawl by the nursery hearth.
<p/>I felt physically weak and broken down: but my worse ailment was an unutterable wretchedness of mind: a wretchedness which kept drawing from me silent tears; no sooner had I wiped one salt drop from my cheek than another followed.
<p/>Yet, I thought, I ought to have been happy, for none of the Reeds were there, they were all gone out in the carriage with their mama.
<p/>Abbot, too, was sewing in another room, and Bessie, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) moved hither and thither, putting away toys and arranging drawers, addressed to me every now and then a word of unwonted kindness.
<p/>This state of things should have been to me a paradise of peace, accustomed as I was to a life of ceaseless reprimand and thankless fagging; but, in fact, my racked nerves were now in such a state that no calm could soothe, and no pleasure excite them agreeably.
<p/>Bessie had been down into the kitchen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) brought up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) a tart on a certain brightly painted china plate, whose bird of paradise, nestling in a wreath of convolvuli and rosebuds, had been wont to stir in me a most enthusiastic sense of admiration; and which plate I had often petitioned to be allowed to take in my hand in order to examine it more closely, but had always hitherto been deemed unworthy of such a privilege.
<p/>This precious vessel was now placed on my knee, and I was cordially invited to eat the circlet of delicate pastry upon it.
<p/>I could not eat the tart; and the plumage of the bird, the tints of the flowers, seemed strangely faded: I put both plate and tart away.
<p/>Bessie asked if I would have a book: the word book acted as a transient stimulus, and I begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) to fetch Gulliver's Travels from the library.
<p/>Vain favour! coming, like most other favours long deferred and often wished for, too late! This book I had again and again perused with delight.
<p/>I considered it a narrative of facts, and discovered in it a vein of interest deeper than what I found in fairy tales: for as to the elves, having sought them in vain among foxglove leaves and bells, under mushrooms and beneath the ground-ivy mantling old wall-nooks, I had at length made up my mind to the sad truth, that they were all gone out of England to some savage country where the woods were wilder and thicker, and the population more scant; whereas, Lilliput and Brobdignag being, in my creed, solid parts of the earth's surface, I doubted not that I might one day, by taking a long voyage, see with my own eyes the little fields, houses, and trees, the diminutive people, the tiny cows, sheep, and birds of the one realm; and the corn-fields forest-high, the mighty mastiffs, the monster cats, the tower-like men and women, of the other.
<p/>Yet, when this cherished volume was now placed in my hand--when I turned over its leaves, and sought in its marvellous pictures the charm I had, till now, never failed to find--
<p/>all was eerie and dreary; the giants were gaunt goblins, the pigmies malevolent and fearful imps, Gulliver a most desolate wanderer in most dread and dangerous regions.
<p/>Bessie had now finished dusting and tidying the room, and having washed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) opened a certain little drawer, full of splendid shreds of silk and satin, and began making a new bonnet for Georgiana's doll.
<p/>I closed the book, which I dared no longer peruse, and put it on the table, beside the untasted tart. Meantime she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sang: her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) song was--
<p/>I had often heard the song before, and always with lively delight; for Bessie had a sweet voice,--at least, I thought so.
<p/>'' In the days when we went gipsying, A long time ago. '' But now, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) voice was still sweet, I found in its melody an indescribable sadness.
<p/>Sometimes, preoccupied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) sang the refrain very low, very lingeringly; <div class="bookquote">``A long time ago''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>came out like the saddest cadence of a funeral hymn.
<p/>My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary; Long is the way, and the mountains are wild; Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary Over the path of the poor orphan child.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) passed into another ballad, this time a really doleful one. '' Why did they send me so far and so lonely, Up where the moors spread and grey rocks are piled?
<p/>Yet distant and soft the night breeze is blowing, Clouds there are none, and clear stars beam mild, God, in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mercy, protection is showing, Comfort and hope to the poor orphan child.
<p/>Ev'n should I fall o'er the broken bridge passing, Or stray in the marshes, by false lights beguiled, Still will my Father, with promise and blessing, Take to His (<font color='blue'><b>Father</b></font>) bosom the poor orphan child.
<p/>Men are hard-hearted, and kind angels only Watch o'er the steps of a poor orphan child. There is a thought that for strength should avail me,
<p/>Though both of shelter and kindred despoiled; Heaven is a home, and a rest will not fail me; God is a friend to the poor orphan child.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Miss Jane, don't cry,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div>said Bessie as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) finished. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) might as well have said to the fire, <div class="bookquote">``don't burn!''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>but how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) divine the morbid suffering to which I was a prey? In the course of the morning Mr. Lloyd came again.
<p/>'' What, already up!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) entered the nursery. '' Well, nurse, how is she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)?'' Bessie answered that I was doing very well.
<p/>'' Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) ought to look more cheerful. Come here, Miss Jane: your name is Jane, is it not?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>'' Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about? Have you any pain?'' ''
<p/>No, sir.'' '' Oh! I daresay she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) is crying because she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) could not go out with Missis in the carriage,'' interposed Bessie.
<p/>I thought so too; and my self-esteem being wounded by the false charge, I answered promptly, <div class="bookquote">``I never cried for such a thing in my life:
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Surely not! why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) is too old for such pettishness. '' I hate going out in the carriage. I cry because I am miserable.''
<p/>'' Oh fie, Miss!'' said Bessie. The good apothecary appeared a little puzzled. I was standing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) eyes on me very steadily:
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) eyes were small and grey; not very bright, but I dare say I should think them shrewd now : he (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had a hard-featured yet good-natured looking face.
<p/>Having considered me at leisure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) said-- <div class="bookquote">``What made you ill yesterday?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had a fall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div>said Bessie, again putting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) word.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fall! why, that is like a baby again! Can't she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) manage to walk at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) age? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) must be eight or nine years old.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I was knocked down,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>was the blunt explanation, jerked out of me by another pang of mortified pride; <div class="bookquote">``but that did not make me ill,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I added; while Mr. Lloyd helped himself to a pinch of snuff.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) was returning the box to his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) waistcoat pocket, a loud bell rang for the servants' dinner; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) knew what it was.
<p/>'' That's for you, nurse,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back.
<p/>Bessie would rather have stayed, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was obliged to go, because punctuality at meals was rigidly enforced at Gateshead Hall.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?'' pursued Mr. Lloyd when Bessie was gone. '' I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.
<p/>'' I saw Mr. Lloyd smile and frown at the same time. '' Ghost! What, you are a baby after all!
<p/>You are afraid of ghosts?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) died in that room, and was laid out there.
<p/>Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! And is it that makes you so miserable? Are you afraid now in daylight?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What other things? Can you tell me some of them? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>How much I wished to reply fully to this question!
<p/>Children can feel, but they cannot analyse their feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in words.
<p/>Fearful, however, of losing this first and only opportunity of relieving my grief by imparting it, I, after a disturbed pause, contrived to frame a meagre, though, as far as it went, true response.
<p/>How difficult it was to frame any answer! '' For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You have a kind aunt and cousins. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Again I paused; then bunglingly enounced-- <div class="bookquote">``But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mr. Lloyd a second time produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) snuff-box. '' Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?'' asked he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>).
<p/>'' Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here than a servant.
<p/>If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps you may--who knows?
<p/>Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think not, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>'' None belonging to your father?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't know.
<p/>I asked Aunt Reed once, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) said possibly I might have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) knew nothing about them.''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>Poverty looks grim to grown people; still more so to children: they have not much idea of industrious, working, respectable poverty; they think of the word only as connected with ragged clothes, scanty food, fireless grates, rude manners, and debasing vices: poverty for me was synonymous with degradation.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If you had such, would you like to go to them? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I reflected. '' No; I should not like to belong to poor people,'' was my reply.
<p/>I shook my head: I could not see how poor people had the means of being kind; and then to learn to speak like them, to adopt their manners, to be uneducated, to grow up like one of the poor women I saw sometimes nursing their children or washing their clothes at the cottage doors of the village of Gateshead: no, I was not heroic enough to purchase liberty at the price of caste.
<p/>'' Not even if they were kind to you? '' '' But are your relatives so very poor? Are they working people?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly set: I should not like to go a begging.
<p/>Again I reflected: I scarcely knew what school was: Bessie sometimes spoke of it as a place where young ladies sat in the stocks, wore backboards, and were expected to be exceedingly genteel and precise: John Reed hated his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) school, and abused his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) master; but John Reed's tastes were no rule for mine, and if Bessie's accounts of school-discipline -LRB-gathered from the young ladies of a family where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had lived before coming to Gateshead-RRB- were somewhat appalling, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) details of certain accomplishments attained by these same young ladies were, I thought, equally attractive.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) boasted of beautiful paintings of landscapes and flowers by them executed; of songs they could sing and pieces they could play, of purses they could net, of French books they could translate; till my spirit was moved to emulation as I listened.
<p/>Besides, school would be a complete change: it implied a long journey, an entire separation from Gateshead, an entrance into a new life.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Would you like to go to school? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I should indeed like to go to school,'' was the audible conclusion of my musings.
<p/>The child ought to have change of air and scene,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) added, speaking to himself; <div class="bookquote">``nerves not in a good state.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well, well! who knows what may happen?'' said Mr. Lloyd, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) got up. '' '' Bessie now returned; at the same moment the carriage was heard rolling up the gravel-walk.
<p/>'' Is that your mistress, nurse?'' asked Mr. Lloyd. '' I should like to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) before I go. ''
<p/>In the interview which followed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) and Mrs. Reed, I presume, from after-occurrences, that the apothecary ventured to recommend my being sent to school; and the recommendation was no doubt readily enough adopted; for as Abbot said, in discussing the subject with Bessie when both sat sewing in the nursery one night, after I was in bed, and, as they thought, asleep, <div class="bookquote">``Missis was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) dared say, glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand.
<p/>Bessie invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) to walk into the breakfast-room, and led the way out. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Abbot, I think, gave me credit for being a sort of infantine Guy Fawkes.
<p/>On that same occasion I learned, for the first time, from Miss Abbot's communications to Bessie, that my father had been a poor clergyman; that my mother had married him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) against the wishes of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends, who considered the match beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>); that my grandfather Reed was so irritated at her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) disobedience, he (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>) cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) off without a shilling; that after my mother and father had been married a year, the latter caught the typhus fever while visiting among the poor of a large manufacturing town where his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) curacy was situated, and where that disease was then prevalent: that my mother took the infection from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and both died within a month of each other.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Abbot/Miss Abbot</b></font>)</div>responded Abbot; <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) were a nice, pretty child, one might compassionate her (<font color='blue'><b>Abbot</b></font>) forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Abbot/Miss Abbot</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not a great deal, to be sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div>agreed Bessie: <div class="bookquote">``at any rate, a beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div><p/>Bessie, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) heard this narrative, sighed and said, <div class="bookquote">``Poor Miss Jane is to be pitied, too, Abbot.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!
<p/>Little darling!--with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) long curls and her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) has; just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Abbot</b></font>)</div><p/>'' cried the fervent Abbot. '' '' So could I--with a roast onion. Come, we'll go down. '' They went. CHAPTER IV
<p/>From my discourse with Mr. Lloyd, and from the above reported conference between Bessie and Abbot, I gathered enough of hope to suffice as a motive for wishing to get well: a change seemed near,--I desired and waited it in silence.
<p/>days and weeks passed: I had regained my normal state of health, but no new allusion was made to the subject over which I brooded.
<p/>Mrs. Reed surveyed me at times with a severe eye, but seldom addressed me: since my illness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) had drawn a more marked line of separation than ever between me and her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) own children; appointing me a small closet to sleep in by myself, condemning me to take my meals alone, and pass all my time in the nursery, while my cousins were constantly in the drawing-room.
<p/>Not a hint, however, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) drop about sending me to school: still I felt an instinctive certainty that she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) would not long endure me under the same roof with her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>); for her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) glance, now more than ever, when turned on me, expressed an insuperable and rooted aversion.
<p/>Eliza and Georgiana, evidently acting according to orders, spoke to me as little as possible: John thrust his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tongue in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cheek whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) saw me, and once attempted chastisement; but as I instantly turned against him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), roused by the same sentiment of deep ire and desperate revolt which had stirred my corruption before, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thought it better to desist, and ran from me tittering execrations, and vowing I had burst his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nose.
<p/>I had indeed levelled at that prominent feature as hard a blow as my knuckles could inflict; and when I saw that either that or my look daunted him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), I had the greatest inclination to follow up my advantage to purpose; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was already with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mama.
<p/>I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in a blubbering tone commence the tale of how <div class="bookquote">``that nasty Jane Eyre''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>had flown at him (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) like a mad cat: he (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) was stopped rather harshly--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk to me about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), John: I told you not to go near her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).
<p/>It tarried, however: ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Here, leaning over the banister, I cried out suddenly, and without at all deliberating on my words--
<p/>Mrs. Reed was rather a stout woman; but, on hearing this strange and audacious declaration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) ran nimbly up the stair, swept me like a whirlwind into the nursery, and crushing me down on the edge of my crib, dared me in an emphatic voice to rise from that place, or utter one syllable during the remainder of the day.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``They are not fit to associate with me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>'' What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) were alive?
<p/>I say scarcely voluntary, for it seemed as if my tongue pronounced words without my will consenting to their utterance: something spoke out of me over which I had no control.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Reed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) breath: her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) usually cold composed grey eye became troubled with a look like fear; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) hand from my arm, and gazed at me as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) really did not know whether I were child or fiend.
<p/>'' was my scarcely voluntary demand. I was now in for it. '' My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can papa and mama
<p/>Mrs. Reed soon rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) spirits: she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) shook me most soundly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) boxed both my ears, and then left me without a word.
<p/>Bessie supplied the hiatus by a homily of an hour's length, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) proved beyond a doubt that I was the most wicked and abandoned child ever reared under a roof.
<p/>: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you wish me dead. '' I half believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>); for I felt indeed only bad feelings surging in my breast.
<p/>Christmas and the New Year had been celebrated at Gateshead with the usual festive cheer; presents had been interchanged, dinners and evening parties given.
<p/>From every enjoyment I was, of course, excluded: my share of the gaiety consisted in witnessing the daily apparelling of Eliza and Georgiana, and seeing them descend to the drawing-room, dressed out in thin muslin frocks and scarlet sashes, with hair elaborately ringletted; and afterwards, in listening to the sound of the piano or the harp played below, to the passing to and fro of the butler and footman, to the jingling of glass and china as refreshments were handed, to the broken hum of conversation as the drawing-room door opened and closed.
<p/>When tired of this occupation, I would retire from the stairhead to the solitary and silent nursery: there, though somewhat sad, I was not miserable.
<p/>To speak truth, I had not the least wish to go into company, for in company I was very rarely noticed; and if Bessie had but been kind and companionable, I should have deemed it a treat to spend the evenings quietly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>), instead of passing them under the formidable eye of Mrs. Reed, in a room full of ladies and gentlemen.
<p/>But Bessie, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had dressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) young ladies, used to take herself off to the lively regions of the kitchen and housekeeper's room, generally bearing the candle along with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>).
<p/>I then sat with my doll on my knee till the fire got low, glancing round occasionally to make sure that nothing worse than myself haunted the shadowy room; and when the embers sank to a dull red, I undressed hastily, tugging at knots and strings as I best might, and sought shelter from cold and darkness in my crib.
<p/>To this crib I always took my doll; human beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a faded graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow.
<p/>It puzzles me now to remember with what absurd sincerity I doated on this little toy, half fancying it alive and capable of sensation.
<p/>I could not sleep unless it was folded in my night-gown; and when it lay there safe and warm, I was comparatively happy, believing it to be happy likewise.
<p/>Long did the hours seem while I waited the departure of the company, and listened for the sound of Bessie's step on the stairs: sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) would come up in the interval to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) thimble or her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) scissors, or perhaps to bring me something by way of supper--a bun or a cheese-cake--then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) would sit on the bed while I ate it, and when I had finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) would tuck the clothes round me, and twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) kissed me, and said, <div class="bookquote">``Good night, Miss Jane.
<p/>When thus gentle, Bessie seemed to me the best, prettiest, kindest being in the world; and I wished most intensely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) would always be so pleasant and amiable, and never push me about, or scold, or task me unreasonably, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was too often wont to do.
<p/>Bessie Lee must, I think, have been a girl of good natural capacity, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was smart in all she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) did, and had a remarkable knack of narrative; so, at least, I judge from the impression made on me by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) nursery tales.
<p/>November, December, and half of January passed away. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was pretty too, if my recollections of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) face and person are correct.
<p/>I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) as a slim young woman, with black hair, dark eyes, very nice features, and good, clear complexion; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had a capricious and hasty temper, and indifferent ideas of principle or justice: still, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was, I preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) to any one else at Gateshead Hall.
<p/>It was the fifteenth of January, about nine o'clock in the morning: Bessie was gone down to breakfast; my cousins had not yet been summoned to their mama; Eliza was putting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) bonnet and warm garden-coat to go and feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) poultry, an occupation of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was fond: and not less so of selling the eggs to the housekeeper and hoarding up the money she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) thus obtained.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) had a turn for traffic, and a marked propensity for saving; shown not only in the vending of eggs and chickens, but also in driving hard bargains with the gardener about flower-roots, seeds, and slips of plants; that functionary having orders from Mrs. Reed to buy of his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) young lady all the products of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) parterre she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) wished to sell: and Eliza would have sold the hair off her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) head if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) could have made a handsome profit thereby.
<p/>As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) money, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) first secreted it in odd corners, wrapped in a rag or an old curl-paper; but some of these hoards having been discovered by the housemaid, Eliza, fearful of one day losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) valued treasure, consented to intrust it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mother, at a usurious rate of interest--fifty or sixty per cent.; which interest she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) exacted every quarter, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) accounts in a little book with anxious accuracy.
<p/>Georgiana sat on a high stool, dressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) hair at the glass, and interweaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) curls with artificial flowers and faded feathers, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had found a store in a drawer in the attic.
<p/>I was making my bed, having received strict orders from Bessie to get it arranged before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) returned -LRB-for Bessie now frequently employed me as a sort of under- nurserymaid, to tidy the room, dust the chairs, &c.-RRB-.
<p/>Having spread the quilt and folded my night-dress, I went to the window-seat to put in order some picture-books and doll's house furniture scattered there; an abrupt command from Georgiana to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) playthings alone -LRB-for the tiny chairs and mirrors, the fairy plates and cups, were her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) property-RRB-
<p/>stopped my proceedings; and then, for lack of other occupation, I fell to breathing on the frost-flowers with which the window was fretted, and thus clearing a space in the glass through which I might look out on the grounds, where all was still and petrified under the influence of a hard frost.
<p/>From this window were visible the porter's lodge and the carriage-road, and just as I had dissolved so much of the silver-white foliage veiling the panes as left room to look out, I saw the gates thrown open and a carriage roll through.
<p/>I watched it ascending the drive with indifference; carriages often came to Gateshead, but none ever brought visitors in whom I was interested; it stopped in front of the house, the door-bell rang loudly, the new-comer was admitted.
<p/>All this being nothing to me, my vacant attention soon found livelier attraction in the spectacle of a little hungry robin, which came and chirruped on the twigs of the leafless cherry-tree nailed against the wall near the casement.
<p/>The remains of my breakfast of bread and milk stood on the table, and having crumbled a morsel of roll, I was tugging at the sash to put out the crumbs on the window-sill, when Bessie came running upstairs into the nursery.
<p/>'' Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there? Have you washed your hands and face this morning?
<p/>: the sash yielded; I scattered the crumbs, some on the stone sill, some on the cherry-tree bough, then, closing the window, I replied--
<p/>'' I gave another tug before I answered, for I wanted the bird to be secure of its bread <div class="bookquote">``No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now? You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?
<p/>I was spared the trouble of answering, for Bessie seemed in too great a hurry to listen to explanations; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) hauled me to the washstand, inflicted a merciless, but happily brief scrub on my face and hands with soap, water, and a coarse towel; disciplined my head with a bristly brush, denuded me of my pinafore, and then hurrying me to the top of the stairs, bid me go down directly, as I was wanted in the breakfast-room.
<p/>I would have asked who wanted me: I would have demanded if Mrs. Reed was there; but Bessie was already gone, and had closed the nursery-door upon me.
<p/>For nearly three months, I had never been called to Mrs. Reed's presence; restricted so long to the nursery, the breakfast, dining, and drawing-rooms were become for me awful regions, on which it dismayed me to intrude.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I slowly descended. I now stood in the empty hall; before me was the breakfast-room door, and I stopped, intimidated and trembling.
<p/>I feared to return to the nursery, and feared to go forward to the parlour; ten minutes I stood in agitated hesitation
<p/>What a miserable little poltroon had fear, engendered of unjust punishment, made of me in those days! ; the vehement ringing of the breakfast-room bell decided me; I must enter.
<p/>I asked inwardly, as with both hands I turned the stiff door-handle, which, for a second or two, resisted my efforts.
<p/>'' Who could want me? '' '' What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?
<p/>a black pillar!--such, at least, appeared to me, at first sight, the straight, narrow, sable-clad shape standing erect on the rug: the grim face at the top was like a carved mask, placed above the shaft by way of capital.
<p/>Mrs. Reed occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) usual seat by the fireside; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) made a signal to me to approach; I did so, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) introduced me to the stony stranger with the words: ``This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) , for it was a man, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) head slowly towards where I stood, and having examined me with the two inquisitive-looking grey eyes which twinkled under a pair of bushy brows, said solemnly, and in a bass voice, <div class="bookquote">``Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) size is small: what is her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) age?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The handle turned, the door unclosed, and passing through and curtseying low, I looked up at-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Ten years. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' So much? '' was the doubtful answer; and he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) prolonged his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) scrutiny for some minutes. Presently he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) addressed me--<div class="bookquote">``Your name, little girl?''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>In uttering these words I looked up: he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) seemed to me a tall gentleman; but then I was very little; his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) features were large, and they and all the lines of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) frame were equally harsh and prim.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane Eyre, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div>'' Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child? '' Impossible to reply to this in the affirmative: my little world held a contrary opinion: I was silent.
<p/>Mrs. Reed answered for me by an expressive shake of the head, adding soon, <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) and I must have some talk;'' and bending from the perpendicular, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) installed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) person in the arm-chair opposite Mrs. Reed's.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sorry indeed to hear it! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Come here,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) said. I stepped across the rug; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) placed me square and straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>).
<p/>What a face he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) had, now that it was almost on a level with mine! what a great nose! and what a mouth!
<p/>and what large prominent teeth! '' No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``especially a naughty little girl.
<p/>Do you know where the wicked go after death?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' They go to hell,'' was my ready and orthodox answer. ''
<p/>And what is hell? Can you tell me that?'' '' A pit full of fire. '' '' And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?''
<p/>I deliberated a moment; my answer, when it did come, was objectionable: <div class="bookquote">``I must keep in good health, and not die.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``What must you do to avoid it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How can you keep in good health? Children younger than you die daily.
<p/>I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven.
<p/>Not being in a condition to remove his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) doubt, I only cast my eyes down on the two large feet planted on the rug, and sighed, wishing myself far enough away.
<p/>It is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called hence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Benefactress! benefactress!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I inwardly: <div class="bookquote">``they all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you say your prayers night and morning?''  (<font color='red'><b>interrogator</b></font>)</div>continued my interrogator. '' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you read your Bible?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sometimes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``With pleasure?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) says: `Oh! the verse of a Psalm!
<p/>angels sing Psalms;' says he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>), 'I wish to be a little angel here below;' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) then gets two nuts in recompense for his (<font color='blue'><b>Jonah</b></font>) infant piety.
<p/>Are you fond of it?'' <div class="bookquote">``And the Psalms? I hope you like them?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, sir.'' '' No? oh, shocking! ''
<p/>That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.
<p/>I was about to propound a question, touching the manner in which that operation of changing my heart was to be performed, when Mrs. Reed interposed, telling me to sit down; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) then proceeded to carry on the conversation herself.
<p/>Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and, above all, to guard against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) worst fault, a tendency to deceit.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Psalms are not interesting,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remarked. '' '' '' I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.
<p/>Well might I dread, well might I dislike Mrs. Reed; for it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) nature to wound me cruelly; never was I happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) presence; however carefully I obeyed, however strenuously I strove to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>), my efforts were still repulsed and repaid by such sentences as the above.
<p/>Now, uttered before a stranger, the accusation cut me to the heart; I dimly perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was already obliterating hope from the new phase of existence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) destined me to enter; I felt, though I could not have expressed the feeling, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was sowing aversion and unkindness along my future path; I saw myself transformed under Mr. Brocklehurst's eye into an artful, noxious child, and what could I do to remedy the injury?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nothing, indeed,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I, as I struggled to repress a sob, and hastily wiped away some tears, the impotent evidences of my anguish.
<p/>Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,'' said Mr. Brocklehurst; ``it is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone; she (<font color='blue'><b>child</b></font>) shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I should wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) to be brought up in a manner suiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) prospects,''  (<font color='red'><b>benefactress</b></font>)</div>continued my benefactress; <div class="bookquote">``to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) will, with your permission, spend them always at Lowood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>benefactress</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.'' '' Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,'' returned Mr. Brocklehurst.
<p/>Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.
<p/>I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.
<p/>My second daughter, Augusta, went with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mama to visit the school, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) return she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) exclaimed: `Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost like poor people's children!
<p/>'' and,' said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), `they looked at my dress and mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'
<p/>This is the state of things I quite approve,'' returned Mrs. Reed; ``had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants.
<p/>I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) position and prospects?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Madam, you may: she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and I trust she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) election.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will send her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brocklehurst/Brocklehurst</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Quite right, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>madam</b></font>)</div>No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.
<p/>I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sooner.
<p/>I shall send Miss Temple notice that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) is to expect a new girl, so that there will be no difficulty about receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>).
<p/>Good-bye.'' <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>girl</b></font>)</div><p/>Little girl, here is a book entitled the `Child's Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing `An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G--, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.'
<p/>'' With these words Mr. Brocklehurst put into my hand a thin pamphlet sewn in a cover, and having rung for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) carriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) departed.
<p/>``I will, madam. Mrs. Reed and I were left alone: some minutes passed in silence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was sewing, I was watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>).
<p/>Mrs. Reed might be at that time some six or seven and thirty; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was a woman of robust frame, square-shouldered and strong-limbed, not tall, and, though stout, not obese: she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) had a somewhat large face,
<p/>the under jaw being much developed and very solid; her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) brow was low, her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) chin large and prominent, mouth and nose sufficiently regular; under her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) light eyebrows glimmered an eye devoid of ruth; her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) skin was dark and opaque
<p/>--illness never came near her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was an exact, clever manager; her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) household and tenantry were thoroughly under her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) control; her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) children only at times defied her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) authority and laughed it to scorn; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) dressed well, and had a presence and port calculated to set off handsome attire.
<p/>, her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) hair nearly flaxen; her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) constitution was sound as a bell Sitting on a low stool, a few yards from her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) arm-chair, I examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) figure; I perused her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) features.
<p/>In my hand I held the tract containing the sudden death of the Liar, to which narrative my attention had been pointed as to an appropriate warning.
<p/>What had just passed; what Mrs. Reed had said concerning me to Mr. Brocklehurst; the whole tenor of their conversation, was recent, raw, and stinging in my mind; I had felt every word as acutely as I had heard it plainly, and a passion of resentment fomented now within me.
<p/>Mrs. Reed looked up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) work; her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) eye settled on mine, her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) fingers at the same time suspended their nimble movements.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go out of the room; return to the nursery,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) mandate. My look or something else must have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) as offensive, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) spoke with extreme though suppressed irritation.
<p/>I got up, I went to the door; I came back again; I walked to the window, across the room, then close up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>).
<p/>Speak I must : I had been trodden on severely, and must turn: but how? What strength had I to dart retaliation at my antagonist?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I do not love you
<p/>: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl, Georgiana, for it is she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) who tells lies, and not I.
<p/>I gathered my energies and launched them in this blunt sentence-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Reed's hands still lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) work inactive: her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) eye of ice continued to dwell freezingly on mine.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) asked, rather in the tone in which a person might address an opponent of adult age than such as is ordinarily used to a child.
<p/>'' What more have you to say? '' That eye of hers, that voice stirred every antipathy I had. Shaking from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable excitement, I continued--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again as long as I live.
<p/>I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and
<p/>how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth .
<p/>You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.
<p/>I shall remember how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, `Have mercy!
<p/>Have mercy, Aunt Reed!' And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.
<p/>I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale. People think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted.
<p/>p30.jpg-RCB- Ere I had finished this reply, my soul began to expand, to exult, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt.
<p/>You are deceitful! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LCB-How dare I, Mrs. Reed? How dare I? Because it is the truth: It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into unhoped- for liberty.
<p/>Not without cause was this sentiment: Mrs. Reed looked frightened; her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) work had slipped from her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) knee; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was lifting up her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) hands, rocking herself to and fro, and even twisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) face as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) would cry.
<p/>'' Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you? Why do you tremble so violently? Would you like to drink some water?''
<p/>'' No, Mrs. Reed. '' <div class="bookquote">``Is there anything else you wish for, Jane? I assure you, I desire to be your friend.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brocklehurst/Brocklehurst</b></font>)</div><p/>You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what you have done.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div>Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for their faults.'' ``Deceit is not my fault!
<p/>But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little.
<p/>``I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will indeed send her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) to school soon,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>murmured Mrs. Reed sotto voce ; and gathering up her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) work, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) abruptly quitted the apartment.
<p/>It was the hardest battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained: I stood awhile on the rug, where Mr. Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's solitude.
<p/>First, I smiled to myself and felt elate; but this fierce pleasure subsided in me as fast as did the accelerated throb of my pulses.
<p/>A child cannot quarrel with its elders, as I had done; cannot give its furious feelings uncontrolled play, as I had given mine, without experiencing afterwards the pang of remorse and the chill of reaction.
<p/>A ridge of lighted heath, alive, glancing, devouring, would have been a meet emblem of my mind when I accused and menaced Mrs. Reed: the same ridge, black and blasted after the flames are dead, would have represented as meetly my subsequent condition, when half-an-hour's silence and reflection had shown me the madness of my conduct, and the dreariness of my hated and hating position.
<p/>Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after-flavour, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned.
<p/>Willingly would I now have gone and asked Mrs. Reed's pardon; but I knew, partly from experience and partly from instinct, that was the way to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) repulse me with double scorn, thereby re-exciting every turbulent impulse of my nature.
<p/>I would fain exercise some better faculty than that of fierce speaking; fain find nourishment for some less fiendish feeling than that of sombre indignation.
<p/>'' I cried out in a savage, high voice. '' '' '' I was left there alone--winner of the field. I took a book--some Arabian tales; I sat down and endeavoured to read.
<p/>I could make no sense of the subject; my own thoughts swam always between me and the page I had usually found fascinating.
<p/>I opened the glass-door in the breakfast-room: the shrubbery was quite still: the black frost reigned, unbroken by sun or breeze, through the grounds.
<p/>I covered my head and arms with the skirt of my frock, and went out to walk in a part of the plantation which was quite sequestrated; but I found no pleasure in the silent trees, the falling fir-cones, the congealed relics of autumn, russet leaves, swept by past winds in heaps, and now stiffened together.
<p/>I leaned against a gate, and looked into an empty field where no sheep were feeding, where the short grass was nipped and blanched.
<p/>It was a very grey day; a most opaque sky, <div class="bookquote">``onding on snaw,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>canopied all; thence flakes felt it intervals, which settled on the hard path and on the hoary lea without melting.
<p/>I stood, a wretched child enough, whispering to myself over and over again, <div class="bookquote">``What shall I do?--what shall I do? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>All at once I heard a clear voice call, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Jane! where are you? Come to lunch! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was Bessie, I knew well enough; but I did not stir; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) light step came tripping down the path.
<p/>Bessie's presence, compared with the thoughts over which I had been brooding, seemed cheerful; even though, as usual, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was somewhat cross.
<p/>The fact is, after my conflict with and victory over Mrs. Reed, I was not disposed to care much for the nursemaid's transitory anger; and I was disposed to bask in her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) youthful lightness of heart.
<p/>'' You naughty little thing! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) said. '' Why don't you come when you are called? '' I just put my two arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) and said, <div class="bookquote">``Come, Bessie!
<p/>don't scold. ''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>The action was more frank and fearless than any I was habituated to indulge in: somehow it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>).
<p/>You are a strange child, Miss Jane,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) looked down at me; <div class="bookquote">``a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I suppose?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' I nodded. '' And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?'' '' What does Bessie care for me?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) is always scolding me.'' <div class="bookquote">``Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing. You should be bolder. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What! to get more knocks?''
 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>My mother said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) came to see me last week, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would not like a little one of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news for you.''
<p/>``Nonsense! But you are rather put upon, that's certain. <div class="bookquote">``I don't think you have, Bessie. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Child! what do you mean?
<p/>Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.
<p/>I'll ask cook to bake you a little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk.
<p/>Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>What sorrowful eyes you fix on me! <div class="bookquote">``Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of me. Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so provoking.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to dread.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``If you dread them they'll dislike you.''  (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div>'' As you do, Bessie?'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the others.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You don't show it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking. What makes you so venturesome and hardy?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--I was going to say something about what had passed between me and Mrs. Reed, but on second thoughts I considered it better to remain silent on that head.
<p/>'' And so you're glad to leave me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not at all, Bessie ; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just now!
<p/>I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say you'd rather not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>and rather! How coolly my little lady says it! <div class="bookquote">``I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div>Bessie stooped; we mutually embraced, and I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) into the house quite comforted.
<p/>That afternoon lapsed in peace and harmony; and in the evening Bessie told me some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) most enchanting stories, and sang me some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) sweetest songs.
<p/>CHAPTER V Five o'clock had hardly struck on the morning of the 19th of January, when Bessie brought a candle into my closet and found me already up and nearly dressed.
<p/>I had risen half-an-hour before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) entrance, and had washed my face, and put on my clothes by the light of a half-moon just setting, whose rays streamed through the narrow window near my crib.
<p/>Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine. I was to leave Gateshead that day by a coach which passed the lodge gates at six a.m.
<p/>Bessie was the only person yet risen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had lit a fire in the nursery, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) now proceeded to make my breakfast.
<p/>Few children can eat when excited with the thoughts of a journey; nor could I. Bessie, having pressed me in vain to take a few spoonfuls of the boiled milk and bread she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had prepared for me, wrapped up some biscuits in a paper and put them into my bag; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) helped me on with my pelisse and bonnet, and wrapping herself in a shawl, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) and I left the nursery.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) in the morning, or my cousins either; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) told me to remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had always been my best friend, and to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) and be grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) accordingly.
<p/>As we passed Mrs. Reed's bedroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Will you go in and bid Missis good- bye?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Bessie: ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What did you say, Miss?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) to the wall.'' '' That was wrong, Miss Jane.''
<p/>'' It was quite right, Bessie. Your Missis has not been my friend: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) has been my foe.'' <div class="bookquote">``O Miss Jane! don't say so!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The moon was set, and it was very dark; Bessie carried a lantern, whose light glanced on wet steps and gravel road sodden by a recent thaw.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Good-bye to Gateshead! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>cried I, as we passed through the hall and went out at the front door. Raw and chill was the winter morning
<p/>There was a light in the porter's lodge: when we reached it, we found the porter's wife just kindling her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fire: my trunk, which had been carried down the evening before, stood corded at the door.
<p/>a few minutes of six, and shortly after that hour had struck, the distant roll of wheels announced the coming coach
<p/>: my teeth chattered as I hastened down the drive. It wanted but ; I went to the door and watched its lamps approach rapidly through the gloom.
<p/>'' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) going by herself? '' asked the porter's wife. '' Yes.'' '' And how far is it? '' <div class="bookquote">``Fifty miles.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What a long way! I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) so far alone. '' The coach drew up; there it was at the gates with its four horses and its top laden with passengers:
<p/>the guard and coachman loudly urged haste; my trunk was hoisted up; I was taken from Bessie's neck, to which I clung with kisses.
<p/>'' Be sure and take good care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>),'' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) to the guard, as he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) lifted me into the inside.
<p/>Thus was I severed from Bessie and Gateshead; thus whirled away to unknown, and, as I then deemed, remote and mysterious regions.
<p/>I remember but little of the journey; I only know that the day seemed to me of a preternatural length, and that we appeared to travel over hundreds of miles of road.
<p/>We passed through several towns, and in one, a very large one, the coach stopped; the horses were taken out, and the passengers alighted to dine.
<p/>I was carried into an inn, where the guard wanted me to have some dinner; but, as I had no appetite, he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) left me in an immense room with a fireplace at each end, a chandelier pendent from the ceiling, and a little red gallery high up against the wall filled with musical instruments.
<p/>Here I walked about for a long time, feeling very strange, and mortally apprehensive of some one coming in and kidnapping me; for I believed in kidnappers, their exploits having frequently figured in Bessie's fireside chronicles.
<p/>At last the guard returned; once more I was stowed away in the coach, my protector mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) own seat, sounded his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) hollow horn, and away we rattled over the <div class="bookquote">``stony street''  (<font color='red'><b>protector</b></font>)</div>of L-.
<p/>The afternoon came on wet and somewhat misty: as it waned into dusk, I began to feel that we were getting very far indeed from Gateshead: we ceased to pass through towns; the country changed; great grey hills heaved up round the horizon: as twilight deepened, we descended a valley, dark with wood, and long after night had overclouded the prospect, I heard a wild wind rushing amongst trees.
<p/>Lulled by the sound, I at last dropped asleep; I had not long slumbered when the sudden cessation of motion awoke me; the coach-door was open, and a person like a servant was standing at it:
<p/>'' Ay, ay!'' was the answer: the door was slapped to, a voice exclaimed <div class="bookquote">``All right,''  (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div>and on we drove. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) face and dress by the light of the lamps.
<p/>'' Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) asked. I answered <div class="bookquote">``Yes,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and was then lifted out; my trunk was handed down, and the coach instantly drove away.
<p/>I was stiff with long sitting, and bewildered with the noise and motion of the coach: Gathering my faculties, I looked about me.
<p/>Rain, wind, and darkness filled the air; nevertheless, I dimly discerned a wall before me and a door open in it; through this door I passed with my new guide: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) shut and locked it behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>).
<p/>There was now visible a house or houses--for the building spread far--with many windows, and lights burning in some; we went up a broad pebbly path, splashing wet, and were admitted at a door; then the servant led me through a passage into a room with a fire, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) left me alone.
<p/>, then I looked round; there was no candle, but the uncertain light from the hearth showed, by intervals, papered walls, carpet, curtains, shining mahogany furniture
<p/>I stood and warmed my numbed fingers over the blaze : it was a parlour, not so spacious or splendid as the drawing-room at Gateshead, but comfortable enough.
<p/>I was puzzling to make out the subject of a picture on the wall, when the door opened, and an individual carrying a light entered; another followed close behind.
<p/>The first was a tall lady with dark hair, dark eyes, and a pale and large forehead; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) figure was partly enveloped in a shawl, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) countenance was grave, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) bearing erect.
<p/>'' The child is very young to be sent alone,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), putting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) candle down on the table. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) considered me attentively for a minute or two, then further added--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had better be put to bed soon; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looks tired: are you tired? ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked, placing her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand on my shoulder.
<p/>'' A little, ma'am. '' '' And hungry too, no doubt: let her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) have some supper before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) goes to bed, Miss Miller.
<p/>Is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school, my little girl? '' I explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) that I had no parents.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) inquired how long they had been dead: then how old I was, what was my name, whether I could read, write, and sew a little: then she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) touched my cheek gently with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forefinger, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) hoped I should be a good child,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>dismissed me along with Miss Miller.
<p/>The lady I had left might be about twenty-nine; the one who went with me appeared some years younger: the first impressed me by her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice, look, and air.
<p/>Miss Miller was more ordinary; ruddy in complexion, though of a careworn countenance; hurried in gait and action, like one who had always a multiplicity of tasks on hand: she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) looked, indeed, what I afterwards found she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) really was, an under-teacher.
<p/>Led by her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>), I passed from compartment to compartment, from passage to passage, of a large and irregular building; till, emerging from the total and somewhat dreary silence pervading that portion of the house we had traversed, we came upon the hum of many voices, and presently entered a wide, long room, with great deal tables, two at each end, on each of which burnt a pair of candles, and seated all round on benches, a congregation of girls of every age, from nine or ten to twenty.
<p/>Seen by the dim light of the dips, their number to me appeared countless, though not in reality exceeding eighty; they were uniformly dressed in brown stuff frocks of quaint fashion, and long holland pinafores.
<p/>It was the hour of study; they were engaged in conning over their to-morrow's task, and the hum I had heard was the combined result of their whispered repetitions.
<p/>Miss Miller signed to me to sit on a bench near the door, then walking up to the top of the long room
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) cried out-- <div class="bookquote">``Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Four tall girls arose from different tables, and going round, gathered the books and removed them.
<p/>The tall girls went out and returned presently, each bearing a tray, with portions of something, I knew not what, arranged thereon, and a pitcher of water and mug in the middle of each tray.
<p/>Miss Miller again gave the word of command-- <div class="bookquote">``Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller</b></font>)</div>The portions were handed round; those who liked took a draught of the water, the mug being common to all.
<p/>When it came to my turn, I drank, for I was thirsty, but did not touch the food, excitement and fatigue rendering me incapable of eating: I now saw, however, that it was a thin oaten cake shared into fragments.
<p/>Overpowered by this time with weariness, I scarcely noticed what sort of a place the bedroom was, except that, like the schoolroom, I saw it was very long.
<p/>To-night I was to be Miss Miller's bed-fellow; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) helped me to undress: when laid down I glanced at the long rows of beds, each of which was quickly filled with two occupants; in ten minutes the single light was extinguished, and amidst silence and complete darkness I fell asleep.
<p/>The meal over, prayers were read by Miss Miller, and the classes filed off, two and two, upstairs. The night passed rapidly.
<p/>I was too tired even to dream; I only once awoke to hear the wind rave in furious gusts, and the rain fall in torrents, and to be sensible that Miss Miller had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) place by my side.
<p/>When I again unclosed my eyes, a loud bell was ringing; the girls were up and dressing; day had not yet begun to dawn, and a rushlight or two burned in the room.
<p/>I too rose reluctantly; it was bitter cold, and I dressed as well as I could for shivering, and washed when there was a basin at liberty, which did not occur soon, as there was but one basin to six girls, on the stands down the middle of the room.
<p/>all formed in file, two and two, and in that order descended the stairs and entered the cold and dimly lit schoolroom: here prayers were read by Miss Miller; afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) called out--
<p/>Again the bell rang: <div class="bookquote">``Form classes! ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>A great tumult succeeded for some minutes, during which Miss Miller repeatedly exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``Order!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>When it subsided, I saw them all drawn up in four semicircles, before four chairs, placed at the four tables; all held books in their hands, and a great book, like a Bible, lay on each table, before the vacant seat.
<p/>A pause of some seconds succeeded, filled up by the low, vague hum of numbers; Miss Miller walked from class to class, hushing this indefinite sound.
<p/>Miss Miller assumed the fourth vacant chair, which was that nearest the door, and around which the smallest of the children were assembled: to this inferior class I was called, and placed at the bottom of it.
<p/>Business now began, the day's Collect was repeated, then certain texts of Scripture were said, and to these succeeded a protracted reading of chapters in the Bible, which lasted an hour.
<p/>A distant bell tinkled: immediately three ladies entered the room, each walked to a table and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) seat. By the time that exercise was terminated, day had fully dawned.
<p/>The indefatigable bell now sounded for the fourth time: the classes were marshalled and marched into another room to breakfast: how glad I was to behold a prospect of getting something to eat!
<p/>The refectory was a great, low-ceiled, gloomy room; on two long tables smoked basins of something hot, which, however, to my dismay, sent forth an odour far from inviting.
<p/>I saw a universal manifestation of discontent when the fumes of the repast met the nostrils of those destined to swallow it; from the van of the procession, the tall girls of the first class, rose the whispered words--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Silence!''  (<font color='red'><b>the girls</b></font>)</div>ejaculated a voice; not that of Miss Miller, but one of the upper teachers, a little and dark personage, smartly dressed, but of somewhat morose aspect, who installed herself at the top of one table, while a more buxom lady presided at the other.
<p/>I was now nearly sick from inanition, having taken so little the day before. <div class="bookquote">``Disgusting! The porridge is burnt again!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I looked in vain for her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
<p/>I had first seen the night before; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not visible: Miss Miller occupied the foot of the table where I sat, and a strange, foreign-looking, elderly lady, the French teacher, as I afterwards found, took the corresponding seat at the other board.
<p/>A long grace was said and a hymn sung; then a servant brought in some tea for the teachers, and the meal began.
<p/>Ravenous, and now very faint, I devoured a spoonful or two of my portion without thinking of its taste; but the first edge of hunger blunted, I perceived I had got in hand a nauseous mess; burnt porridge is almost as bad as rotten potatoes; famine itself soon sickens over it.
<p/>The spoons were moved slowly: I saw each girl taste her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) food and try to swallow it; but in most cases the effort was soon relinquished.
<p/>Thanks being returned for what we had not got, and a second hymn chanted, the refectory was evacuated for the schoolroom.
<p/>I was one of the last to go out, and in passing the tables, I saw one teacher take a basin of the porridge and taste it; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked at the others; all their countenances expressed displeasure, and one of them, the stout one, whispered-- <div class="bookquote">``Abominable stuff!
<p/>A quarter of an hour passed before lessons again began, during which the schoolroom was in a glorious tumult; for that space of time it seemed to be permitted to talk loud and more freely, and they used their privilege.
<p/>Breakfast was over, and none had breakfasted. How shameful! ''  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>The whole conversation ran on the breakfast, which one and all abused roundly.
<p/>Miss Miller was now the only teacher in the room: a group of great girls standing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) spoke with serious and sullen gestures.
<p/>I heard the name of Mr. Brocklehurst pronounced by some lips; at which Miss Miller shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) head disapprovingly; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) made no great effort to check the general wrath; doubtless she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) shared in it.
<p/>A clock in the schoolroom struck nine; Miss Miller left her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) circle, and standing in the middle of the room, cried-- <div class="bookquote">``Silence!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller</b></font>)</div>Discipline prevailed: in five minutes the confused throng was resolved into order, and comparative silence quelled the Babel clamour of tongues.
<p/>Poor things! it was the sole consolation they had. To your seats! The upper teachers now punctually resumed their posts: but still, all seemed to wait.
<p/>Ranged on benches down the sides of the room, the eighty girls sat motionless and erect; a quaint assemblage they appeared, all with plain locks combed from their faces, not a curl visible; in brown dresses, made high and surrounded by a narrow tucker about the throat, with little pockets of holland -LRB-shaped something like a Highlander's purse-RRB- tied in front of their frocks, and destined to serve the purpose of a work-bag: all, too, wearing woollen stockings and country-made shoes, fastened with brass buckles.
<p/>Above twenty of those clad in this costume were full-grown girls, or rather young women; it suited them ill, and gave an air of oddity even to the prettiest.
<p/>I was still looking at them, and also at intervals examining the teachers--none of whom precisely pleased me; for the stout one was a little coarse, the dark one not a little fierce, the foreigner harsh and grotesque, and Miss Miller, poor thing!
<p/>looked purple, weather-beaten, and over-worked--when, as my eye wandered from face to face, the whole school rose simultaneously, as if moved by a common spring.
<p/>Ere I had gathered my wits, the classes were again seated: but as all eyes were now turned to one point, mine followed the general direction, and encountered the personage who had received me last night.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) stood at the bottom of the long room, on the hearth; for there was a fire at each end; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) surveyed the two rows of girls silently and gravely.
<p/>Miss Miller approaching, seemed to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) a question, and having received her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) answer, went back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) place, and said aloud-- <div class="bookquote">``Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Miller</b></font>)</div><p/>What was the matter? I had heard no order given: I was puzzled. While the direction was being executed, the lady consulted moved slowly up the room.
<p/>I suppose I have a considerable organ of veneration, for I retain yet the sense of admiring awe with which my eyes traced her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) steps.
<p/>Seen now, in broad daylight, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked tall, fair, and shapely; brown eyes with a benignant light in their irids, and a fine pencilling of long lashes round, relieved the whiteness of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) large front; on each of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) temples her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hair, of a very dark brown, was clustered in round curls, according to the fashion of those times, when neither smooth bands nor long ringlets were in vogue; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dress, also in the mode of the day, was of purple cloth, relieved by a sort of Spanish trimming of black velvet; a gold watch -LRB-watches were not so common then as now-RRB- shone at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) girdle.
<p/>Let the reader add, to complete the picture, refined features; a complexion, if pale, clear; and a stately air and carriage, and he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) will have, at least, as clearly as words can give it, a correct idea of the exterior of Miss Temple--Maria Temple, as I afterwards saw the name written in a prayer-book intrusted to me to carry to church.
<p/>The superintendent of Lowood -LRB-for such was this lady-RRB- having taken her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seat before a pair of globes placed on one of the tables, summoned the first class round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and commenced giving a lesson on geography; the lower classes were called by the teachers: repetitions in history, grammar, &c., went on for an hour; writing and arithmetic succeeded, and music lessons were given by Miss Temple to some of the elder girls.
<p/>The duration of each lesson was measured by the clock, which at last struck twelve. The superintendent rose-- <div class="bookquote">``I have a word to address to the pupils,''  (<font color='red'><b>The superintendent</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>The tumult of cessation from lessons was already breaking forth, but it sank at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) went on-- '' You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be hungry:--I
<p/>have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all. '' The teachers looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with a sort of surprise.
<p/>It is to be done on my responsibility,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) added, in an explanatory tone to them, and immediately afterwards left the room.
<p/>'' The bread and cheese was presently brought in and distributed, to the high delight and refreshment of the whole school.
<p/>The order was now given <div class="bookquote">``To the garden!''  (<font color='red'><b>calico</b></font>)</div>Each put on a coarse straw bonnet, with strings of coloured calico, and a cloak of grey frieze.
<p/>The garden was a wide inclosure, surrounded with walls so high as to exclude every glimpse of prospect; a covered verandah ran down one side, and broad walks bordered a middle space divided into scores of little beds: these beds were assigned as gardens for the pupils to cultivate, and each bed had an owner.
<p/>When full of flowers they would doubtless look pretty; but now, at the latter end of January, all was wintry blight and brown decay.
<p/>I shuddered as I stood and looked round me: it was an inclement day for outdoor exercise; not positively rainy, but darkened by a drizzling yellow fog; all under foot was still soaking wet with the floods of yesterday.
<p/>The stronger among the girls ran about and engaged in active games, but sundry pale and thin ones herded together for shelter and warmth in the verandah; and amongst these, as the dense mist penetrated to their shivering frames, I heard frequently the sound of a hollow cough.
<p/>As yet I had spoken to no one, nor did anybody seem to take notice of me; I stood lonely enough: but to that feeling of isolation I was accustomed; it did not oppress me much.
<p/>I leant against a pillar of the verandah, drew my grey mantle close about me, and, trying to forget the cold which nipped me without, and the unsatisfied hunger which gnawed me within, delivered myself up to the employment of watching and thinking.
<p/>My reflections were too undefined and fragmentary to merit record: I hardly yet knew where I was; Gateshead and my past life seemed floated away to an immeasurable distance; the present was vague and strange, and of the future I could form no conjecture.
<p/>I looked round the convent-like garden, and then up at the house--a large building, half of which seemed grey and old, the other half quite new.
<p/>The new part, containing the schoolroom and dormitory, was lit by mullioned and latticed windows, which gave it a church-like aspect; a stone tablet over the door bore this inscription:--
<p/>I was similarly equipped, and, following the stream, I made my way into the open air. <div class="bookquote">``Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. --, by Naomi Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.'' (<font color='red'><b>St. Matt</b></font>)</div>--St.
<p/>Matt. v. 16. I read these words over and over again : I felt that an explanation belonged to them, and was unable fully to penetrate their import.
<p/>I was still pondering the signification of <div class="bookquote">``Institution,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and endeavouring to make out a connection between the first words and the verse of Scripture, when the sound of a cough close behind me made me turn my head.
<p/>I saw a girl sitting on a stone bench near; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was bent over a book, on the perusal of which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) seemed intent: from where I stood I could see the title--it was <div class="bookquote">``Rasselas;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>a name that struck me as strange, and consequently attractive.
<p/>In turning a leaf she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) happened to look up, and I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) directly-- <div class="bookquote">``Is your book interesting? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had already formed the intention of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to lend it to me some day.
<p/>'' I like it,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered, after a pause of a second or two, during which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) examined me. '' What is it about?
<p/>I hardly know where I found the hardihood thus to open a conversation with a stranger; the step was contrary to my nature and habits: but I think her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) occupation touched a chord of sympathy somewhere; for I too liked reading, though of a frivolous and childish kind; I could not digest or comprehend the serious or substantial.
<p/>'' I continued. '' You may look at it,'' replied the girl, offering me the book. I did so; a brief examination convinced me that the contents were less taking than the title:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rasselas''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>looked dull to my trifling taste; I saw nothing about fairies, nothing about genii; no bright variety seemed spread over the closely-printed pages.
<p/>I returned it to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) received it quietly, and without saying anything she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was about to relapse into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) former studious mood: again I ventured to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means? What is Lowood Institution?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' This house where you are come to live.''
<p/>'' And why do they call it Institution? Is it in any way different from other schools?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are charity-children.
<p/>I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your father or your mother dead?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Both died before I can remember.
<p/>Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this is called an institution for educating orphans.''
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Do we pay no money? Do they keep us for nothing?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Then why do they call us charity-children?'' '' Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the deficiency is supplied by subscription.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Who subscribes?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in London. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Naomi Brocklehurst</b></font>)</div>'' Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?'' ''
<p/>The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records, and whose son overlooks and directs everything here.''
<p/>Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is treasurer and manager of the establishment.

<p/>The odour which now filled the refectory was scarcely more appetising than that which had regaled our nostrils at breakfast: the dinner was served in two huge tin-plated vessels, whence rose a strong steam redolent of rancid fat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But at that moment the summons sounded for dinner; all re-entered the house. I found the mess to consist of indifferent potatoes and strange shreds of rusty meat, mixed and cooked together.
<p/>Of this preparation a tolerably abundant plateful was apportioned to each pupil. I ate what I could, and wondered within myself whether every day's fare would be like this.
<p/>The only marked event of the afternoon was, that I saw the girl with whom I had conversed in the verandah dismissed in disgrace by Miss Scatcherd from a history class, and sent to stand in the middle of the large schoolroom.
<p/>After dinner, we immediately adjourned to the schoolroom: lessons recommenced, and were continued till five o'clock. The punishment seemed to me in a high degree ignominious, especially for so great a girl--
<p/>I expected she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would show signs of great distress and shame; but to my surprise she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neither wept nor blushed: composed, though grave
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked thirteen or upwards. , she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stood, the central mark of all eyes. '' How can she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bear it so quietly--so firmly?
<p/>'' I asked of myself. '' Were I in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were thinking of something beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) punishment--beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) situation: of something not round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nor before her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it--her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sight seems turned in, gone down into her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is looking at what she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can remember, I believe; not at what is really present.
<p/>I have heard of day-dreams--is she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in a day-dream now? I wonder what sort of a girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is--whether good or naughty.
<p/>'' Soon after five p.m. we had another meal, consisting of a small mug of coffee, and half-a-slice of brown bread.
<p/>I devoured my bread and drank my coffee with relish; but I should have been glad of as much more --I was still hungry.
<p/>Half-an-hour's recreation succeeded, then study; then the glass of water and the piece of oat-cake, prayers, and bed. Such was my first day at Lowood.
<p/>The next day commenced as before, getting up and dressing by rushlight; but this morning we were obliged to dispense with the ceremony of washing; the water in the pitchers was frozen.
<p/>A change had taken place in the weather the preceding evening, and a keen north-east wind, whistling through the crevices of our bedroom windows all night long, had made us shiver in our beds, and turned the contents of the ewers to ice.
<p/>CHAPTER VI Before the long hour and a half of prayers and Bible-reading was over, I felt ready to perish with cold.
<p/>Breakfast-time came at last, and this morning the porridge was not burnt; the quality was eatable, the quantity small. How small my portion seemed!
<p/>In the course of the day I was enrolled a member of the fourth class, and regular tasks and occupations were assigned me:
<p/>I wished it had been doubled. hitherto, I had only been a spectator of the proceedings at Lowood; I was now to become an actor therein.
<p/>At first, being little accustomed to learn by heart, the lessons appeared to me both long and difficult; the frequent change from task to task, too, bewildered me; and I was glad when, about three o'clock in the afternoon, Miss Smith put into my hands a border of muslin two yards long, together with needle, thimble, &c., and sent me to sit in a quiet corner of the schoolroom, with directions to hem the same.
<p/>At that hour most of the others were sewing likewise; but one class still stood round Miss Scatcherd's chair reading, and as all was quiet, the subject of their lessons could be heard, together with the manner in which each girl acquitted herself, and the animadversions or commendations of Miss Scatcherd on the performance.
<p/>It was English history: among the readers I observed my acquaintance of the verandah: at the commencement of the lesson, her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) place had been at the top of the class, but for some error of pronunciation, or some inattention to stops, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) was suddenly sent to the very bottom.
<p/>Even in that obscure position, Miss Scatcherd continued to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) an object of constant notice: she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) was continually addressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) such phrases as the following:-- <div class="bookquote">``Burns''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-such it seems was her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) name: the girls here were all called by their surnames, as boys are elsewhere-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``Burns, you are standing on the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.''
 (<font color='red'><b>boys</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Burns, I insist on your holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>&c. &
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Burns, you poke your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>c. A chapter having been read through twice, the books were closed and the girls examined.
<p/>The lesson had comprised part of the reign of Charles I., and there were sundry questions about tonnage and poundage and ship- money, which most of them appeared unable to answer; still, every little difficulty was solved instantly when it reached Burns: her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) memory seemed to have retained the substance of the whole lesson, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) was ready with answers on every point.
<p/>I kept expecting that Miss Scatcherd would praise her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) attention; but, instead of that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) suddenly cried out-- <div class="bookquote">``You dirty, disagreeable girl!
<p/>Why,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought I, <div class="bookquote">``does she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) not explain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) could neither clean her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) nails nor wash her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) face, as the water was frozen?
<p/>My attention was now called off by Miss Smith desiring me to hold a skein of thread: while she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was winding it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) talked to me from time to time, asking whether I had ever been at school before, whether I could mark, stitch, knit, &c.
<p/>you have never cleaned your nails this morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Burns made no answer: I wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) silence. '' '' ; till she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) dismissed me, I could not pursue my observations on Miss Scatcherd's movements.
<p/>When I returned to my seat, that lady was just delivering an order of which I did not catch the import; but Burns immediately left the class, and going into the small inner room where the books were kept, returned in half a minute, carrying in her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) hand a bundle of twigs tied together at one end.
<p/>This ominous tool she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) presented to Miss Scatcherd with a respectful curtesy; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) quietly, and without being told, unloosed her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) pinafore, and the teacher instantly and sharply inflicted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) neck a dozen strokes with the bunch of twigs.
<p/>Not a tear rose to Burns' eye; and, while I paused from my sewing, because my fingers quivered at this spectacle with a sentiment of unavailing and impotent anger, not a feature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) pensive face altered its ordinary expression.
<p/>Burns obeyed: I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) narrowly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) emerged from the book-closet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) was just putting back her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) handkerchief into her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) pocket, and the trace of a tear glistened on her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) thin cheek.
<p/>'' Hardened girl!'' exclaimed Miss Scatcherd; <div class="bookquote">``nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Scatcherd</b></font>)</div>The play-hour in the evening
<p/>I thought the pleasantest fraction of the day at Lowood: the bit of bread, the draught of coffee swallowed at five o'clock had revived vitality, if it had not satisfied hunger: the long restraint of the day was slackened; the schoolroom felt warmer than in the morning--its fires being allowed to burn a little more brightly, to supply, in some measure, the place of candles, not yet introduced: the ruddy gloaming, the licensed uproar, the confusion of many voices gave one a welcome sense of liberty.
<p/>On the evening of the day on which I had seen Miss Scatcherd flog her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) pupil, Burns, I wandered as usual among the forms and tables and laughing groups without a companion, yet not feeling lonely: when I passed the windows,
<p/>I now and then lifted a blind, and looked out; it snowed fast, a drift was already forming against the lower panes; putting my ear close to the window, I could distinguish from the gleeful tumult within, the disconsolate moan of the wind outside.
<p/>Probably, if I had lately left a good home and kind parents, this would have been the hour when I should most keenly have regretted the separation; that wind would then have saddened my heart; this obscure chaos would have disturbed my peace!
<p/>as it was, I derived from both a strange excitement, and reckless and feverish, I wished the wind to howl more wildly, the gloom to deepen to darkness, and the confusion to rise to clamour.
<p/>Jumping over forms, and creeping under tables, I made my way to one of the fire-places; there, kneeling by the high wire fender, I found Burns, absorbed, silent, abstracted from all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) by the companionship of a book, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) read by the dim glare of the embers.
<p/>'' Is it still `Rasselas'? '' I asked, coming behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>). '' Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and I have just finished it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in five minutes more she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) shut it up. I was glad of this. '' Now,'' thought I, <div class="bookquote">``I can perhaps get her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) to talk.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) on the floor. '' What is your name besides Burns?'' <div class="bookquote">``Helen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you come a long way from here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Will you ever go back?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must wish to leave Lowood?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No! why should I? '' But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cruel? Not at all! She (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) is severe: she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) dislikes my faults.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' And if I were in your place I should dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>); I should resist her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>).
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) struck me with that rod, I should get it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) hand; I should break it under her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) nose.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief to your relations.
<p/>It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.''
 (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div><p/>But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am far younger than you, and I could not bear it.''
<p/>if you could not avoid it: it is weak and silly to say you cannot bear what it is your fate to be required to bear.
<p/>I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with wonder: I could not comprehend this doctrine of endurance; and still less could I understand or sympathise with the forbearance she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) expressed for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chastiser.
<p/>'' '' Yet it would be your duty to bear it, '' Still I felt that Helen Burns considered things by a light invisible to my eyes.
<p/>I suspected she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) might be right and I wrong; but I would not ponder the matter deeply; like Felix, I put it off to a more convenient season.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot bear to be subjected to systematic arrangements.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen/Helen Burns/Burns</b></font>)</div>You say you have faults, Helen: what are they? To me you seem very good.'' This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular.''
<p/>'' And cross and cruel,'' I added; but Helen Burns would not admit my addition: she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) kept silence. <div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?
<p/>Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) to be severe to any one, even the worst in the school: she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) sees my errors, and tells me of them gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) gives me my meed liberally.
<p/>One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that even her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure me of my faults; and even her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) praise, though I value it most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Temple</b></font>)</div><p/>'' At the utterance of Miss Temple's name, a soft smile flitted over her (<font color='blue'><b>Temple</b></font>) grave face. '' '' That is curious,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``it is so easy to be careful.
<p/>I observed you in your class this morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.
<p/>Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd, and collecting all she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) voice; I fall into a sort of dream.
<p/>Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no answer ready.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``For you I have no doubt it is. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yet how well you replied this afternoon.'' '' It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me.
<p/>This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) integrity and conscientiousness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had but been able to look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending!
<p/>Still, I like Charles--I respect him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)-- I pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), poor murdered king! Yes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right to shed.
<p/>Helen was talking to herself now: she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had forgotten I could not very well understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>)--that I was ignorant, or nearly so, of the subject she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) discussed.
<p/>How dared they kill him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)!'' I recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) to my level. '' And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?''
<p/>No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections; her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) language is singularly agreeable to me, and the information she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) communicates is often just what I wished to gain.
<p/>'' '' '' Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides me.
<p/>There is no merit in such goodness.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you. It is all I ever desire to be.
<p/>If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse.
<p/>When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are but a little untaught girl.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly.
<p/>It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised nations disown it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``How? I don't understand. ''

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) turn, Helen Burns asked me to explain, and I proceeded forthwith to pour out, in my own way, the tale of my sufferings and resentments.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Bitter and truculent when excited, I spoke as I felt, without reserve or softening. Helen heard me patiently to the end: I expected she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) would then make a remark, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said nothing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) dislikes your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you remember all she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) has done and said to you!
<p/>'' Well,'' I asked impatiently, <div class="bookquote">``is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad woman?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' What a singularly deep impression her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) injustice seems to have made on your heart!
<p/>No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings. Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) severity, together with the passionate emotions it excited?
<p/>We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!
<p/>Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs. Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?
<p/>No; I cannot believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.
<p/>Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last:
<p/>, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end.
<p/>with this creed revenge never worries my heart '' Helen's head, always drooping, sank a little lower as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) finished this sentence.
<p/>I saw by her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) look she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) wished no longer to talk to me, but rather to converse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own thoughts.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was not allowed much time for meditation: a monitor, a great rough girl, presently came up, exclaiming in a strong Cumberland accent-- <div class="bookquote">``Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!''
 (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div><p/>My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks.
<p/>The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.
<p/>During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air.
<p/>Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there
<p/>: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning.
<p/>Then the scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid.
<p/>From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion.
<p/>Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.
<p/>Helen sighed as her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) reverie fled, and getting up, obeyed the monitor without reply as without delay. CHAPTER VII Sundays were dreary days in that wintry season.
<p/>We had to walk two miles to Brocklebridge Church, where our patron officiated. We set out cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost paralysed.
<p/>It was too far to return to dinner, and an allowance of cold meat and bread, in the same penurious proportion observed in our ordinary meals, was served round between the services.
<p/>At the close of the afternoon service we returned by an exposed and hilly road, where the bitter winter wind, blowing over a range of snowy summits to the north, almost flayed the skin from our faces.
<p/>I can remember Miss Temple walking lightly and rapidly along our drooping line, her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) plaid cloak, which the frosty wind fluttered, gathered close about her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>), and encouraging us, by precept and example, to keep up our spirits, and march forward, as she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``like stalwart soldiers.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others. How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!
<p/>But, to the little ones at least, this was denied: each hearth in the schoolroom was immediately surrounded by a double row of great girls, and behind them the younger children crouched in groups, wrapping their starved arms in their pinafores.
<p/>A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of bread--a whole, instead of a half, slice--with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath.
<p/>I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.
<p/>The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) weariness.
<p/>A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead.
<p/>The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished.
<p/>Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors' high stools.
<p/>I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) stay with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) friend the archdeacon: his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) absence was a relief to me.
<p/>One afternoon -LRB-I had then been three weeks at Lowood-RRB-, as I was sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose en masse , it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted.
<p/>A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead.
<p/>I need not say that I had my own reasons for dreading his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) coming: but come he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) did at last. I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture.
<p/>Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.
<p/>I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition, &c.;
<p/>All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise,--I had been looking out daily for the <div class="bookquote">``Coming Man,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) was.
<p/>the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) stood at Miss Temple's side; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) was speaking low in her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) ear:
<p/>I did not doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt.
<p/>I listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.
<p/>I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match.
<p/>You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) shall have some papers sent in next week; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them.
<p/>I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in them
<p/>'' And, O ma'am! I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!--when I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) paused. '' Your directions shall be attended to, sir,'' said Miss Temple. '' And, ma'am,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week:
<p/>Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion.
<p/>it is too much; the rules limit them to one.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I think I can explain that circumstance, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brocklehurst/Brocklehurst</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brocklehurst nodded.
<p/>And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight.
<p/>'' Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur too often. How is this? I looked over the regulations, and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.
<p/>Who introduced this innovation? and by what authority?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Temple: '' ``Madam, allow me an instant.
<p/>You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.
<p/>Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.
<p/>A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) disciples to take up their cross and follow Him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>); to His (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) divine consolations, <div class="bookquote">``If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye.
<p/>when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!
<p/>Miss Temple had looked down when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) first began to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) now gazed straight before her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) face, naturally pale as marble, appeared to be assuming also the coldness and fixity of that material; especially her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) mouth, closed as if it would have required a sculptor's chisel to open it, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) brow settled gradually into petrified severity.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>Oh, madam, '' Mr. Brocklehurst again paused--perhaps overcome by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) feelings. Meantime, Mr. Brocklehurst, standing on the hearth with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) hands behind his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) back, majestically surveyed the whole school.
<p/>Suddenly his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) eye gave a blink, as if it had met something that either dazzled or shocked its pupil; turning, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) said in more rapid accents than he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) had hitherto used-- <div class="bookquote">``Miss Temple, Miss Temple,
<p/>what-- what is that girl with curled hair? Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And extending his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) cane he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) pointed to the awful object, his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) hand shaking as he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) did so.
<p/>'' It is Julia Severn,'' replied Miss Temple, very quietly. '' Julia Severn, ma'am! And why has she (<font color='blue'><b>Severn</b></font>), or any other, curled hair?
<p/>Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she (<font color='blue'><b>Severn</b></font>) conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable establishment--as to wear her (<font color='blue'><b>Severn</b></font>) hair one mass of curls?''
<p/>Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Julia's hair curls naturally,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>returned Miss Temple, still more quietly. '' Naturally! I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly.
<p/>Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence--that tall girl, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to turn round.
<p/>Miss Temple passed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) handkerchief over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lips, as if to smooth away the involuntary smile that curled them; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gave the order, however, and when the first class could take in what was required of them, they obeyed.
<p/>Leaning a little back on my bench, I could see the looks and grimaces with which they commented on this manoeuvre: it was a pity Mr. Brocklehurst could not see them too; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) would perhaps have felt that, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) might do with the outside of the cup and platter, the inside was further beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) interference than he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) imagined.
<p/>Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) scrutinised the reverse of these living medals some five minutes, then pronounced sentence.
<p/>These words fell like the knell of doom-- <div class="bookquote">``All those top-knots must be cut off. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Miss Temple seemed to remonstrate.
<p/>Madam,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the time wasted, of--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brocklehurst was here interrupted: three other visitors, ladies, now entered the room.
<p/>They ought to have come a little sooner to have heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) lecture on dress, for they were splendidly attired in velvet, silk, and furs.
<p/>The two younger of the trio -LRB-fine girls of sixteen and seventeen-RRB- had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wore a false front of French curls.
<p/>These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room.
<p/>It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he (<font color='blue'><b>reverend</b></font>) transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent.
<p/>They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted my attention.
<p/>Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation.
<p/>To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst.
<p/>'' It came. '' A careless girl!'' said Mr. Brocklehurst, and immediately after--<div class="bookquote">``It is the new pupil, I perceive. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brocklehurst/Brocklehurst</b></font>)</div>And before I could draw breath, <div class="bookquote">``I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Of my own accord I could not have stirred; I was paralysed: but the two great girls who sit on each side of me, set me on my legs and pushed me towards the dread judge, and then Miss Temple gently assisted me to his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) very feet, and I caught her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) whispered counsel--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then aloud: how loud it seemed to me! <div class="bookquote">``Let the child who broke her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) slate come forward! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be punished.
<p/>Another minute, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will despise me for a hypocrite,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>thought I; and an impulse of fury against Reed, Brocklehurst, and Co. bounded in my pulses at the conviction.
<p/>Fetch that stool,'' said Mr. Brocklehurst, pointing to a very high one from which a monitor had just risen: it was brought.
<p/>'' The kind whisper went to my heart like a dagger. '' I was no Helen Burns. '' <div class="bookquote">``Place the child upon it.
<p/>I was in no condition to note particulars; I was only aware that they had hoisted me up to the height of Mr. Brocklehurst's nose, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) was within a yard of me, and that a spread of shot orange and purple silk pelisses and a cloud of silvery plumage extended and waved below me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I was placed there, by whom I don't know: Mr. Brocklehurst hemmed. '' Ladies,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>), turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) family, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this girl?
<p/>You see she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is yet young; you observe she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) possesses the ordinary form of childhood; God has graciously given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) the shape that He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has given to all of us; no signal deformity points her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out as a marked character.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>Of course they did; for I felt their eyes directed like burning-glasses against my scorched skin. '' Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)?
<p/>A pause--in which I began to steady the palsy of my nerves, and to feel that the Rubicon was passed; and that the trial, no longer to be shirked, must be firmly sustained.
<p/>My dear children,'' pursued the black marble clergyman, with pathos, <div class="bookquote">``this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien.
<p/>You must be on your guard against her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); you must shun her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) example; if necessary, avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) company, exclude her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from your sports, and shut her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) out from your converse.
<p/>Teachers, you must watch her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): keep your eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) movements, weigh well her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) words, scrutinise her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) actions, punish her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) body to save her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible, for -LRB-my tongue falters while I tell it-RRB- this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the marble clergyman</b></font>)</div><p/>Now came a pause of ten minutes, during which I, by this time in perfect possession of my wits, observed all the female Brocklehursts produce their pocket-handkerchiefs and apply them to their optics, while the elderly lady swayed herself to and fro, and the two younger ones whispered, <div class="bookquote">``How shocking!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the ones</b></font>)</div><p/>This I learned from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) orphan state, reared her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) excellent patroness was obliged to separate her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own young ones, fearful lest her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) vicious example should contaminate their purity: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has sent her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>With this sublime conclusion, Mr. Brocklehurst adjusted the top button of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) surtout, muttered something to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) family, who rose, bowed to Miss Temple, and then all the great people sailed in state from the room.
<p/>Turning at the door, my judge said-- <div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) during the remainder of the day.
<p/>There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy.
<p/>What my sensations were no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case. ''  (<font color='red'><b>judge</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Brocklehurst resumed. '' '' '' What a strange light inspired them!
<p/>What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit.
<p/>Helen Burns asked some slight question about her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) place, and smiled at me as she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) again went by.
<p/>I remember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) marked lineaments, her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) thin face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an angel.
<p/>Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) arm <div class="bookquote">``the untidy badge;''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen/Helen Burns/Burns</b></font>)</div>scarcely an hour ago I had heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) had blotted an exercise in copying it out.
<p/>I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. What a smile! Such is the imperfect nature of man!
<p/>such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.
<p/>CHAPTER VIII Ere the half-hour ended, five o'clock struck; school was dismissed, and all were gone into the refectory to tea.
<p/>The spell by which I had been so far supported began to dissolve; reaction took place, and soon, so overwhelming was the grief that seized me
<p/>I now ventured to descend: it was deep dusk; I retired into a corner and sat down on the floor. , I sank prostrate with my face to the ground.
<p/>Now I wept: Helen Burns was not here; nothing sustained me; left to myself I abandoned myself, and my tears watered the boards.
<p/>I had meant to be so good, and to do so much at Lowood: to make so many friends, to earn respect and win affection.
<p/>Already I had made visible progress: that very morning I had reached the head of my class; Miss Miller had praised me warmly; Miss Temple had smiled approbation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Miller</b></font>) had promised to teach me drawing, and to let me learn French, if I continued to make similar improvement two months longer: and then I was well received by my fellow-pupils; treated as an equal by those of my own age, and not molested by any; now, here I lay again crushed and trodden on; and could I ever rise more?
<p/>While sobbing out this wish in broken accents, some one approached: I started up--again Helen Burns was near me; the fading fires just showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) coming up the long, vacant room; she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) brought my coffee and bread.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, eat something,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) said; but I put both away from me, feeling as if a drop or a crumb would have choked me in my present condition.
<p/>Helen regarded me, probably with surprise: I could not now abate my agitation, though I tried hard; I continued to weep aloud.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sat down on the ground near me, embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) knees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) arms, and rested her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) head upon them; in that attitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) remained silent as an Indian.
<p/>'' Never,'' I thought; and ardently I wished to die. I was the first who spoke-- <div class="bookquote">``Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Everybody, Jane? Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div><p/>Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.
<p/>'' But what have I to do with millions? The eighty, I know, despise me.'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Brocklehurst/Brocklehurst</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) even a great and admired man: he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) is little liked here; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) never took steps to make himself liked.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared.
<p/>Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression.
<p/>'' Besides, Jane''--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) paused. '' Well, Helen?'' said I, putting my hand into hers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) chafed my fingers gently to warm them, and went on--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if others don't love me I would rather die than live--
<p/>Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--
<p/>you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you.
<p/>Besides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence -LRB-if innocent we be:
<p/>as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front-RRB-, and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.
<p/>Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?
<p/>'' I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen. '' <div class="bookquote">``Hush, Jane! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was silent; Helen had calmed me; but in the tranquillity she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) imparted there was an alloy of inexpressible sadness.
<p/>I felt the impression of woe as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) spoke, but I could not tell whence it came; and when, having done speaking, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) breathed a little fast and coughed a short cough, I momentarily forgot my own sorrows to yield to a vague concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>).
<p/>Resting my head on Helen's shoulder, I put my arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) waist; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) drew me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), and we reposed in silence.
<p/>Some heavy clouds, swept from the sky by a rising wind, had left the moon bare; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) light, streaming in through a window near, shone full both on us and on the approaching figure, which we at once recognised as Miss Temple.
<p/>I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I want you in my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) may come too.
<p/>We went; following the superintendent's guidance, we had to thread some intricate passages, and mount a staircase before we reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) apartment; it contained a good fire, and looked cheerful.
<p/>Miss Temple told Helen Burns to be seated in a low arm-chair on one side of the hearth, and herself taking another, she (<font color='blue'><b>Temple</b></font>) called me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Temple</b></font>) side.
<p/>We had not sat long thus, when another person came in. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' Is it all over? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Temple</b></font>) asked, looking down at my face.
<p/>'' Have you cried your grief away?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid I never shall do that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else, will now think me wicked.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child. Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Shall I, Miss Temple?'' <div class="bookquote">``You will,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), passing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arm round me. '' And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?''
<p/>'' Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife. My uncle is dead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) left me to her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) care.'' '' Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) not, then, adopt you of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) own accord?''
<p/>; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often heard the servants say, got her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) to promise before he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) died that she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) would always keep me.
<p/>Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a criminal is accused, he (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) is always allowed to speak in his (<font color='blue'><b>criminal</b></font>) own defence.
<p/>'' No, ma'am '' '' You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as you can. Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing.
<p/>I resolved, in the depth of my heart, that I would be most moderate--most correct; and, having reflected a few minutes in order to arrange coherently what I had to say, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) all the story of my sad childhood.
<p/>Exhausted by emotion, my language was more subdued than it generally was when it developed that sad theme; and mindful of Helen's warnings against the indulgence of resentment, I infused into the narrative far less of gall and wormwood than ordinary.
<p/>'' Thus restrained and simplified, it sounded more credible: I felt as I went on that Miss Temple fully believed me.
<p/>In the course of the tale I had mentioned Mr. Lloyd as having come to see me after the fit: for I never forgot the, to me, frightful episode of the red-room:
<p/>in detailing which, my excitement was sure, in some degree, to break bounds; for nothing could soften in my recollection the spasm of agony which clutched my heart when Mrs. Reed spurned my wild supplication for pardon, and locked me a second time in the dark and haunted chamber.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>); if his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) reply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) kissed me, and still keeping me at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) side -LRB-where I was well contented to stand, for I derived a child's pleasure from the contemplation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) one or two ornaments, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) white forehead, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) clustered and shining curls, and beaming dark eyes-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) proceeded to address Helen Burns.
<p/>I had finished: Miss Temple regarded me a few minutes in silence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) then said-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>Helen/Helen Burns/Burns</b></font>)</div>'' How are you to-night, Helen?
<p/>Have you coughed much to-day?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not quite so much, I think, ma'am.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And the pain in your chest?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is a little better.
<p/>Miss Temple got up, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) hand and examined her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) pulse; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) own seat: as she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) resumed it, I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sigh low.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was pensive a few minutes, then rousing herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) said cheerfully-- <div class="bookquote">``But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.
<p/>Barbara,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) said to the servant who answered it, <div class="bookquote">``I have not yet had tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.
<p/>How pretty, to my eyes, did the china cups and bright teapot look, placed on the little round table near the fire!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the servant</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) rang her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) bell. '' '' And a tray was soon brought. How fragrant was the steam of the beverage, and the scent of the toast!
<p/>of which, however, I, to my dismay -LRB-for I was beginning to be hungry-RRB- discerned only a very small portion: Miss Temple discerned it too.
<p/>'' Barbara ,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``can you not bring a little more bread and butter? There is not enough for three.
<p/>Mrs. Harden, be it observed, was the housekeeper: a woman after Mr. Brocklehurst's own heart, made up of equal parts of whalebone and iron.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Barbara went out: she (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) returned soon-- <div class="bookquote">``Madam, Mrs. Harden says she (<font color='blue'><b>Harden</b></font>) has sent up the usual quantity. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, very well!
<p/>And as the girl withdrew she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) added, smiling, <div class="bookquote">``Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.
<p/>Having invited Helen and me to approach the table, and placed before each of us a cup of tea with one delicious but thin morsel of toast, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) got up, unlocked a drawer, and taking from it a parcel wrapped in paper, disclosed presently to our eyes a good-sized seed-cake.
<p/>I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) proceeded to cut slices with a generous hand.
<p/>We feasted that evening as on nectar and ambrosia; and not the least delight of the entertainment was the smile of gratification with which our hostess regarded us, as we satisfied our famished appetites on the delicate fare she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) liberally supplied.
<p/>Tea over and the tray removed, she (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) again summoned us to the fire; we sat one on each side of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>), and now a conversation followed between her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>) and Helen, which it was indeed a privilege to be admitted to hear.
<p/>Miss Temple had always something of serenity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) air, of state in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) mien, of refined propriety in her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) language, which precluded deviation into the ardent, the excited, the eager: something which chastened the pleasure of those who looked on her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) and listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), by a controlling sense of awe; and such was my feeling now: but as to Helen Burns, I was struck with wonder.
<p/>The refreshing meal, the brilliant fire, the presence and kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) beloved instructress, or, perhaps, more than all these, something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) own unique mind, had roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) powers within her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>).
<p/>They woke, they kindled: first, they glowed in the bright tint of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) cheek, which till this hour I had never seen but pale and bloodless; then they shone in the liquid lustre of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) eyes, which had suddenly acquired a beauty more singular than that of Miss Temple's--a beauty neither of fine colour nor long eyelash, nor pencilled brow, but of meaning, of movement, of radiance.
<p/>'' returned Miss Temple; <div class="bookquote">``we must make it do, Barbara, I suppose. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' Then her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) soul sat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Barbara</b></font>) lips, and language flowed, from what source I cannot tell.
<p/>Has a girl of fourteen a heart large enough, vigorous enough, to hold the swelling spring of pure, full, fervid eloquence?
<p/>Such was the characteristic of Helen's discourse on that, to me, memorable evening; her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) spirit seemed hastening to live within a very brief span as much as many live during a protracted existence.
<p/>They conversed of things I had never heard of; of nations and times past; of countries far away; of secrets of nature discovered or guessed at: they spoke of books: how many they had read!
<p/>Then they seemed so familiar with French names and French authors: but my amazement reached its climax when Miss Temple asked Helen if she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sometimes snatched a moment to recall the Latin her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) father had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), and taking a book from a shelf, bade her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) read and construe a page of Virgil; and Helen obeyed, my organ of veneration expanding at every sounding line.
<p/>no delay could be admitted; Miss Temple embraced us both, saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Temple</b></font>) drew us to her (<font color='blue'><b>Temple</b></font>) heart-- <div class="bookquote">``God bless you, my children!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>What stores of knowledge they possessed! She (<font color='blue'><b>Temple</b></font>) had scarcely finished ere the bell announced bedtime! Helen she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) held a little longer than me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) let her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) go more reluctantly; it was Helen
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) eye followed to the door; it was for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) a second time breathed a sad sigh; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) wiped a tear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) cheek.
<p/>On reaching the bedroom, we heard the voice of Miss Scatcherd: she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) was examining drawers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Scatcherd</b></font>) had just pulled out Helen Burns's, and when we entered Helen was greeted with a sharp reprimand, and told that to-morrow she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) should have half-a-dozen of untidily folded articles pinned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) shoulder.
<p/>My things were indeed in shameful disorder,'' murmured Helen to me, in a low voice: ``I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.
<p/>Next morning, Miss Scatcherd wrote in conspicuous characters on a piece of pasteboard the word <div class="bookquote">``Slattern,''  (<font color='red'><b>characters</b></font>)</div>and bound it like a phylactery round Helen's large, mild, intelligent, and benign-looking forehead.
<p/>The moment Miss Scatcherd withdrew after afternoon school, I ran to Helen, tore it off, and thrust it into the fire: the fury of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was incapable had been burning in my soul all day, and tears, hot and large, had continually been scalding my cheek; for the spectacle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) sad resignation gave me an intolerable pain at the heart.
<p/>About a week subsequently to the incidents above narrated, Miss Temple, who had written to Mr. Lloyd, received his (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) answer: it appeared that what he (<font color='blue'><b>Lloyd</b></font>) said went to corroborate my account.
<p/>Miss Temple, having assembled the whole school, announced that inquiry had been made into the charges alleged against Jane Eyre, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) was most happy to be able to pronounce her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) completely cleared from every imputation.
<p/>The teachers then shook hands with me and kissed me, and a murmur of pleasure ran through the ranks of my companions.
<p/>Thus relieved of a grievous load, I from that hour set to work afresh, resolved to pioneer my way through every difficulty:
<p/>I toiled hard, and my success was proportionate to my efforts; my memory, not naturally tenacious, improved with practice; exercise sharpened my wits; in a few weeks I was promoted to a higher class; in less than two months I was allowed to commence French and drawing.
<p/>I learned the first two tenses of the verb Etre , and sketched my first cottage -LRB-whose walls, by-the- bye, outrivalled in slope those of the leaning tower of Pisa-RRB-, on the same day.
<p/>That night, on going to bed, I forgot to prepare in imagination the Barmecide supper of hot roast potatoes, or white bread and new milk, with which I was wont to amuse my inward cravings: I feasted instead on the spectacle of ideal drawings, which I saw in the dark; all the work of my own hands: freely pencilled houses and trees, picturesque rocks and ruins, Cuyp-like groups of cattle, sweet paintings of butterflies hovering over unblown roses, of birds picking at ripe cherries, of wren's nests enclosing pearl-like eggs, wreathed about with young ivy sprays.
<p/>I examined, too, in thought, the possibility of my ever being able to translate currently a certain little French story which Madame Pierrot had that day shown me; nor was that problem solved to my satisfaction
<p/>'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Pierrot</b></font>) wore it till evening, patient, unresentful, regarding it as a deserved punishment. ere I fell sweetly asleep. Well has Solomon said--<div class="bookquote">``Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Solomon</b></font>)</div>I would not now have exchanged Lowood with all its privations for Gateshead and its daily luxuries. CHAPTER IX But the privations, or rather the hardships, of Lowood lessened.
<p/>Spring drew on: she (<font color='blue'><b>Pierrot</b></font>) was indeed already come; the frosts of winter had ceased; its snows were melted, its cutting winds ameliorated.
<p/>My wretched feet, flayed and swollen to lameness by the sharp air of January, began to heal and subside under the gentler breathings of April; the nights and mornings no longer by their Canadian temperature froze the very blood in our veins; we could now endure the play-hour passed in the garden: sometimes on a sunny day it began even to be pleasant and genial, and a greenness grew over those brown beds, which, freshening daily, suggested the thought that Hope traversed them at night, and left each morning brighter traces of her (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) steps.
<p/>Flowers peeped out amongst the leaves; snow-drops, crocuses, purple auriculas, and golden-eyed pansies. On Thursday afternoons -LRB-half-holidays-RRB- we now took walks, and found still sweeter flowers opening by the wayside, under the hedges.
<p/>I discovered, too, that a great pleasure, an enjoyment which the horizon only bounded, lay all outside the high and spike-guarded walls of our garden: this pleasure consisted in prospect of noble summits girdling a great hill-hollow, rich in verdure and shadow; in a bright beck, full of dark stones and sparkling eddies.
<p/>How different had this scene looked when I viewed it laid out beneath the iron sky of winter, stiffened in frost, shrouded with snow!--when mists as chill as death wandered to the impulse of east winds along those purple peaks, and rolled down <div class="bookquote">``ing''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and holm till they blended with the frozen fog of the beck!
<p/>That beck itself was then a torrent, turbid and curbless: it tore asunder the wood, and sent a raving sound through the air, often thickened with wild rain or whirling sleet; and for the forest on its banks, that showed only ranks of skeletons.
<p/>April advanced to May: a bright serene May it was; days of blue sky, placid sunshine, and soft western or southern gales filled up its duration.
<p/>And now vegetation matured with vigour; Lowood shook loose its tresses; it became all green, all flowery; its great elm, ash, and oak skeletons were restored to majestic life; woodland plants sprang up profusely in its recesses; unnumbered varieties of moss filled its hollows, and it made a strange ground-sunshine out of the wealth of its wild primrose plants: I have seen their pale gold gleam in overshadowed spots like scatterings of the sweetest lustre.
<p/>All this I enjoyed often and fully, free, unwatched, and almost alone: for this unwonted liberty and pleasure there was a cause, to which it now becomes my task to advert.
<p/>Have I not described a pleasant site for a dwelling, when I speak of it as bosomed in hill and wood, and rising from the verge of a stream?
<p/>That forest-dell, where Lowood lay, was the cradle of fog and fog-bred pestilence; which, quickening with the quickening spring, crept into the Orphan Asylum, breathed typhus through its crowded schoolroom and dormitory, and, ere May arrived, transformed the seminary into an hospital.
<p/>Semi-starvation and neglected colds had predisposed most of the pupils to receive infection: forty-five out of the eighty girls lay ill at one time.
<p/>The few who continued well were allowed almost unlimited license; because the medical attendant insisted on the necessity of frequent exercise to keep them in health: and had it been otherwise, no one had leisure to watch or restrain them.
<p/>Miss Temple's whole attention was absorbed by the patients: she (<font color='blue'><b>girls</b></font>) lived in the sick-room, never quitting it except to snatch a few hours' rest at night.
<p/>The teachers were fully occupied with packing up and making other necessary preparations for the departure of those girls who were fortunate enough to have friends and relations able and willing to remove them from the seat of contagion.
<p/>Many, already smitten, went home only to die: some died at the school, and were buried quietly and quickly, the nature of the malady forbidding delay.
<p/>While disease had thus become an inhabitant of Lowood, and death its frequent visitor; while there was gloom and fear within its walls; while its rooms and passages steamed with hospital smells, the drug and the pastille striving vainly to overcome the effluvia of mortality, that bright May shone unclouded over the bold hills and beautiful woodland out of doors.
<p/>Its garden, too, glowed with flowers: hollyhocks had sprung up tall as trees, lilies had opened, tulips and roses were in bloom; the borders of the little beds were gay with pink thrift and crimson double daisies; the sweetbriars gave out, morning and evening, their scent of spice and apples; and these fragrant treasures were all useless for most of the inmates of Lowood, except to furnish now and then a handful of herbs and blossoms to put in a coffin.
<p/>But I, and the rest who continued well, enjoyed fully the beauties of the scene and season; they let us ramble in the wood, like gipsies, from morning till night; we did what we liked, went where we liked: we lived better too.
<p/>Mr. Brocklehurst and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) family never came near Lowood now: household matters were not scrutinised into; the cross housekeeper was gone, driven away by the fear of infection; her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) successor, who had been matron at the Lowton Dispensary, unused to the ways of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) new abode, provided with comparative liberality.
<p/>Besides, there were fewer to feed; the sick could eat little; our breakfast-basins were better filled; when there was no time to prepare a regular dinner, which often happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) would give us a large piece of cold pie, or a thick slice of bread and cheese, and this we carried away with us to the wood, where we each chose the spot we liked best, and dined sumptuously.
<p/>My favourite seat was a smooth and broad stone, rising white and dry from the very middle of the beck, and only to be got at by wading through the water; a feat I accomplished barefoot.
<p/>The stone was just broad enough to accommodate, comfortably, another girl and me, at that time my chosen comrade--one Mary Ann Wilson; a shrewd, observant personage, whose society I took pleasure in, partly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) was witty and original, and partly because she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) had a manner which set me at my ease.
<p/>Some years older than I, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) knew more of the world, and could tell me many things I liked to hear:
<p/>with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) my curiosity found gratification: to my faults also she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) gave ample indulgence, never imposing curb or rein on anything I said.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) had a turn for narrative, I for analysis; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) liked to inform, I to question; so we got on swimmingly together, deriving much entertainment, if not much improvement, from our mutual intercourse.
<p/>Assuredly, pleasant enough: but whether healthy or not is another question. Classes were broken up, rules relaxed. And where, meantime, was Helen Burns?
<p/>Why did I not spend these sweet days of liberty with her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>)? Had I forgotten her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>)? or was I so worthless as to have grown tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) pure society?
<p/>Surely the Mary Ann Wilson I have mentioned was inferior to my first acquaintance: she (<font color='blue'><b>Wilson</b></font>) could only tell me amusing stories, and reciprocate any racy and pungent gossip I chose to indulge in; while, if I have spoken truth of Helen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was qualified to give those who enjoyed the privilege of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) converse a taste of far higher things.
<p/>True, reader; and I knew and felt this: and though I am a defective being, with many faults and few redeeming points, yet I never tired of Helen Burns; nor ever ceased to cherish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) a sentiment of attachment, as strong, tender, and respectful as any that ever animated my heart.
<p/>How could it be otherwise, when Helen, at all times and under all circumstances, evinced for me a quiet and faithful friendship, which ill-humour never soured, nor irritation never troubled?
<p/>But Helen was ill at present: for some weeks she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) had been removed from my sight to I knew not what room upstairs.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was not, I was told, in the hospital portion of the house with the fever patients; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) complaint was consumption, not typhus: and by consumption I, in my ignorance, understood something mild, which time and care would be sure to alleviate.
<p/>I was confirmed in this idea by the fact of her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) once or twice coming downstairs on very warm sunny afternoons, and being taken by Miss Temple into the garden; but, on these occasions, I was not allowed to go and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>); I only saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) from the schoolroom window, and then not distinctly; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) was much wrapped up, and sat at a distance under the verandah.
<p/>One evening, in the beginning of June, I had stayed out very late with Mary Ann in the wood; we had, as usual, separated ourselves from the others, and had wandered far; so far that we lost our way, and had to ask it at a lonely cottage, where a man and woman lived, who looked after a herd of half-wild swine that fed on the mast in the wood.
<p/>When we got back, it was after moonrise: a pony, which we knew to be the surgeon's, was standing at the garden door.
<p/>Mary Ann remarked that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) supposed some one must be very ill, as Mr. Bates had been sent for at that time of the evening.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) went into the house; I stayed behind a few minutes to plant in my garden a handful of roots I had dug up in the forest, and which I feared would wither if I left them till the morning.
<p/>This done, I lingered yet a little longer: the flowers smelt so sweet as the dew fell; it was such a pleasant evening, so serene, so warm; the still glowing west promised so fairly another fine day on the morrow; the moon rose with such majesty in the grave east.
<p/>I was noting these things and enjoying them as a child might, when it entered my mind as it had never done before:-- <div class="bookquote">``How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying!
<p/>This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to have to go who knows where? ''
 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><p/>And then my mind made its first earnest effort to comprehend what had been infused into it concerning heaven and hell; and for the first time it recoiled, baffled; and for the first time glancing behind, on each side, and before it, it saw all round an unfathomed gulf: it felt the one point where it stood--the present; all the rest was formless cloud and vacant depth; and it shuddered at the thought of tottering, and plunging amid that chaos.
<p/>While pondering this new idea, I heard the front door open; Mr. Bates came out, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was a nurse.
<p/>After she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) mount his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) horse and depart, she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was about to close the door, but I ran up to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).
<p/>'' How is Helen Burns?'' <div class="bookquote">``Very poorly,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer. '' Is it her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) Mr. Bates has been to see?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>This phrase, uttered in my hearing yesterday, would have only conveyed the notion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) was about to be removed to Northumberland, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) own home.
<p/>'' And what does he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) say about her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>)?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>)'ll not be here long. '' I should not have suspected that it meant she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) was dying; but I knew instantly now!
<p/>It opened clear on my comprehension that Helen Burns was numbering her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) last days in this world, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) was going to be taken to the region of spirits, if such region there were.
<p/>I experienced a shock of horror, then a strong thrill of grief, then a desire--a necessity to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>); and I asked in what room she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) lay.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) is in Miss Temple's room,'' said the nurse. '' May I go up and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)?'' '' Oh no, child!
<p/>It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in; you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.
<p/>'' The nurse closed the front door; I went in by the side entrance which led to the schoolroom: I was just in time; it was nine o'clock, and Miss Miller was calling the pupils to go to bed.
<p/>It might be two hours later, probably near eleven, when I--not having been able to fall asleep, and deeming, from the perfect silence of the dormitory, that my companions were all wrapt in profound repose--rose softly, put on my frock over my night-dress, and, without shoes, crept from the apartment, and set off in quest of Miss Temple's room.
<p/>It was quite at the other end of the house; but I knew my way; and the light of the unclouded summer moon, entering here and there at passage windows, enabled me to find it without difficulty.
<p/>An odour of camphor and burnt vinegar warned me when I came near the fever room: and I passed its door quickly, fearful lest the nurse who sat up all night should hear me.
<p/>I dreaded being discovered and sent back; for I must see Helen,--I must embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) before she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) died,--I must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) one last kiss, exchange with her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) one last word.
<p/>Having descended a staircase, traversed a portion of the house below, and succeeded in opening and shutting, without noise, two doors, I reached another flight of steps; these I mounted, and then just opposite to me was Miss Temple's room.
<p/>A light shone through the keyhole and from under the door; a profound stillness pervaded the vicinity. Coming near, I found the door slightly ajar; probably to admit some fresh air into the close abode of sickness.
<p/>Indisposed to hesitate, and full of impatient impulses--soul and senses quivering with keen throes--I put it back and looked in. My eye sought Helen, and feared to find death.
<p/>I saw the outline of a form under the clothes, but the face was hid by the hangings: the nurse I had spoken to in the garden sat in an easy-chair asleep; an unsnuffed candle burnt dimly on the table.
<p/>Miss Temple was not to be seen: I knew afterwards that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had been called to a delirious patient in the fever-room.
<p/>I advanced; then paused by the crib side: my hand was on the curtain, but I preferred speaking before I withdrew it.
<p/>Close by Miss Temple's bed, and half covered with its white curtains, there stood a little crib. I still recoiled at the dread of seeing a corpse.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) stirred herself, put back the curtain, and I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) face, pale, wasted, but quite composed: she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) looked so little changed that my fear was instantly dissipated.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Helen! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I whispered softly, <div class="bookquote">``are you awake? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Can it be you, Jane? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) asked, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own gentle voice.
<p/>I thought, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is not going to die; they are mistaken: she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not speak and look so calmly if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) were.
<p/>I got on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) crib and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>): her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) forehead was cold, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cheek both cold and thin, and so were her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hand and wrist; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) smiled as of old.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Oh!'' '' '' Why are you come here, Jane? It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it strike some minutes since.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Are you going somewhere, Helen? Are you going home?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>While I tried to devour my tears, a fit of coughing seized Helen; it did not, however, wake the nurse; when it was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) lay some minutes exhausted; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) whispered--
<p/>'' Yes; to my long home--my last home.'' <div class="bookquote">``No, no, Helen!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I stopped, distressed. <div class="bookquote">``Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did so: she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) arm over me, and I nestled close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). After a long silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) resumed, still whispering--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.
<p/>We all must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.
<p/>I leave no one to regret me much: I have only a father; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is lately married, and will not miss me.
<p/>I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have been continually at fault.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings. '' But where are you going to, Helen? Can you see? Do you know?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where is God? What is God?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) created.
<p/>I rely implicitly on His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) power, and confide wholly in His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) goodness: I count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), reveal Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Helen/Helen Burns/Burns</b></font>)</div><p/>You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and that our souls can get to it when we die?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign my immortal part to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) without any misgiving.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>God is my father; God is my friend: I love Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); I believe He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) loves me.'' '' And shall I see you again,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.
<p/>Helen, when I die?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Again I questioned, but this time only in thought. '' Where is that region? Does it exist?
<p/>And I clasped my arms closer round Helen; she (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) seemed dearer to me than ever; I felt as if I could not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) go; I lay with my face hidden on her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) neck.
<p/>That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you near me.''
<p/>'' Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said, in the sweetest tone-- ``How comfortable I am! <div class="bookquote">``I'll stay with you, dear Helen: no one shall take me away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you warm, darling?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Jane.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Helen. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>) kissed me, and I her (<font color='blue'><b>Helen</b></font>), and we both soon slumbered.
<p/>When I awoke it was day: an unusual movement roused me; I looked up; I was in somebody's arms; the nurse held me; she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) was carrying me through the passage back to the dormitory.
<p/>I was not reprimanded for leaving my bed; people had something else to think about; no explanation was afforded then to my many questions; but a day or two afterwards I learned that Miss Temple, on returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) own room at dawn, had found me laid in the little crib; my face against Helen Burns's shoulder, my arms round her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) neck.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) grave is in Brocklebridge churchyard: for fifteen years after her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) death it was only covered by a grassy mound; but now a grey marble tablet marks the spot, inscribed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) name, and the word <div class="bookquote">``Resurgam.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>CHAPTER X Hitherto I have recorded in detail the events of my insignificant existence: to the first ten years of my life I have given almost as many chapters.
<p/>I am only bound to invoke Memory where I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) responses will possess some degree of interest; therefore I now pass a space of eight years almost in silence: a few lines only are necessary to keep up the links of connection.
<p/>When the typhus fever had fulfilled its mission of devastation at Lowood, it gradually disappeared from thence; but not till its virulence and the number of its victims had drawn public attention on the school.
<p/>Inquiry was made into the origin of the scourge, and by degrees various facts came out which excited public indignation in a high degree.
<p/>The unhealthy nature of the site; the quantity and quality of the children's food; the brackish, fetid water used in its preparation; the pupils' wretched clothing and accommodations--all these things were discovered, and the discovery produced a result mortifying to Mr. Brocklehurst, but beneficial to the institution.
<p/>Several wealthy and benevolent individuals in the county subscribed largely for the erection of a more convenient building in a better situation; new regulations were made; improvements in diet and clothing introduced; the funds of the school were intrusted to the management of a committee.
<p/>Mr. Brocklehurst, who, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) wealth and family connections, could not be overlooked, still retained the post of treasurer; but he (<font color='blue'><b>treasurer</b></font>) was aided in the discharge of his (<font color='blue'><b>treasurer</b></font>) duties by gentlemen of rather more enlarged and sympathising minds: his (<font color='blue'><b>treasurer</b></font>) office of inspector, too, was shared by those who knew how to combine reason with strictness, comfort with economy, compassion with uprightness.
<p/>I was asleep, and Helen was--dead. But this is not to be a regular autobiography. The school, thus improved, became in time a truly useful and noble institution.
<p/>I remained an inmate of its walls, after its regeneration, for eight years: six as pupil, and two as teacher; and in both capacities I bear my testimony to its value and importance.
<p/>I had the means of an excellent education placed within my reach; a fondness for some of my studies, and a desire to excel in all, together with a great delight in pleasing my teachers, especially such as I loved, urged me on: I availed myself fully of the advantages offered me.
<p/>In time I rose to be the first girl of the first class; then I was invested with the office of teacher; which I discharged with zeal for two years: but at the end of that time I altered.
<p/>Miss Temple, through all changes, had thus far continued superintendent of the seminary: to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) instruction I owed the best part of my acquirements; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friendship and society had been my continual solace; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had stood me in the stead of mother, governess, and, latterly, companion.
<p/>At this period she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) married, removed with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) husband -LRB-a clergyman, an excellent man, almost worthy of such a wife-RRB- to a distant county, and consequently was lost to me.
<p/>From the day she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) left I was no longer the same: with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was gone every settled feeling, every association that had made Lowood in some degree a home to me.
<p/>I had imbibed from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) something of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nature and much of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) habits: more harmonious thoughts: what seemed better regulated feelings had become the inmates of my mind.
<p/>During these eight years my life was uniform: but not unhappy, because it was not inactive. I had given in allegiance to duty and order
<p/>; I was quiet; I believed I was content: to the eyes of others, usually even to my own , I appeared a disciplined and subdued character.
<p/>But destiny, in the shape of the Rev. Mr. Nasmyth, came between me and Miss Temple: I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) travelling dress step into a post-chaise, shortly after the marriage ceremony; I watched the chaise mount the hill and disappear beyond its brow; and then retired to my own room, and there spent in solitude the greatest part of the half-holiday granted in honour of the occasion.
<p/>I imagined myself only to be regretting my loss, and thinking how to repair it; but when my reflections were concluded, and I looked up and found that the afternoon was gone, and evening far advanced, another discovery dawned on me, namely, that in the interval I had undergone a transforming process; that my mind had put off all it had borrowed of Miss Temple--or rather that she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had taken with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the serene atmosphere I had been breathing in her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) vicinity--and that now I was left in my natural element, and beginning to feel the stirring of old emotions.
<p/>It did not seem as if a prop were withdrawn, but rather as if a motive were gone: it was not the power to be tranquil which had failed me, but the reason for tranquillity was no more.
<p/>My world had for some years been in Lowood: my experience had been of its rules and systems; now I remembered that the real world was wide, and that a varied field of hopes and fears, of sensations and excitements, awaited those who had courage to go forth into its expanse, to seek real knowledge of life amidst its perils.
<p/>There were the two wings of the building; there was the garden; there were the skirts of Lowood; there was the hilly horizon.
<p/>My eye passed all other objects to rest on those most remote, the blue peaks; it was those I longed to surmount; all within their boundary of rock and heath seemed prison-ground, exile limits.
<p/>I traced the white road winding round the base of one mountain, and vanishing in a gorge between two; how I longed to follow it farther!
<p/>I recalled the time when I had travelled that very road in a coach; I remembered descending that hill at twilight; an age seemed to have elapsed since the day which brought me first to Lowood, and I had never quitted it since.
<p/>My vacations had all been spent at school: Mrs. Reed had never sent for me to Gateshead; neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) nor any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) family had ever been to visit me.
<p/>I walked about the chamber most of the time. I went to my window, opened it, and looked out. I had had no communication by letter or message with the outer world:
<p/>school-rules, school-duties, school-habits and notions, and voices, and faces, and phrases, and costumes, and preferences, and antipathies --such was what I knew of existence.
<p/>I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind then faintly blowing.
<p/>And now I felt that it was not enough; I tired of the routine of eight years in one afternoon. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication; for change, stimulus: that petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried, half desperate, <div class="bookquote">``grant me at least a new servitude! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Here a bell, ringing the hour of supper, called me downstairs.
<p/>I was not free to resume the interrupted chain of my reflections till bedtime: even then a teacher who occupied the same room with me kept me from the subject to which I longed to recur, by a prolonged effusion of small talk.
<p/>It seemed as if, could I but go back to the idea which had last entered my mind as I stood at the window, some inventive suggestion would rise for my relief.
<p/>Miss Gryce snored at last; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gryce</b></font>) was a heavy Welshwoman, and till now her (<font color='blue'><b>Gryce</b></font>) habitual nasal strains had never been regarded by me in any other light than as a nuisance; to-night I hailed the first deep notes with satisfaction; I was debarrassed of interruption; my half-effaced thought instantly revived.
<p/>There is something in that,'' I soliloquised -LRB-mentally, be it understood; I did not talk aloud-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I know there is, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them.
<p/>How I wished sleep would silence her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A new servitude! But Servitude! That must be matter of fact. Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere.
<p/>Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.
<p/>I sat up in bed by way of arousing this said brain: it was a chilly night; I covered my shoulders with a shawl, and then I proceeded to think again with all my might.
<p/>Can I not get so much of my own will? Is not the thing feasible? '' '' What do I want?
<p/>A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better.
<p/>There are many others who have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is their resource?
<p/>How do people do to get a new place? They apply to friends, I suppose: I have no friends. '' I could not tell: nothing answered me; I then ordered my brain to find a response, and quickly.
<p/>It worked and worked faster: I felt the pulses throb in my head and temples; but for nearly an hour it worked in chaos; and no result came of its efforts.
<p/>Feverish with vain labour, I got up and took a turn in the room; undrew the curtain, noted a star or two, shivered with cold, and again crept to bed.
<p/>A kind fairy, in my absence, had surely dropped the required suggestion on my pillow; for as I lay down, it came quietly and naturally to my mind.--<div class="bookquote">``Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the --shire Herald .''
 (<font color='red'><b>the editor</b></font>)</div><p/>You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the Herald ; you must put it, the first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.
<p/>This scheme I went over twice, thrice; it was then digested in my mind; I had it in a clear practical form:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How? I know nothing about advertising. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Replies rose smooth and prompt now:-- '' '' I felt satisfied, and fell asleep.
<p/>With earliest day, I was up: I had my advertisement written, enclosed, and directed before the bell rang to rouse the school; it ran thus:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A young lady accustomed to tuition''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-had I not been a teacher two years?-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age-RRB-.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>teacher</b></font>) is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music '' -LRB-in those days, reader, this now narrow catalogue of accomplishments, would have been held tolerably comprehensive-RRB-.
<p/>This document remained locked in my drawer all day: after tea, I asked leave of the new superintendent to go to Lowton, in order to perform some small commissions for myself and one or two of my fellow-teachers; permission was readily granted; I went.
<p/>It was a walk of two miles, and the evening was wet, but the days were still long; I visited a shop or two, slipped the letter into the post-office, and came back through heavy rain, with streaming garments, but with a relieved heart.
<p/>The succeeding week seemed long: it came to an end at last, however, like all sublunary things, and once more, towards the close of a pleasant autumn day, I found myself afoot on the road to Lowton.
<p/>A picturesque track it was, by the way; lying along the side of the beck and through the sweetest curves of the dale: but that day I thought more of the letters, that might or might not be awaiting me at the little burgh whither I was bound, than of the charms of lea and water.
<p/>My ostensible errand on this occasion was to get measured for a pair of shoes; so I discharged that business first, and when it was done, I stepped across the clean and quiet little street from the shoemaker's to the post-office: it was kept by an old dame, who wore horn spectacles on her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) nose, and black mittens on her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hands.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) peered at me over her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) spectacles, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) opened a drawer and fumbled among its contents for a long time, so long that my hopes began to falter.
<p/>At last, having held a document before her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) glasses for nearly five minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) presented it across the counter, accompanying the act by another inquisitive and mistrustful glance--it was for J.E.
<p/>'' Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, -- shire. '' '' Are there any letters for J.E.? '' I asked. <div class="bookquote">``Is there only one?
<p/>There are no more,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>); and I put it in my pocket and turned my face homeward: I could not open it then; rules obliged me to be back by eight, and it was already half-past seven.
<p/>I had to sit with the girls during their hour of study; then it was my turn to read prayers; to see them to bed: afterwards I supped with the other teachers.
<p/>Even when we finally retired for the night, the inevitable Miss Gryce was still my companion: we had only a short end of candle in our candlestick, and I dreaded lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Gryce</b></font>) should talk till it was all burnt out; fortunately, however, the heavy supper she (<font color='blue'><b>Gryce</b></font>) had eaten produced a soporific effect: she (<font color='blue'><b>Gryce</b></font>) was already snoring before I had finished undressing.
<p/>There still remained an inch of candle: I now took out my letter; the seal was an initial F.; I broke it; the contents were brief.
<p/>If J.E., who advertised in the --shire Herald of last Thursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gryce</b></font>) is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Gryce</b></font>) where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.
<p/>'' I demanded. '' Various duties awaited me on my arrival. '' J.E. is requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the direction:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, --shire. ''  (<font color='red'><b>J.E.</b></font>)</div>I examined the document long: the writing was old-fashioned and rather uncertain, like that of an elderly lady.
<p/>This circumstance was satisfactory: a private fear had haunted me, that in thus acting for myself, and by my own guidance, I ran the risk of getting into some scrape; and, above all things, I wished the result of my endeavours to be respectable, proper, en regle .
<p/>I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in a black gown and widow's cap; frigid, perhaps, but not uncivil: a model of elderly English respectability.
<p/>I now felt that an elderly lady was no bad ingredient in the business I had on hand. Mrs. Fairfax! Thornfield!
<p/>that, doubtless, was the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house: a neat orderly spot , I was sure; though I failed in my efforts to conceive a correct plan of the premises.
<p/>Millcote, --shire ; I brushed up my recollections of the map of England, yes, I saw it; both the shire and the town.
<p/>I longed to go where there was life and movement: Millcote was a large manufacturing town on the banks of the A-; a busy place enough, doubtless: so much the better; it would be a complete change at least.
<p/>Not that my fancy was much captivated by the idea of long chimneys and clouds of smoke--<div class="bookquote">``but,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I argued, <div class="bookquote">``Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from the town.
<p/>--shire was seventy miles nearer London than the remote county where I now resided: that was a recommendation to me. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Next day new steps were to be taken; my plans could no longer be confined to my own breast; I must impart them in order to achieve their success.
<p/>Having sought and obtained an audience of the superintendent during the noontide recreation, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) I had a prospect of getting a new situation where the salary would be double what I now received -LRB-for at Lowood
<p/>I only got 15 pounds per annum-RRB-; and requested she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would break the matter for me to Mr. Brocklehurst, or some of the committee, and ascertain whether they would permit me to mention them as references.
<p/>Here the socket of the candle dropped, and the wick went out. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) obligingly consented to act as mediatrix in the matter.
<p/>The next day she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) laid the affair before Mr. Brocklehurst, who said that Mrs. Reed must be written to, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was my natural guardian.
<p/>A note was accordingly addressed to that lady, who returned for answer, that <div class="bookquote">``I might do as I pleased: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had long relinquished all interference in my affairs.
<p/>This note went the round of the committee, and at last, after what appeared to me most tedious delay, formal leave was given me to better my condition if I could; and an assurance added, that as I had always conducted myself well, both as teacher and pupil, at Lowood, a testimonial of character and capacity, signed by the inspectors of that institution, should forthwith be furnished me.
<p/>This testimonial I accordingly received in about a month, forwarded a copy of it to Mrs. Fairfax, and got that lady's reply, stating that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was satisfied, and fixing that day fortnight as the period for my assuming the post of governess in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) house.
<p/>I had not a very large wardrobe, though it was adequate to my wants; and the last day sufficed to pack my trunk,--the same I had brought with me eight years ago from Gateshead.
<p/>In half-an-hour the carrier was to call for it to take it to Lowton, whither I myself was to repair at an early hour the next morning to meet the coach.
<p/>I had brushed my black stuff travelling-dress, prepared my bonnet, gloves, and muff; sought in all my drawers to see that no article was left behind; and now having nothing more to do, I sat down and tried to rest.
<p/>I could not; though I had been on foot all day, I could not now repose an instant; I was too much excited.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>that lady</b></font>)</div>I now busied myself in preparations: the fortnight passed rapidly. The box was corded, the card nailed on. A phase of my life was closing to-night,
<p/>a new one opening to-morrow: impossible to slumber in the interval ; I must watch feverishly while the change was being accomplished.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>a servant</b></font>)</div>said a servant who met me in the lobby, where I was wandering like a troubled spirit, <div class="bookquote">``a person below wishes to see you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was passing the back-parlour or teachers' sitting-room, the door of which was half open, to go to the kitchen, when some one ran out--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The carrier, no doubt,''  (<font color='red'><b>teachers</b></font>)</div>I thought, and ran downstairs without inquiry. ``It's her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), I am sure!--I could have told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) anywhere!
<p/>I saw a woman attired like a well-dressed servant, matronly, yet still young; very good-looking, with black hair and eyes, and lively complexion.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) asked, in a voice and with a smile I half recognised; <div class="bookquote">``you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' cried the individual who stopped my progress and took my hand. I looked: '' Well, who is it? '' In another second I was embracing and kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) rapturously: <div class="bookquote">``Bessie!
<p/>Bessie! Bessie! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that was all I said; whereat she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) half laughed, half cried, and we both went into the parlour.
<p/>By the fire stood a little fellow of three years old, in plaid frock and trousers. '' That is my little boy,'' said Bessie directly.
<p/>Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane.''
<p/>'' Then you are married, Bessie?'' '' '' And you don't live at Gateshead?'' <div class="bookquote">``I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, and how do they all get on? Tell me everything about them, Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will you?
<p/>'' but Bobby preferred sidling over to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bobby</b></font>) mother. '' You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,'' continued Mrs. Leaven.
<p/>I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) went up to London last winter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mama, and there everybody admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), and a young lord fell in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>): but his (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he (<font color='blue'><b>lord</b></font>) and
<p/>'' '' '' Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?'' '' Very. Miss Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.
<p/>: I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was envious; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always quarrelling--
<p/>It was Miss Reed that found them out '' '' Well, and what of John Reed?'' '' Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) is not doing so well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) mama could wish.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) went to college, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) uncles wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) to be a barrister, and study the law: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) is such a dissipated young man, they will never make much of him (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>), I think.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``What does he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) look like?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) is very tall: some people call him (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) a fine-looking young man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) has such thick lips.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``And Mrs. Reed? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>)'s not quite easy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) mind:
<p/>No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach.
<p/>Mr. John's conduct does not please her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) spends a deal of money.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) send you here, Bessie?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said this laughing: I perceived that Bessie's glance, though it expressed regard, did in no shape denote admiration. ''
<p/>No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you:
<p/>I smiled at Bessie's frank answer: I felt that it was correct, but I confess I was not quite indifferent to its import:
<p/>at eighteen most people wish to please, and the conviction that they have not an exterior likely to second that desire brings anything but gratification.
<p/>you were no beauty as a child. '' '' I dare say you are clever, though,'' continued Bessie, by way of solace.
<p/>There was one in the room; Bessie went and opened it, and then asked me to sit down and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) a tune: I played a waltz or two, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was charmed.
<p/>'' What can you do? Can you play on the piano?'' '' A little. '' '' The Miss Reeds could not play as well!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Reeds</b></font>) exultingly.
<p/>'' I always said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?'' '' That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.
<p/>It was a landscape in water colours, of which I had made a present to the superintendent, in acknowledgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reeds</b></font>) obliging mediation with the committee on my behalf, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Reeds</b></font>) had framed and glazed.
<p/>It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves, who could not come near it: and
<p/>'' '' Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane! have you learnt French?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And you can work on muslin and canvas?'' <div class="bookquote">``I can. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady Jane</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!
<p/>I knew you would be: you will get on whether your relations notice you or not. There was something I wanted to ask you.
<p/>Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) seemed so much disappointed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) could not stay: he (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two.
<p/>Have you ever heard anything from your father's kinsfolk, the Eyres?'' '' Never in my life. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was your father's brother.
<p/>'' '' What foreign country was he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) going to, Bessie?'' '' An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did tell me--'' <div class="bookquote">``Madeira?
<p/>Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high with him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) called him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) afterwards a `sneaking tradesman.'
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I suggested. '' Yes, that is it--that is the very word. '' <div class="bookquote">``So he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) went?''  (<font color='red'><b>Robert/Robert Leaven</b></font>)</div>'' My Robert believes he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was a wine-merchant.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned; <div class="bookquote">``or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Bessie and I conversed about old times an hour longer, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was obliged to leave me
<p/>: I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) again for a few minutes the next morning at Lowton, while I was waiting for the coach.
<p/>We parted finally at the door of the Brocklehurst Arms there: each went her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) separate way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) set off for the brow of Lowood Fell to meet the conveyance which was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) back to Gateshead, I mounted the vehicle which was to bear me to new duties and a new life in the unknown environs of Millcote.
<p/>A new chapter in a novel is something like a new scene in a play; and when I draw up the curtain this time, reader, you must fancy you see a room in the George Inn at Millcote, with such large figured papering on the walls as inn rooms have; such a carpet, such furniture, such ornaments on the mantelpiece, such prints, including a portrait of George the Third, and another of the Prince of Wales, and a representation of the death of Wolfe.
<p/>All this is visible to you by the light of an oil lamp hanging from the ceiling, and by that of an excellent fire, near which I sit in my cloak and bonnet; my muff and umbrella lie on the table, and I am warming away the numbness and chill contracted by sixteen hours' exposure to the rawness of an October day: I left Lowton at four o'clock a.m., and the Millcote town clock is now just striking eight.
<p/>I thought when the coach stopped here there would be some one to meet me; I looked anxiously round as I descended the wooden steps the <div class="bookquote">``boots''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>placed for my convenience, expecting to hear my name pronounced, and to see some description of carriage waiting to convey me to Thornfield.
<p/>Nothing of the sort was visible; and when I asked a waiter if any one had been to inquire after a Miss Eyre, I was answered in the negative: so I had no resource but to request to be shown into a private room: and here I am waiting, while all sorts of doubts and fears are troubling my thoughts.
<p/>It is a very strange sensation to inexperienced youth to feel itself quite alone in the world, cut adrift from every connection, uncertain whether the port to which it is bound can be reached, and prevented by many impediments from returning to that it has quitted.
<p/>The charm of adventure sweetens that sensation, the glow of pride warms it; but then the throb of fear disturbs it; and fear with me became predominant when half-an-hour elapsed and still I was alone.
<p/>CHAPTER XI Reader, though I look comfortably accommodated, I am not very tranquil in my mind. I bethought myself to ring the bell.
<p/>'' Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield? '' I asked of the waiter who answered the summons. ''
<p/>Thornfield? I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) vanished, but reappeared instantly-- <div class="bookquote">``Is your name Eyre, Miss?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>I jumped up, took my muff and umbrella, and hastened into the inn-passage: a man was standing by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.
<p/>This will be your luggage, I suppose?'' said the man rather abruptly when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) saw me, pointing to my trunk in the passage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Person here waiting for you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' Yes. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hoisted it on to the vehicle, which was a sort of car, and then I got in
<p/>; before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shut me up, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) how far it was to Thornfield. '' A matter of six miles.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How long shall we be before we get there?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Happen an hour and a half. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fastened the car door, climbed to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own seat outside, and we set off.
<p/>Our progress was leisurely, and gave me ample time to reflect; I was content to be at length so near the end of my journey; and as I leaned back in the comfortable though not elegant conveyance, I meditated much at my ease.
<p/>I suppose,'' thought I, <div class="bookquote">``judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with them.
<p/>I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
<p/>At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always spurned with scorn.
<p/>I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) does, I am not bound to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>)!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always answer. let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.
<p/>I let down the window and looked out; Millcote was behind us; judging by the number of its lights, it seemed a place of considerable magnitude, much larger than Lowton.
<p/>We were now, as far as I could see, on a sort of common; but there were houses scattered all over the district; I felt we were in a different region to Lowood, more populous, less picturesque; more stirring, less romantic.
<p/>The roads were heavy, the night misty; my conductor let his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) horse walk all the way, and the hour and a half extended, I verily believe, to two hours; at last he (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) turned in his (<font color='blue'><b>conductor</b></font>) seat and said--
<p/>Again I looked out: we were passing a church; I saw its low broad tower against the sky, and its bell was tolling a quarter; I saw a narrow galaxy of lights too, on a hillside, marking a village or hamlet.
<p/>About ten minutes after, the driver got down and opened a pair of gates: we passed through, and they clashed to behind us.
<p/>We now slowly ascended a drive, and came upon the long front of a house: candlelight gleamed from one curtained bow-window; all the rest were dark.
<p/>How far are we on our road now, I wonder? '' <div class="bookquote">``You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The car stopped at the front door; it was opened by a maid-servant; I alighted and went in.
<p/>Will you walk this way, ma'am?'' said the girl; and I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) across a square hall with high doors all round
<p/>: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) ushered me into a room whose double illumination of fire and candle at first dazzled me, contrasting as it did with the darkness to which my eyes had been for two hours inured; when I could see, however, a cosy and agreeable picture presented itself to my view.
<p/>A snug small room; a round table by a cheerful fire; an arm-chair high- backed and old-fashioned, wherein sat the neatest imaginable little elderly lady, in widow's cap, black silk gown, and snowy muslin apron; exactly like what I had fancied Mrs. Fairfax, only less stately and milder looking.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) was occupied in knitting; a large cat sat demurely at her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) feet; nothing in short was wanting to complete the beau-ideal of domestic comfort.
<p/>no stateliness to embarrass; and then, as I entered, the old lady got up and promptly and kindly came forward to meet me.
<p/>'' A more reassuring introduction for a new governess could scarcely be conceived; there was no grandeur to overwhelm, '' How do you do, my dear?
<p/>I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) conducted me to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own chair, and then began to remove my shawl and untie my bonnet-strings; I begged she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not give herself so much trouble.
<p/>'' Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose? '' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Yes, you are right: do sit down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold.
<p/>Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of the storeroom. '' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) produced from her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) pocket a most housewifely bunch of keys, and delivered them to the servant.
<p/>'' Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) continued. '' You've brought your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?''
<p/>'' Yes, ma'am.'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll see it carried into your room,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) said, and bustled out. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) treats me like a visitor,'' thought I.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I little expected such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too soon.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) returned; with her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) own hands cleared her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) knitting apparatus and a book or two from the table, to make room for the tray which Leah now brought, and then herself handed me the refreshments.
<p/>I felt rather confused at being the object of more attention than I had ever before received, and, that too, shown by my employer and superior; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) did not herself seem to consider she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) was doing anything out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) place, I thought it better to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) civilities quietly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>'' Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night? '' I asked, when I had partaken of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) offered me. ''
<p/>What did you say, my dear? I am a little deaf,'' returned the good lady, approaching her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) ear to my mouth.
<p/>I repeated the question more distinctly. '' Miss Fairfax? Oh, you mean Miss Varens! Varens is the name of your future pupil.''
<p/>I should have followed up my first inquiry, by asking in what way Miss Varens was connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); but I recollected it was not polite to ask too many questions: besides, I was sure to hear in time.
<p/>I am so glad,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) continued, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sat down opposite to me, and took the cat on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knee; ``I am so glad you are come; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion.
<p/>To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.
<p/>Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wife are very decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due distance, for fear of losing one's authority.
<p/>I'm sure last winter -LRB-it was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and blew-RRB-, not a creature but
<p/>the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone
<p/>; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt it confining.
<p/>In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) nurse
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) is not your daughter?''  (<font color='red'><b>nurse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No,--I have no family. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I say alone-- : a child makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here
<p/>My heart really warmed to the worthy lady as I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) talk; and I drew my chair a little nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and expressed my sincere wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might find my company as agreeable as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) anticipated.
<p/>But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel tired.
<p/>I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary
<p/>I shall be quite gay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your bedroom. , I never sleep in them myself.
<p/>I thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) considerate choice, and as I really felt fatigued with my long journey, expressed my readiness to retire.
<p/>First she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went to see if the hall-door was fastened; having taken the key from the lock, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) led the way upstairs.
<p/>The steps and banisters were of oak; the staircase window was high and latticed; both it and the long gallery into which the bedroom doors opened looked as if they belonged to a church rather than a house.
<p/>A very chill and vault-like air pervaded the stairs and gallery, suggesting cheerless ideas of space and solitude; and I was glad, when finally ushered into my chamber, to find it of small dimensions, and furnished in ordinary, modern style.
<p/>When Mrs. Fairfax had bidden me a kind good-night, and I had fastened my door, gazed leisurely round, and in some measure effaced the eerie impression made by that wide hall, that dark and spacious staircase, and that long, cold gallery, by the livelier aspect of my little room, I remembered that, after a day of bodily fatigue and mental anxiety, I was now at last in safe haven.
<p/>The impulse of gratitude swelled my heart, and I knelt down at the bedside, and offered up thanks where thanks were due; not forgetting, ere I rose, to implore aid on my further path, and the power of meriting the kindness which seemed so frankly offered me before it was earned.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) candle, and I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) from the room. My couch had no thorns in it that night; my solitary room no fears.
<p/>The chamber looked such a bright little place to me as the sun shone in between the gay blue chintz window curtains, showing papered walls and a carpeted floor, so unlike the bare planks and stained plaster of Lowood, that my spirits rose at the view.
<p/>Externals have a great effect on the young: I thought that a fairer era of life was beginning for me, one that was to have its flowers and pleasures, as well as its thorns and toils.
<p/>At once weary and content, I slept soon and soundly: when I awoke it was broad day. My faculties, roused by the change of scene, the new field offered to hope, seemed all astir.
<p/>I cannot precisely define what they expected, but it was something pleasant: not perhaps that day or that month, but at an indefinite future period.
<p/>I rose; I dressed myself with care: obliged to be plain--for I had no article of attire that was not made with extreme simplicity--I was still by nature solicitous to be neat.
<p/>It was not my habit to be disregardful of appearance or careless of the impression I made: on the contrary, I ever wished to look as well as I could, and to please as much as my want of beauty would permit.
<p/>I sometimes regretted that I was not handsomer; I sometimes wished to have rosy cheeks, a straight nose, and small cherry mouth; I desired to be tall, stately, and finely developed in figure; I felt it
<p/>a misfortune that I was so little, so pale, and had features so irregular and so marked. And why had I these aspirations and these regrets?
<p/>It would be difficult to say: I could not then distinctly say it to myself; yet I had a reason, and a logical, natural reason too.
<p/>However, when I had brushed my hair very smooth, and put on my black frock--which, Quakerlike as it was, at least had the merit of fitting to a nicety--and adjusted my clean white tucker, I thought I should do respectably enough to appear before Mrs. Fairfax, and that my new pupil would not at least recoil from me with antipathy.
<p/>Having opened my chamber window, and seen that I left all things straight and neat on the toilet table, I ventured forth.
<p/>Traversing the long and matted gallery, I descended the slippery steps of oak; then I gained the hall: I halted there a minute; I looked at some pictures on the walls -LRB-one, I remember, represented a grim man in a cuirass, and one a lady with powdered hair and a pearl necklace-RRB-, at a bronze lamp pendent from the ceiling, at a great clock whose case was of oak curiously carved, and ebon black with time and rubbing.
<p/>Everything appeared very stately and imposing to me; but then I was so little accustomed to grandeur. The hall-door, which was half of glass, stood open; I stepped over the threshold.
<p/>It was a fine autumn morning; the early sun shone serenely on embrowned groves and still green fields; advancing on to the lawn, I looked up and surveyed the front of the mansion.
<p/>It was three storeys high, of proportions not vast, though considerable: a gentleman's manor-house, not a nobleman's seat: battlements round the top gave it a picturesque look.
<p/>Its grey front stood out well from the background of a rookery, whose cawing tenants were now on the wing: they flew over the lawn and grounds to alight in a great meadow, from which these were separated by a sunk fence, and where an array of mighty old thorn trees, strong, knotty, and broad as oaks, at once explained the etymology of the mansion's designation.
<p/>so like barriers of separation from the living world; but yet quiet and lonely hills enough, and seeming to embrace Thornfield with a seclusion I had not expected to find existent so near the stirring locality of Millcote.
<p/>A little hamlet, whose roofs were blent with trees, straggled up the side of one of these hills; the church of the district stood nearer Thornfield: its old tower-top looked over a knoll between the house and gates.
<p/>I was yet enjoying the calm prospect and pleasant fresh air, yet listening with delight to the cawing of the rooks, yet surveying the wide, hoary front of the hall, and thinking what a great place it was for one lonely little dame like Mrs. Fairfax to inhabit, when that lady appeared at the door.
<p/>Farther off were hills: not so lofty as those round Lowood, nor so craggy, nor '' What! out already?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>'' I see you are an early riser. '' I went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), and was received with an affable kiss and shake of the hand.
<p/>Yes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) head to come and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>How do you like Thornfield? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) asked. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) I liked it very much. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Rochester!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I exclaimed. '' Who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)?'' '' The owner of Thornfield,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) responded quietly. '' Did you not know he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was called Rochester?
<p/>Of course I did not--I had never heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) before; but the old lady seemed to regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) existence as a universally understood fact, with which everybody must be acquainted by instinct.
<p/>'' '' I thought,'' I continued, <div class="bookquote">``Thornfield belonged to you.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``To me? Bless you, child; what an idea! To me! I am only the housekeeper--the manager.
<p/>To be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was a clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and that church near the gates was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
<p/>The present Mr. Rochester's mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I expect nothing more.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the girl pupil</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And the little girl--my pupil!'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is Mr. Rochester's ward; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) commissioned me to find a governess for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) intended to have her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) brought up in --shire, I believe.
<p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) comes, with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) `bonne,' as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) calls her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) nurse. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The enigma then was explained: this affable and kind little widow was no great dame; but a dependant like myself.
<p/>The equality between her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) and me was real; not the mere result of condescension on her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) part: so much the better--my position was all the freer.
<p/>I did not like her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) the worse for that; on the contrary, I felt better pleased than ever. As I was meditating on this discovery, a little girl, followed by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) attendant, came running up the lawn.
<p/>I looked at my pupil, who did not at first appear to notice me: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was quite a child, perhaps seven or eight years old, slightly built, with a pale, small-featured face, and a redundancy of hair falling in curls to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) waist.
<p/>'' Good morning, Miss Adela,'' said Mrs. Fairfax. <div class="bookquote">``Come and speak to the lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) approached. '' C'est la ma gouverante! '' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), pointing to me, and addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) nurse; who answered-- <div class="bookquote">``Mais oui, certainement.''
 (<font color='red'><b>nurse</b></font>)</div><p/>The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I believe, never left it till within six months ago.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) first came here she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) could speak no English; now she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) can make shift to talk it a little: I don't understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) mixes it so with French; but you will make out her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) meaning very well
<p/>Fortunately I had had the advantage of being taught French by a French lady; and as I had always made a point of conversing with Madame Pierrot as often as I could, and had besides, during the last seven years, learnt a portion of French by heart daily--applying myself to take pains with my accent, and imitating as closely as possible the pronunciation of my teacher, I had acquired a certain degree of readiness and correctness in the language, and was not likely to be much at a loss with Mademoiselle Adela.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) came and shook hand with me when she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) heard that I was her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) governess; and as I led her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) in to breakfast, I addressed some phrases to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) own tongue: she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) replied briefly at first, but after we were seated at the table, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) had examined me some ten minutes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) large hazel eyes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>) suddenly commenced chattering fluently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are they foreigners? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, amazed at hearing the French language. '' , I dare say. '' '' Ah! '' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Adela</b></font>), in French, <div class="bookquote">``you speak my language as well as
<p/>Mr. Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), and so can Sophie. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) will be glad: nobody here understands her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>): Madame Fairfax is all English.
<p/>Sophie is my nurse; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and
<p/>I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and
<p/>I had little beds in another place. I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf. And Mademoiselle--what is your name?''
 (<font color='red'><b>French</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.
<p/>We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Eyre--Jane Eyre.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Aire? Bah! I cannot say it. <div class="bookquote">``Can you understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) runs on so fast?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Fairfax.
<p/>I wish,'' continued the good lady, <div class="bookquote">``you would ask her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a question or two about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) parents: I wonder if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) remembers them?''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div><p/>I understood her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) very well, for I had been accustomed to the fluent tongue of Madame Pierrot. '' <div class="bookquote">``Adele,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, <div class="bookquote">``with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I lived long ago with mama; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) is gone to the Holy Virgin. Mama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.
<p/>A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them:
<p/>I liked it. Shall I let you hear me sing now? ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) breakfast, so I permitted her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) to give a specimen of her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) accomplishments.
<p/>Descending from her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) chair, she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) came and placed herself on my knee; then, folding her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) little hands demurely before her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>), shaking back her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) curls and lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) eyes to the ceiling, she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) commenced singing a song from some opera.
<p/>It was the strain of a forsaken lady, who, after bewailing the perfidy of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lover, calls pride to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) aid; desires her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) attendant to deck her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) brightest jewels and richest robes, and resolves to meet the false one that night at a ball, and prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>), by the gaiety of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) demeanour, how little his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) desertion has affected her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>).
<p/>The subject seemed strangely chosen for an infant singer; but I suppose the point of the exhibition lay in hearing the notes of love and jealousy warbled with the lisp of childhood; and in very bad taste that point was: at least I thought so.
<p/>Adele sang the canzonette tunefully enough, and with the naivete of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) age. This achieved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) jumped from my knee and said, <div class="bookquote">``Now, Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) then declaimed the little piece with an attention to punctuation and emphasis, a flexibility of voice and an appropriateness of gesture, very unusual indeed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) age, and which proved she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had been carefully trained.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Assuming an attitude, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">``La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Was it your mama who taught you that piece?
<p/>'' I asked. '' Yes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) just used to say it in this way: `Qu' avez vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) made me lift my hand--so--to remind me to raise my voice at the question. Now shall I dance for you?''
<p/>No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you say, with whom did you live then?''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``With Madame Frederic and her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) husband: she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) took care of me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) is nothing related to me. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) is poor, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) had not so fine a house as mama.
<p/>Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) has not kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) word, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) has brought me to England, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) is gone back again himself, and I never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>).
<p/>After breakfast, Adele and I withdrew to the library, which room, it appears, Mr. Rochester had directed should be used as the schoolroom.
<p/>Most of the books were locked up behind glass doors; but there was one bookcase left open containing everything that could be needed in the way of elementary works, and several volumes of light literature, poetry, biography, travels, a few romances, &c.
<p/>I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had considered that these were all the governess would require for her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) private perusal; and, indeed, they contented me amply for the present; compared with the scanty pickings I had now and then been able to glean at Lowood, they seemed to offer an abundant harvest of entertainment and information.
<p/>In this room, too, there was a cabinet piano, quite new and of superior tone; also an easel for painting and a pair of globes.
<p/>I found my pupil sufficiently docile, though disinclined to apply: she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had not been used to regular occupation of any kind.
<p/>I felt it would be injudicious to confine her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) too much at first; so, when I had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) a great deal, and got her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) to learn a little, and when the morning had advanced to noon, I allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) to return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) nurse.
<p/>I was not long there. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I then proposed to occupy myself till dinner-time in drawing some little sketches for her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) use.
<p/>As I was going upstairs to fetch my portfolio and pencils, Mrs. Fairfax called to me: <div class="bookquote">``Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>).
<p/>It was a large, stately apartment, with purple chairs and curtains, a Turkey carpet, walnut-panelled walls, one vast window rich in slanted glass, and a lofty ceiling, nobly moulded.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was in a room the folding-doors of which stood open: I went in when she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) addressed me. Mrs. Fairfax was dusting some vases of fine purple spar, which stood on a sideboard.
<p/>'' What a beautiful room! '' I exclaimed, as I looked round; for I had never before seen any half so imposing.
<p/>I have just opened the window, to let in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) pointed to a wide arch corresponding to the window, and hung like it with a Tyrian-dyed curtain, now looped up.
<p/>Mounting to it by two broad steps, and looking through, I thought I caught a glimpse of a fairy place, so bright to my novice-eyes appeared the view beyond.
<p/>Yet it was merely a very pretty drawing-room, and within it a boudoir, both spread with white carpets, on which seemed laid brilliant garlands of flowers; both ceiled with snowy mouldings of white grapes and vine-leaves, beneath which glowed in rich contrast crimson couches and ottomans; while the ornaments on the pale Parian mantelpiece were of sparkling Bohemian glass, ruby red; and between the windows large mirrors repeated the general blending of snow and fire.
<p/>In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!'' said I. ``No dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they were inhabited daily.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not particularly so; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) expects to have things managed in conformity to them.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes; this is the dining-room. '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)?
<p/>Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) generally liked?'' '' Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here. '' Well, but, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) land out of the question, do you like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have no cause to do otherwise than like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); and I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is considered a just and liberal landlord by his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) tenants: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has never lived much amongst them.
<p/>Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) liked for himself?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' But has he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) no peculiarities? What, in short, is his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) character?'' '' Oh! his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) character is unimpeachable, I suppose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is rather peculiar, perhaps: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, I should think.
<p/>I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is clever, but I never had much conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``In what way is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) peculiar?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel it when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is in jest or earnest, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is a very good master.
<p/>There are people who seem to have no notion of sketching a character, or observing and describing salient points, either in persons or things: the good lady evidently belonged to this class; my queries puzzled, but did not draw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) out.
<p/>Mr. Rochester was Mr. Rochester in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eyes; a gentleman, a landed proprietor--nothing more: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) inquired and searched no further, and evidently wondered at my wish to gain a more definite notion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) identity.
<p/>When we left the dining-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) proposed to show me over the rest of the house; and I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) upstairs and downstairs, admiring as I went; for all was well arranged and handsome.
<p/>The large front chambers I thought especially grand: and some of the third-storey rooms, though dark and low, were interesting from their air of antiquity.
<p/>The furniture once appropriated to the lower apartments had from time to time been removed here, as fashions changed: and the imperfect light entering by their narrow casement showed bedsteads of a hundred years old; chests in oak or walnut, looking, with their strange carvings of palm branches and cherubs' heads, like types of the Hebrew ark; rows of venerable chairs, high-backed and narrow; stools still more antiquated, on whose cushioned tops were yet apparent traces of half-effaced embroideries, wrought by fingers that for two generations had been coffin-dust.
<p/>All these relics gave to the third storey of Thornfield Hall the aspect of a home of the past: a shrine of memory.
<p/>I liked the hush, the gloom, the quaintness of these retreats in the day; but I by no means coveted a night's repose on one of those wide and heavy beds: shut in, some of them, with doors of oak; shaded, others, with wrought old English hangings crusted with thick work, portraying effigies of strange flowers, and stranger birds, and strangest human beings,--all which would have looked strange, indeed, by the pallid gleam of moonlight.
<p/>'' This was all the account I got from Mrs. Fairfax of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) employer and mine. '' Do the servants sleep in these rooms?
<p/>No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.''
<p/>'' I asked. '' '' So I think: you have no ghost, then?'' '' None that I ever heard of,'' returned Mrs. Fairfax, smiling.
<p/>And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.
<p/>'' Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?'' <div class="bookquote">``I believe not. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes--`after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered.
<p/>'' Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax? '' for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was moving away. '' On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?
<p/>I followed still, up a very narrow staircase to the attics, and thence by a ladder and through a trap-door to the roof of the hall.
<p/>Leaning over the battlements and looking far down, I surveyed the grounds laid out like a map: the bright and velvet lawn closely girdling the grey base of the mansion; the field, wide as a park, dotted with its ancient timber; the wood, dun and sere, divided by a path visibly overgrown, greener with moss than the trees were with foliage; the church at the gates, the road, the tranquil hills, all reposing in the autumn day's sun; the horizon bounded by a propitious sky, azure, marbled with pearly white.
<p/>'' I was now on a level with the crow colony, and could see into their nests. No feature in the scene was extraordinary, but all was pleasing.
<p/>the attic seemed black as a vault compared with that arch of blue air to which I had been looking up, and to that sunlit scene of grove, pasture, and green hill, of which the hall was the centre, and over which I had been gazing with delight.
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax stayed behind a moment to fasten the trap-door; I, by drift of groping, found the outlet from the attic, and proceeded to descend the narrow garret staircase.
<p/>I lingered in the long passage to which this led, separating the front and back rooms of the third storey: narrow, low, and dim, with only one little window at the far end, and looking, with its two rows of small black doors all shut, like a corridor in some Bluebeard's castle.
<p/>While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ear.
<p/>When I turned from it and repassed the trap-door, I could scarcely see my way down the ladder; It was a curious laugh; distinct, formal, mirthless.
<p/>I stopped: the sound ceased, only for an instant; it began again, louder: for at first, though distinct, it was very low.
<p/>It passed off in a clamorous peal that seemed to wake an echo in every lonely chamber; though it originated but in one, and I could have pointed out the door whence the accents issued.
<p/>'' Mrs. Fairfax! '' I called out: for I now heard her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) descending the great stairs. '' Did you hear that loud laugh?
<p/>Who is it?'' <div class="bookquote">``Some of the servants, very likely,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered: <div class="bookquote">``perhaps Grace Poole.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you hear it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I again inquired.
<p/>'' Yes, plainly: I often hear her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sews in one of these rooms. Sometimes Leah is with her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>); they are frequently noisy together.
<p/>I really did not expect any Grace to answer; for the laugh was as tragic, as preternatural a laugh as any I ever heard; and, but that it was high noon, and that no circumstance of ghostliness accompanied the curious cachinnation; but that neither scene nor season favoured fear, I should have been superstitiously afraid.
<p/>'' The laugh was repeated in its low, syllabic tone, and terminated in an odd murmur. <div class="bookquote">``Grace!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax. However, the event showed me I was a fool for entertaining a sense even of surprise.
<p/>The door nearest me opened, and a servant came out,--a woman of between thirty and forty; a set, square-made figure, red-haired, and with a hard, plain face: any apparition less romantic or less ghostly could scarcely be conceived.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) housemaid's work,'' continued the widow; <div class="bookquote">``not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) does well enough.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the widow</b></font>)</div>Too much noise, Grace,'' said Mrs. Fairfax. <div class="bookquote">``Remember directions!''  (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div>Grace curtseyed silently and went in. '' By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new pupil this morning?
<p/>'' The conversation, thus turned on Adele, continued till we reached the light and cheerful region below. Adele came running to meet us in the hall, exclaiming-- <div class="bookquote">``Mesdames, vous etes servies!''  (<font color='red'><b>Adele</b></font>)</div>adding, <div class="bookquote">``J'ai bien faim, moi!
<p/>The promise of a smooth career, which my first calm introduction to Thornfield Hall seemed to pledge, was not belied on a longer acquaintance with the place and its inmates.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Adele</b></font>)</div>We found dinner ready, and waiting for us in Mrs. Fairfax's room. CHAPTER XII Mrs. Fairfax turned out to be what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) appeared, a placid-tempered, kind-natured woman, of competent education and average intelligence.
<p/>My pupil was a lively child, who had been spoilt and indulged, and therefore was sometimes wayward; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was committed entirely to my care, and no injudicious interference from any quarter ever thwarted my plans for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) improvement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) soon forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) little freaks, and became obedient and teachable.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had no great talents, no marked traits of character, no peculiar development of feeling or taste which raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) one inch above the ordinary level of childhood; but neither had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) any deficiency or vice which sunk her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) below it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) made reasonable progress, entertained for me a vivacious, though perhaps not very profound, affection; and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) simplicity, gay prattle, and efforts to please, inspired me, in return, with a degree of attachment sufficient to make us both content in each other's society.
<p/>This, par parenthese , will be thought cool language by persons who entertain solemn doctrines about the angelic nature of children, and the duty of those charged with their education to conceive for them an idolatrous devotion: but I am not writing to flatter parental egotism, to echo cant, or prop up humbug; I am merely telling the truth.
<p/>I felt a conscientious solicitude for Adele's welfare and progress, and a quiet liking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) little self: just as I cherished towards Mrs. Fairfax a thankfulness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) kindness, and a pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) society proportionate to the tranquil regard she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had for me, and the moderation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) mind and character.
<p/>Anybody may blame me who likes, when I add further, that, now and then, when I took a walk by myself in the grounds; when I went down to the gates and looked through them along the road; or when, while Adele played with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) nurse, and Mrs. Fairfax made jellies in the storeroom, I climbed the three staircases, raised the trap-door of the attic, and having reached the leads, looked out afar over sequestered field and hill, and along dim sky-line--that then I longed for a power of vision which might overpass that limit; which might reach the busy world, towns, regions full of life I had heard of but never seen--that then I desired more of practical experience than I possessed; more of intercourse with my kind, of acquaintance with variety of character, than was here within my reach.
<p/>I valued what was good in Mrs. Fairfax, and what was good in Adele; but I believed in the existence of other and more vivid kinds of goodness, and what I believed in I wished to behold.
<p/>Who blames me? Many, no doubt; and I shall be called discontented. I could not help it: the restlessness was in my nature; it agitated me to pain sometimes.
<p/>Then my sole relief was to walk along the corridor of the third storey, backwards and forwards, safe in the silence and solitude of the spot, and allow my mind's eye to dwell on whatever bright visions rose before it--and, certainly, they were many and glowing; to let my heart be heaved by the exultant movement, which, while it swelled it in trouble, expanded it with life; and, best of all, to open my inward ear to a tale that was never ended--a tale my imagination created, and narrated continuously; quickened with all of incident, life, fire, feeling, that I desired and had not in my actual existence.
<p/>It is in vain to say human beings ought to be satisfied with tranquillity: they must have action; and they will make it if they cannot find it.
<p/>Millions are condemned to a stiller doom than mine, and millions are in silent revolt against their lot. Nobody knows how many rebellions besides political rebellions ferment in the masses of life which people earth.
<p/>Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts, as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.
<p/>It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.
<p/>When thus alone, I not unfrequently heard Grace Poole's laugh: the same peal, the same low, slow ha! ha! which, when first heard, had thrilled me: I heard, too, her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eccentric murmurs;
<p/>There were days when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was quite silent; but there were others when I could not account for the sounds she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) made.
<p/>Sometimes I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would come out of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) room with a basin, or a plate, or a tray in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hand, go down to the kitchen and shortly return, generally -LRB-oh, romantic reader, forgive me for telling the plain truth!-RRB-
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) appearance always acted as a damper to the curiosity raised by her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) oral oddities: hard-featured and staid, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had no point to which interest could attach.
<p/>I made some attempts to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) into conversation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seemed a person of few words: a monosyllabic reply usually cut short every effort of that sort.
<p/>The other members of the household, viz., John and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wife, Leah the housemaid, and Sophie the French nurse, were decent people; but in no respect remarkable; with Sophie I used to talk French, and sometimes I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) questions about her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) native country; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) was not of a descriptive or narrative turn, and generally gave such vapid and confused answers as were calculated rather to check than encourage inquiry.
<p/>One afternoon in January, Mrs. Fairfax had begged a holiday for Adele, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had a cold; and, as Adele seconded the request with an ardour that reminded me how precious occasional holidays had been to me in my own childhood, I accorded it, deeming that I did well in showing pliability on the point.

<p/>Mrs. Fairfax had just written a letter which was waiting to be posted, so I put on my bonnet and cloak and volunteered to carry it to Hay; the distance, two miles, would be a pleasant winter afternoon walk.
<p/>Having seen Adele comfortably seated in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) little chair by Mrs. Fairfax's parlour fireside, and given her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) best wax doll -LRB-which I usually kept enveloped in silver paper in a drawer-RRB- to play with, and a story-book for change of amusement; and having replied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Revenez bientot
<p/>; I was tired of sitting still in the library through a whole long morning: , ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle.
<p/>The ground was hard, the air was still, my road was lonely; I walked fast till I got warm, and then I walked slowly to enjoy and analyse the species of pleasure brooding for me in the hour and situation.
<p/>It was three o'clock; the church bell tolled as I passed under the belfry: the charm of the hour lay in its approaching dimness, in the low-gliding and pale-beaming sun.
<p/>I was a mile from Thornfield, in a lane noted for wild roses in summer, for nuts and blackberries in autumn, and even now possessing a few coral treasures in hips and haws, but whose best winter delight lay in its utter solitude and leafless repose.
<p/>If a breath of air stirred, it made no sound here; for there was not a holly, not an evergreen to rustle, and the stripped hawthorn and hazel bushes were as still as the white, worn stones which causewayed the middle of the path.
<p/>Far and wide, on each side, there were only fields, where no cattle now browsed; and the little brown birds, which stirred occasionally in the hedge, looked like single russet leaves that had forgotten to drop.
<p/>This lane inclined up-hill all the way to Hay; having reached the middle, I sat down on a stile which led thence into a field.
<p/>Gathering my mantle about me, and sheltering my hands in my muff, I did not feel the cold, though it froze keenly; as was attested by a sheet of ice covering the causeway, where a little brooklet, now congealed, had overflowed after a rapid thaw some days since.
<p/>From my seat I could look down on Thornfield: the grey and battlemented hall was the principal object in the vale below me
<p/>Jeannette,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>with a kiss I set out. ; its woods and dark rookery rose against the west. I lingered till the sun went down amongst the trees, and sank crimson and clear behind them.
<p/>On the hill-top above me sat the rising moon; pale yet as a cloud, but brightening momentarily, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jeannette</b></font>) looked over Hay, which, half lost in trees, sent up a blue smoke from its few chimneys:
<p/>I then turned eastward. it was yet a mile distant, but in the absolute hush I could hear plainly its thin murmurs of life.
<p/>My ear, too, felt the flow of currents; in what dales and depths I could not tell: but there were many hills beyond Hay, and doubtless many becks threading their passes.
<p/>A rude noise broke on these fine ripplings and whisperings, at once so far away and so clear: a positive tramp, tramp, a metallic clatter, which effaced the soft wave-wanderings; as, in a picture, the solid mass of a crag, or the rough boles of a great oak, drawn in dark and strong on the foreground, efface the aerial distance of azure hill, sunny horizon, and blended clouds where tint melts into tint.
<p/>The din was on the causeway: a horse was coming; the windings of the lane yet hid it, but it approached.
<p/>That evening calm betrayed alike the tinkle of the nearest streams, the sough of the most remote. I was just leaving the stile; yet, as the path was narrow, I sat still to let it go by.
<p/>In those days I was young, and all sorts of fancies bright and dark tenanted my mind: the memories of nursery stories were there amongst other rubbish; and when they recurred, maturing youth added to them a vigour and vividness beyond what childhood could give.
<p/>As this horse approached, and as I watched for it to appear through the dusk, I remembered certain of Bessie's tales, wherein figured a North-of-England spirit called a <div class="bookquote">``Gytrash,''  (<font color='red'><b>Bessie/Bessie Leaven</b></font>)</div>which, in the form of horse, mule, or large dog, haunted solitary ways, and sometimes came upon belated travellers, as this horse was now coming upon me.
<p/>It was very near, but not yet in sight; when, in addition to the tramp, tramp, I heard a rush under the hedge, and close down by the hazel stems glided a great dog, whose black and white colour made him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) a distinct object against the trees.
<p/>It was exactly one form of Bessie's Gytrash--a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head: it passed me, however, quietly enough; not staying to look up, with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would.
<p/>The horse followed,--a tall steed, and on its back a rider. The man, the human being, broke the spell at once.
<p/>Nothing ever rode the Gytrash: it was always alone; and goblins, to my notions, though they might tenant the dumb carcasses of beasts, could scarce covet shelter in the commonplace human form.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) passed, and I went on; a few steps, and I turned: a sliding sound and an exclamation of <div class="bookquote">``What the deuce is to do now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and a clattering tumble, arrested my attention.
<p/>No Gytrash was this,--only a traveller taking the short cut to Millcote. Man and horse were down; they had slipped on the sheet of ice which glazed the causeway.
<p/>The dog came bounding back, and seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) master in a predicament, and hearing the horse groan, barked till the evening hills echoed the sound, which was deep in proportion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) magnitude.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) snuffed round the prostrate group, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) ran up to me; it was all he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) could do,--there was no other help at hand to summon.
<p/>I obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>), and walked down to the traveller, by this time struggling himself free of his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) steed. His (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) efforts were so vigorous, I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) could not be much hurt; but I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) the question--
<p/>'' I think he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) was swearing, but am not certain; however, he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) was pronouncing some formula which prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) from replying to me directly.
<p/>You must just stand on one side,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) answered as he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) rose, first to his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) knees, and then to his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) feet.
<p/>I did; whereupon began a heaving, stamping, clattering process, accompanied by a barking and baying which removed me effectually some yards' distance; but I would not be driven quite away till I saw the event.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Are you injured, sir? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Can I do anything? '' I asked again. '' This was finally fortunate; the horse was re-established, and the dog was silenced with a <div class="bookquote">``Down, Pilot!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div><p/>The traveller now, stooping, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) foot and leg, as if trying whether they were sound; apparently something ailed them, for he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) halted to the stile whence I had just risen, and sat down.
<p/>I was in the mood for being useful, or at least officious, I think, for I now drew near him (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) again.
<p/>'' If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.''
<p/>: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;'' and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) stood up and tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) foot, but the result extorted an involuntary <div class="bookquote">``Ugh!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>``Thank you: I shall do Something of daylight still lingered, and the moon was waxing bright: I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) plainly.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) figure was enveloped in a riding cloak, fur collared and steel clasped; its details were not apparent, but I traced the general points of middle height and considerable breadth of chest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) had a dark face, with stern features and a heavy brow; his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) eyes and gathered eyebrows looked ireful and thwarted just now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) was past youth, but had not reached middle-age; perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) might be thirty-five.
<p/>Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) been a handsome, heroic- looking young gentleman, I should not have dared to stand thus questioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) against his (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) will, and offering my services unasked.
<p/>I felt no fear of him (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>), and but little shyness. I had hardly ever seen a handsome youth; never in my life spoken to one.
<p/>I had a theoretical reverence and homage for beauty, elegance, gallantry, fascination; but had I met those qualities incarnate in masculine shape, I should have known instinctively that they neither had nor could have sympathy with anything in me, and should have shunned them as one would fire, lightning, or anything else that is bright but antipathetic.
<p/>If even this stranger had smiled and been good-humoured to me when I addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>); if he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had put off my offer of assistance gaily and with thanks, I should have gone on my way and not felt any vocation to renew inquiries: but the frown, the roughness of the traveller, set me at my ease: I retained my station when he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) waved to me to go, and announced--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) looked at me when I said this; he (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) had hardly turned his (<font color='blue'><b>traveller</b></font>) eyes in my direction before. '' ''

(<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and again my raiment underwent scrutiny. In two minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) rose from the stile: his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) face expressed pain when he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) tried to move.
<p/>'' I cannot commission you to fetch help,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``but you may help me a little yourself, if you will be so kind.

<p/>I sought it and found it. '' Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as you can.

<p/>The incident had occurred and was gone for me: it was an incident of no moment, no romance, no interest in a sense; yet it marked with change one single hour of a monotonous life.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the dog</b></font>)</div>'' I took up my muff and walked on. My help had been needed and claimed; I had given it:
<p/>I was pleased to have done something; trivial, transitory though the deed was, it was yet an active thing, and I was weary of an existence all passive.
<p/>The new face, too, was like a new picture introduced to the gallery of memory; and it was dissimilar to all the others hanging there: firstly, because it was masculine; and, secondly, because it was dark, strong, and stern.
<p/>I had it still before me when I entered Hay, and slipped the letter into the post-office; I saw it as I walked fast down-hill all the way home.
<p/>When I came to the stile, I stopped a minute, looked round and listened, with an idea that a horse's hoofs might ring on the causeway again, and that a rider in a cloak, and a Gytrash-like Newfoundland dog, might be again apparent: I saw only the hedge and a pollard willow before me, rising up still and straight to meet the moonbeams; I heard only the faintest waft of wind roaming fitful among the trees round Thornfield, a mile distant; and when I glanced down in the direction of the murmur, my eye, traversing the hall-front, caught a light kindling in a window: it reminded me that I was late, and I hurried on.
<p/>To pass its threshold was to return to stagnation; to cross the silent hall, to ascend the darksome staircase, to seek my own lonely little room, and then to meet tranquil Mrs. Fairfax, and spend the long winter evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) only, was to quell wholly the faint excitement wakened by my walk,--to slip again over my faculties the viewless fetters of an uniform and too still existence; of an existence whose very privileges of security and ease I was becoming incapable of appreciating.
<p/>What good it would have done me at that time to have been tossed in the storms of an uncertain struggling life, and to have been taught by rough and bitter experience to long for the calm amidst which I now repined!
<p/>Yes, just as much good as it would do a man tired of sitting still in a <div class="bookquote">``too easy chair''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>to take a long walk: and just as natural was the wish to stir, under my circumstances, as it would be under his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>I lingered at the gates; I lingered on the lawn; I paced backwards and forwards on the pavement; the shutters of the glass door were closed; I could not see into the interior; and both my eyes and spirit seemed drawn from the gloomy house--from the grey-hollow filled with rayless cells, as it appeared to me--to that sky expanded before me,--a blue sea absolved from taint of cloud; the moon ascending it in solemn march; her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) orb seeming to look up as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) left the hill-tops, from behind which she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had come, far and farther below her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and aspired to the zenith, midnight dark in its fathomless depth and measureless distance; and for those trembling stars that followed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) course; they made my heart tremble, my veins glow when I viewed them.
<p/>Little things recall us to earth; the clock struck in the hall; that sufficed; I turned from moon and stars, opened a side- door, and went in.
<p/>The hall was not dark, nor yet was it lit, only by the high-hung bronze lamp; a warm glow suffused both it and the lower steps of the oak staircase.
<p/>This ruddy shine issued from the great dining-room, whose two- leaved door stood open, and showed a genial fire in the grate, glancing on marble hearth and brass fire-irons, and revealing purple draperies and polished furniture, in the most pleasant radiance.
<p/>It revealed, too, a group near the mantelpiece: I had scarcely caught it, and scarcely become aware of a cheerful mingling of voices, amongst which I seemed to distinguish the tones of Adele, when the door closed.
<p/>I did not like re-entering Thornfield. I hastened to Mrs. Fairfax's room; there was a fire there too, but no candle, and no Mrs. Fairfax.
<p/>Instead, all alone, sitting upright on the rug, and gazing with gravity at the blaze, I beheld a great black and white long-haired dog, just like the Gytrash of the lane.
<p/>It was so like it that I went forward and said--<div class="bookquote">``Pilot''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and the thing got up and came to me and snuffed me.
<p/>I caressed him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) great tail; but he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked an eerie creature to be alone with, and I could not tell whence he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had come.
<p/>I rang the bell, for I wanted a candle; and I wanted, too, to get an account of this visitant. Leah entered.
<p/>'' What dog is this?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came with master.'' '' With whom? '' <div class="bookquote">``With master--Mr. Rochester--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is just arrived. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Adele</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) horse fell and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ankle is sprained.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Leah</b></font>)</div><p/>Leah brought it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) entered, followed by Mrs. Fairfax, who repeated the news; adding that Mr. Carter the surgeon was come, and was now with Mr. Rochester: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) hurried out to give orders about tea, and I went upstairs to take off my things.
<p/>Mr. Rochester, it seems, by the surgeon's orders, went to bed early that night; nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) rise soon next morning.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did come down, it was to attend to business: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) agent and some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) tenants were arrived, and waiting to speak with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! Bring me a candle will you Leah? ''  (<font color='red'><b>CHAPTER XIII Adele</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XIII Adele and I had now to vacate the library: it would be in daily requisition as a reception-room for callers.
<p/>A fire was lit in an apartment upstairs, and there I carried our books, and arranged it for the future schoolroom.
<p/>I discerned in the course of the morning that Thornfield Hall was a changed place: no longer silent as a church, it echoed every hour or two to a knock at the door, or a clang of the bell; steps, too, often traversed the hall, and new voices spoke in different keys below
<p/>; a rill from the outer world was flowing through it; it had a master: for my part, I liked it better.
<p/>Adele was not easy to teach that day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) could not apply: she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) kept running to the door and looking over the banisters to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) could get a glimpse of Mr. Rochester; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) coined pretexts to go downstairs, in order, as I shrewdly suspected, to visit the library, where I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was not wanted; then, when I got a little angry, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) sit still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) continued to talk incessantly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax de Rochester,

<p/>'' Et cela doit signifier,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.

<p/>I and my pupil dined as usual in Mrs. Fairfax's parlour; the afternoon was wild and snowy, and we passed it in the schoolroom.
<p/>At dark I allowed Adele to put away books and work, and to run downstairs; for, from the comparative silence below, and from the cessation of appeals to the door-bell, I conjectured that Mr. Rochester was now at liberty.
<p/>Left alone, I walked to the window; but nothing was to be seen thence: twilight and snowflakes together thickened the air, and hid the very shrubs on the lawn.
<p/>, assez mince et un peu pale. J'ai dit qu'oui: car c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I let down the curtain and went back to the fireside.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This additional ceremony seemed somewhat stately; however, I repaired to my room, and, with Mrs. Fairfax's aid, replaced my black stuff dress by one of black silk; the best and the only additional one I had, except one of light grey, which, in my Lowood notions of the toilette, I thought too fine to be worn, except on first-rate occasions.
<p/>'' Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here. '' '' You want a brooch,'' said Mrs. Fairfax.
<p/>I had a single little pearl ornament which Miss Temple gave me as a parting keepsake: I put it on, and then we went downstairs.
<p/>I let Mrs. Fairfax precede me into the dining-room, and kept in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shade as we crossed that apartment; and, passing the arch, whose curtain was now dropped, entered the elegant recess beyond.
<p/>Two wax candles stood lighted on the table, and two on the mantelpiece; basking in the light and heat of a superb fire, lay Pilot--Adele knelt near him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>Half reclined on a couch appeared Mr. Rochester, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) foot supported by the cushion; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was looking at Adele and the dog: the fire shone full on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) face.
<p/>Unused as I was to strangers, it was rather a trial to appear thus formally summoned in Mr. Rochester's presence. I knew my traveller with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) broad and jetty eyebrows;
<p/>I recognised his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) decisive nose, more remarkable for character than beauty; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) full nostrils, denoting, I thought, choler; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) grim mouth, chin, and jaw--
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) square forehead, made squarer by the horizontal sweep of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) black hair. yes, all three were very grim, and no mistake.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) shape, now divested of cloak, I perceived harmonised in squareness with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) physiognomy: I suppose it was a good figure in the athletic sense of the term--broad chested and thin flanked, though neither tall nor graceful.
<p/>Mr. Rochester must have been aware of the entrance of Mrs. Fairfax and myself; but it appeared he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was not in the mood to notice us, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) never lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) head as we approached.
<p/>'' Here is Miss Eyre, sir,'' said Mrs. Fairfax, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) quiet way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) bowed, still not taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eyes from the group of the dog and child.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let Miss Eyre be seated,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): and there was something in the forced stiff bow, in the impatient yet formal tone, which seemed further to express,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>).
<p/>A reception of finished politeness would probably have confused me: I could not have returned or repaid it by answering grace and elegance on my part; but harsh caprice laid me under no obligation; on the contrary, a decent quiescence, under the freak of manner, gave me the advantage.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I sat down quite disembarrassed. Besides, the eccentricity of the proceeding was piquant: I felt interested to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) would go on.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) went on as a statue would, that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) neither spoke nor moved. Mrs. Fairfax seemed to think it necessary that some one should be amiable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) began to talk.
<p/>Kindly, as usual--and, as usual, rather trite--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) condoled with him (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) on the pressure of business he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) had had all day; on the annoyance it must have been to him (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) with that painful sprain: then she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) commended his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) patience and perseverance in going through with it.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) hastened to ring the bell; and when the tray came, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) proceeded to arrange the cups, spoons, &c., with assiduous celerity.
<p/>'' Madam, I should like some tea,'' was the sole rejoinder she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) got. I and Adele went to the table; but the master did not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) couch.
<p/>'' Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?'' said Mrs. Fairfax to me; <div class="bookquote">``Adele might perhaps spill it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I did as requested.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) took the cup from my hand, Adele, thinking the moment propitious for making a request in my favour, cried out--
<p/>'' N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre?'' '' Who talks of cadeaux?
<p/>'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) gruffly. '' Did you expect a present, Miss Eyre? Are you fond of presents?'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) searched my face with eyes that I saw were dark, irate, and piercing.
<p/>'' I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally thought pleasant things.'' <div class="bookquote">``Generally thought? But what do you think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) demands a `cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) sees me: you beat about the bush.
<p/>Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) says you have always been in the habit of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) playthings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.
<p/>and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!
<p/>I have examined Adele, and find you have taken great pains with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) is not bright, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) has no talents; yet in a short time she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) has made much improvement.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Sir, you have now given me my `cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to the fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said the master, when the tray was taken away, and Mrs. Fairfax had settled into a corner with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) knitting; while Adele was leading me by the hand round the room, showing me the beautiful books and ornaments on the consoles and chiffonnieres.
<p/>We obeyed, as in duty bound; Adele wanted to take a seat on my knee, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was ordered to amuse herself with Pilot.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Humph!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Rochester, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) tea in silence. '' You have been resident in my house three months?''
<p/>'' Yes, sir.'' '' And you came from--?'' <div class="bookquote">``From Lowood school, in --shire.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! a charitable concern. How long were you there?

<p/>When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.
<p/>No wonder you have rather the look of another world. I marvelled where you had got that sort of face. Who are your parents?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have none.''

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head. '' The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago,'' said I, speaking as seriously as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had done.
<p/>'' And not even in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them. I don't think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their revels more.
<p/>'' Mrs. Fairfax had dropped her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) knitting, and, with raised eyebrows, seemed wondering what sort of talk this was. '' Well,'' resumed Mr. Rochester, <div class="bookquote">``if you disown parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No; none that I ever saw.'' '' And your home?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have none.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Where do your brothers and sisters live?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fairfax</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Fairfax. '' I have to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) for this sprain. '' The widow looked bewildered. '' Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?''
<p/>'' No, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Have you seen much society?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of Thornfield.

<p/>'' Oh, no. '' <div class="bookquote">``You are very cool! No! What! a novice not worship her (<font color='blue'><b>nun</b></font>) priest! That sounds blasphemous.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) cut off our hair; and for economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could hardly sew.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fairfax</b></font>)</div>'' That was very false economy,'' remarked Mrs. Fairfax, who now again caught the drift of the dialogue. '' And was that the head and front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) offending?'' demanded Mr. Rochester.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) starved us when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had the sole superintendence of the provision department, before the committee was appointed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) bored us with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed.
<p/>'' '' '' What age were you when you went to Lowood? '' <div class="bookquote">``About ten.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?
<p/>'' I assented. '' Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have been able to guess your age.
<p/>It is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.
<p/>And now what did you learn at Lowood? Can you play?'' '' A little.'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course: that is the established answer.

<p/>Go into the library--I mean, if you ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I departed, obeying his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) directions. '' Enough! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) called out in a few minutes.
<p/>'' You play a little , I see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not well.
<p/>'' I closed the piano and returned. Mr. Rochester continued--<div class="bookquote">``Adele showed me some sketches this morning, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) said were yours.
<p/>I don't know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>'' No, indeed!'' I interjected. ''
<p/>Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are certain: I can recognise patchwork.''
<p/>Ah! that pricks pride. <div class="bookquote">``Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I brought the portfolio from the library.
<p/>'' Approach the table,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); and I wheeled it to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) couch. Adele and Mrs. Fairfax drew near to see the pictures.
<p/>No crowding,'' said Mr. Rochester: <div class="bookquote">``take the drawings from my hand as I finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) deliberately scrutinised each sketch and painting. Three he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) laid aside; the others, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had examined them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) swept from him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and look at them with Adele;--you''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-glancing at me-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``resume your seat, and answer my questions.

<p/>They have taken much time, and some thought. '' <div class="bookquote">``I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no other occupation.

<p/>'' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Has it other furniture of the same kind within?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I should think it may have: I should hope--better.
<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is so occupied, I will tell you, reader, what they are: and first, I must premise that they are nothing wonderful.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) spread the pictures before him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and again surveyed them alternately. The subjects had, indeed, risen vividly on my mind.
<p/>As I saw them with the spiritual eye, before I attempted to embody them, they were striking; but my hand would not second my fancy, and in each case it had wrought out but a pale portrait of the thing I had conceived.
<p/>The first represented clouds low and livid, rolling over a swollen sea: all the distance was in eclipse; so, too, was the foreground; or rather,
<p/>One gleam of light lifted into relief a half-submerged mast, on which sat a cormorant, dark and large, with wings flecked with foam; its beak held a gold bracelet set with gems, that I had touched with as brilliant tints as my palette could yield, and as glittering distinctness as my pencil could impart.
<p/>Sinking below the bird and mast, a drowned corpse glanced through the green water; a fair arm was the only limb clearly visible, whence the bracelet had been washed or torn.
<p/>The second picture contained for foreground only the dim peak of a hill, with grass and some leaves slanting as if by a breeze.
<p/>Beyond and above spread an expanse of sky, dark blue as at twilight: rising into the sky was a woman's shape to the bust, portrayed in tints as dusk and soft as I could combine.
<p/>The dim forehead was crowned with a star; the lineaments below were seen as through the suffusion of vapour; the eyes shone dark and wild; the hair streamed shadowy, like a beamless cloud torn by storm or by electric travail.
<p/>On the neck lay a pale reflection like moonlight; the same faint lustre touched the train of thin clouds from which rose and bowed this vision of the Evening Star.
<p/>The third showed the pinnacle of an iceberg piercing a polar winter sky: a muster of northern lights reared their dim lances, close serried, along the horizon.
<p/>These pictures were in water-colours. the nearest billows, for there was no land. Throwing these into distance, rose, in the foreground, a head,--a colossal head, inclined towards the iceberg, and resting against it.
<p/>Two thin hands, joined under the forehead, and supporting it, drew up before the lower features a sable veil, a brow quite bloodless, white as bone, and an eye hollow and fixed, blank of meaning but for the glassiness of despair, alone were visible.
<p/>Above the temples, amidst wreathed turban folds of black drapery, vague in its character and consistency as cloud, gleamed a ring of white flame, gemmed with sparkles of a more lurid tinge.
<p/>This pale crescent was <div class="bookquote">``the likeness of a kingly crown;''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>what it diademed was <div class="bookquote">``the shape which shape had none.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Were you happy when you painted these pictures?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>asked Mr. Rochester presently.
<p/>'' I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy. To paint them, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.''
<p/>Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints.
<p/>``I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``That is not saying much. Did you sit at them long each day?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?''
<p/>I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise.
<p/>You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.
<p/>'' Far from it. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably. As to the thoughts, they are elfish.
<p/>These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream. How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant?
<p/>for the planet above quells their rays. And what meaning is that in their solemn depth? And who taught you to paint wind?
<p/>There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top. Where did you see Latmos? For that is Latmos.
<p/>There! put the drawings away! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had scarce tied the strings of the portfolio, when, looking at his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) watch, he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) said abruptly--
<p/>'' It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up so long? Take her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) to bed.
<p/>Adele went to kiss him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) before quitting the room: he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) endured the caress, but scarcely seemed to relish it more than Pilot would have done, nor so much.
<p/>I wish you all good-night, now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), making a movement of the hand towards the door, in token that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was tired of our company, and wished to dismiss us.
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax folded up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) knitting: I took my portfolio: we curtseyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), received a frigid bow in return, and so withdrew.
<p/>You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,'' I observed, when I rejoined her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) room, after putting Adele to bed.
<p/>``True: no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) manner, I never think of it; and then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Partly because it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) nature--and we can none of us help our nature; and partly because he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), and make his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) spirits unequal.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Well, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``I think so: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is very changeful and abrupt.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Why?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``What about?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Family troubles, for one thing.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has no family. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not now, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has had--or, at least, relatives.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) elder brother a few years since. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) elder brother?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes. The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property; only about nine years.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Nine years is a tolerable time. Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) so very fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) brother as to be still inconsolable for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) loss?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, no--perhaps not. I believe there were some misunderstandings between them. Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) prejudiced his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) father against him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.
<p/>Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) considered a painful position, for the sake of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) spirit could not brook what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had to suffer in it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is not very forgiving: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) broke with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) family, and now for many years he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has led an unsettled kind of life.
<p/>I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) brother without a will left him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) shuns the old place.
<p/>The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) shun it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I should have liked something clearer; but Mrs. Fairfax either could not, or would not, give me more explicit information of the origin and nature of Mr. Rochester's trials.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) thinks it gloomy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The answer was evasive. She (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) averred they were a mystery to herself, and that what she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) knew was chiefly from conjecture.
<p/>It was evident, indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wished me to drop the subject, which I did accordingly. CHAPTER XIV For several subsequent days I saw little of Mr. Rochester.
<p/>In the mornings he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) seemed much engaged with business, and, in the afternoon, gentlemen from Millcote or the neighbourhood called, and sometimes stayed to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sprain was well enough to admit of horse exercise, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) rode out a good deal; probably to return these visits, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) generally did not come back till late at night.
<p/>During this interval, even Adele was seldom sent for to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) presence, and all my acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was confined to an occasional rencontre in the hall, on the stairs, or in the gallery, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would sometimes pass me haughtily and coldly, just acknowledging my presence by a distant nod or a cool glance, and sometimes bow and smile with gentlemanlike affability.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) changes of mood did not offend me, because I saw that I had nothing to do with their alternation; the ebb and flow depended on causes quite disconnected with me.
<p/>One day he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had had company to dinner, and had sent for my portfolio; in order, doubtless, to exhibit its contents: the gentlemen went away early, to attend a public meeting at Millcote, as Mrs. Fairfax informed me; but the night being wet and inclement, Mr. Rochester did not accompany them.
<p/>I brushed Adele's hair and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) neat, and having ascertained that I was myself in my usual Quaker trim, where there was nothing to retouch--all being too close and plain, braided locks included, to admit of disarrangement--we descended, Adele wondering whether the petit coffre was at length come; for, owing to some mistake, its arrival had hitherto been delayed.
<p/>Soon after they were gone he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) rang the bell: a message came that I and Adele were to go downstairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was gratified: there it stood, a little carton, on the table when we entered the dining-room.
<p/>Yes, there is your `boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,'' said the deep and rather sarcastic voice of Mr. Rochester, proceeding from the depths of an immense easy-chair at the fireside.
<p/>And mind,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) appeared to know it by instinct. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Ma boite! ma boite! '' exclaimed she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), running towards it. '' '' ''
<p/>Adele seemed scarcely to need the warning--she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had already retired to a sofa with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) treasure, and was busy untying the cord which secured the lid.
<p/>Having removed this impediment, and lifted certain silvery envelopes of tissue paper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) merely exclaimed-- <div class="bookquote">``Oh ciel! Que c'est beau! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Eyre there?''  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>now demanded the master, half rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) seat to look round to the door, near which I still stood.
<p/>and then remained absorbed in ecstatic contemplation. '' Ah! well, come forward; be seated here. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) drew a chair near his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own.
<p/>I am not fond of the prattle of children,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) continued; <div class="bookquote">``for, old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening tete-a-tete with a brat. Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.
<p/>By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind; it won't do to neglect her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.
<p/>Confound these civilities! I continually forget them. Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) rang, and despatched an invitation to Mrs. Fairfax, who soon arrived, knitting-basket in hand.
<p/>I have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) presents, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) is bursting with repletion: have the goodness to serve her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) as auditress and interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed.
<p/>Adele, indeed, no sooner saw Mrs. Fairfax, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) summoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) sofa, and there quickly filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) lap with the porcelain, the ivory, the waxen contents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``boite;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>pouring out, meantime, explanations and raptures in such broken English as she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was mistress of.
<p/>Now I have performed the part of a good host,'' pursued Mr. Rochester, <div class="bookquote">``put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose. '' '' Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little farther forward: you are yet too far back
<p/>; I cannot see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no mind to do. ''
<p/>I did as I was bid, though I would much rather have remained somewhat in the shade; but Mr. Rochester had such a direct way of giving orders, it seemed a matter of course to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) promptly.
<p/>We were, as I have said, in the dining-room: the lustre, which had been lit for dinner, filled the room with a festal breadth of light; the large fire was all red and clear; the purple curtains hung rich and ample before the lofty window and loftier arch; everything was still, save the subdued chat of Adele -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) dared not speak loud-RRB-, and, filling up each pause, the beating of winter rain against the panes.
<p/>Mr. Rochester, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) damask-covered chair, looked different to what I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) look before; not quite so stern--much less gloomy.
<p/>There was a smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) lips, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eyes sparkled, whether with wine or not, I am not sure; but I think it very probable.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was, in short, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) after-dinner mood; more expanded and genial, and also more self- indulgent than the frigid and rigid temper of the morning; still he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) looked preciously grim, cushioning his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) massive head against the swelling back of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) chair, and receiving the light of the fire on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) granite- hewn features, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) great, dark eyes; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had great, dark eyes, and very fine eyes, too--not without a certain change in their depths sometimes, which, if it was not softness, reminded you, at least, of that feeling.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had been looking two minutes at the fire, and I had been looking the same length of time at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), when, turning suddenly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) caught my gaze fastened on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) physiognomy.
<p/>I should, if I had deliberated, have replied to this question by something conventionally vague and polite; but the answer somehow slipped from my tongue before I was aware--<div class="bookquote">``No, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>By my word! there is something singular about you,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``you have the air of a little nonnette ; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet -LRB-except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance-RRB-; and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You examine me, Miss Eyre,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``do you think me handsome? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Ah! What do you mean by it?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little consequence, or something of that sort.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You ought to have replied no such thing. Beauty of little consequence, indeed!
<p/>And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under my ear!
<p/>Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray? I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man?''
<p/>'' Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.'' <div class="bookquote">``Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) lifted up the sable waves of hair which lay horizontally over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) brow, and showed a solid enough mass of intellectual organs, but an abrupt deficiency where the suave sign of benevolence should have risen.
<p/>Criticise me: does my forehead not please you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Now, ma'am, am I a fool? '' <div class="bookquote">``Far from it, sir. You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Another stick of the penknife, when she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) pretended to pat my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of children and old women -LRB-low be it spoken!-RRB-.
<p/>No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>philanthropist</b></font>) pointed to the prominences which are said to indicate that faculty, and which, fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>philanthropist</b></font>), were sufficiently conspicuous; giving, indeed, a marked breadth to the upper part of his (<font color='blue'><b>philanthropist</b></font>) head: <div class="bookquote">``and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart.
<p/>When I was as old as you, I was a feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since
<p/>I am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>There again! : she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has even kneaded me with her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) knuckles, and now I flatter myself Yes: does that leave hope for me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Decidedly he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has had too much wine,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought; and I did not know what answer to make to his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) queer question: how could I tell whether he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was capable of being re-transformed?
<p/>You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hope of what, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?''  (<font color='red'><b>Young</b></font>)</div>'' Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.
<p/>With this announcement he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) rose from his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) chair, and stood, leaning his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) arm on the marble mantelpiece: in that attitude his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) shape was seen plainly as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) face; his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) unusual breadth of chest, disproportionate almost to his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) length of limb.
<p/>I am sure most people would have thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) an ugly man; yet there was so much unconscious pride in his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) port; so much ease in his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) demeanour; such a look of complete indifference to his (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) own external appearance; so haughty a reliance on the power of other qualities, intrinsic or adventitious, to atone for the lack of mere personal attractiveness, that, in looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>), one inevitably shared the indifference, and, even in a blind, imperfect sense, put faith in the confidence.
<p/>I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk.
<p/>Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.
<p/>I have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what pleases.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of you--therefore speak. '' Instead of speaking, I smiled; and not a very complacent or submissive smile either.
<p/>'' Speak,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) urged. '' What about, sir?'' ``Whatever you like. I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of treating it entirely to yourself.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``If he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off, he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) will find he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) has addressed himself to the wrong person,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought.
<p/>'' Accordingly I sat and said nothing: '' You are dumb, Miss Eyre. '' I was dumb still. He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) bent his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) head a little towards me, and with a single hasty glance seemed to dive into my eyes.
<p/>'' Stubborn? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and annoyed. Ah! it is consistent. I put my request in an absurd, almost insolent form.
<p/>The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an inferior: that is''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-correcting himself-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``I claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's advance in experience.
<p/>This is legitimate, et j'y tiens , as Adele would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a rusty nail.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) had deigned an explanation, almost an apology, and I did not feel insensible to his (<font color='blue'><b>nail</b></font>) condescension, and would not seem so.
<p/>I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?
<p/>Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Ask me questions, and I will do my best to answer them.'' ''
<p/>Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do as you please, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very evasive one.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.
<p/>But I won't allow that, seeing that it would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both advantages.
<p/>Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command.
<p/>Reply clearly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Humph! Promptly spoken. Will you? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I smiled: I thought to myself Mr. Rochester is peculiar--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) seems to forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) pays me 30 pounds per annum for receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) orders.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The smile is very well,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), catching instantly the passing expression; <div class="bookquote">``but speak too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Paid subordinates! What!
<p/>you are my paid subordinate, are you? Oh yes, I had forgotten the salary! Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree to let me hector a little?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his (<font color='blue'><b>subordinate</b></font>) dependency, I agree heartily.''
<p/>And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?''
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant.
<p/>However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.
<p/>But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it.
<p/>And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Humbug! Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have just done. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And so may you,'' I thought.
<p/>My eye met his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as the idea crossed my mind: he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) seemed to read the glance, answering as if its import had been spoken as well as imagined--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes, you are right,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I have plenty of faults of my own: I know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>God wot I envy you your peace of mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory. <div class="bookquote">``How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it to fetid puddle. I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.
<p/>Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you see I am not so.
<p/>You would say you don't see it; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye -LRB-beware, by-the-bye,
<p/>Then take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life.
<p/>what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language-RRB-. Do you wonder that I avow this to you?
<p/>Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.''
<p/>'' How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?'' <div class="bookquote">``I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary.
<p/>You would say, I should have been superior to circumstances; so I should-- so I should; but you see I was not.

<p/>When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool : I turned desperate; then I degenerated. I wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it, hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?
<p/>Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I will get it, cost what it may.''
<p/>``It is not its cure. <div class="bookquote">``Then you will degenerate still more, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?

<p/>It seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to which you might revert with pleasure.''

<p/>Don't trouble yourself to answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious.
<p/>The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.
<p/>I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high.
<p/>Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre? You are still bent on going?'' <div class="bookquote">``It has struck nine, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.
<p/>While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Adele -LRB-I have my own reasons for thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) a curious study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day-RRB-.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) pulled out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) unfolded it; coquetry runs in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) blood, blends with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) brains, and seasons the marrow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) bones. '
<p/>My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours observation. Il faut que je l'essaie!'
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a miniature of Celine Varens, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Varens</b></font>) used to appear on the boards at the rising of--
<p/>However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be realised.
<p/>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Varens</b></font>), `et a l'instant meme!' and she (<font color='blue'><b>Varens</b></font>) rushed out of the room. But never mind that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Adele</b></font>)</div>Ere long, Adele's little foot was heard tripping across the hall.
<p/>A dress of rose-coloured satin, very short, and as full in the skirt as it could be gathered, replaced the brown frock she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had previously worn; a wreath of rosebuds circled her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) forehead; her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) feet were dressed in silk stockings and small white satin sandals.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) entered, transformed as her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) guardian had predicted. '' Est-ce que ma robe va bien? '' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>), bounding forwards; ``et mes souliers?
<p/>And spreading out her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) dress, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) chasseed across the room till, having reached Mr. Rochester, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) wheeled lightly round before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) on tip-toe, then dropped on one knee at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) feet, exclaiming-- <div class="bookquote">``Monsieur, je vous

<p/>My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.
<p/>Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.
<p/>I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pre-cise-ly!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer; <div class="bookquote">``and, `comme cela,' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) charmed my English gold out of my British breeches' pocket. I'll explain all this some day.
<p/>It was one afternoon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) chanced to meet me and Adele in the grounds: and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) played with Pilot and her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) shuttlecock, he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) asked me to walk up and down a long beech avenue within sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) then said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was the daughter of a French opera-dancer, Celine Varens, towards whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) had once cherished what he (<font color='blue'><b>Roman</b></font>) called a ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>grande passion .
<p/>Good-night. '' CHAPTER XV Mr. Rochester did, on a future occasion, explain it. '' This passion Celine had professed to return with even superior ardour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) thought himself her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) idol, ugly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) believed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) preferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) '' taille d'athlete '' to the elegance of the Apollo Belvidere.
<p/>And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) British gnome, that I installed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) in an hotel; gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c.
<p/>I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre.
<p/>'' In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the received style, like any other spoony. I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other spoonies.
<p/>Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) presence.
<p/>No,--I exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>): it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity.
<p/>I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony.
<p/>The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one now, if you will excuse me.
<p/>Here ensued a pause, filled up by the producing and lighting of a cigar; having placed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips and breathed a trail of Havannah incense on the freezing and sunless air, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went on--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was croquant ---LRB-overlook the barbarism-RRB--- croquant chocolate comfits, and smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night
<p/>It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>, I recognised the `voiture' I had given Celine.
<p/>The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame -LRB-that is the very word for an opera inamorata-RRB- alighted:
<p/>though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) instantly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) dress, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) skipped from the carriage-step.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) was returning: of course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon. Bending over the balcony, I was about to murmur
<p/>`Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>); cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched porte cochere of the hotel.
<p/>'' You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre? Of course not: I need not ask you; because you never felt love.
<p/>You have both sentiments yet to experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it.
<p/>Floating on with closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.
<p/>But I tell you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer current--as I am now.
<p/>You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in which your youth has hitherto slid away. ''
<p/>I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost.
<p/>I like Thornfield, its antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great plague-house?
<p/>How I do still abhor--'' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ground his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) teeth and was silent: he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) arrested his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) step and struck his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) boot against the hard ground.
<p/>Some hated thought seemed to have him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) in its grip, and to hold him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) so tightly that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not advance.
<p/>We were ascending the avenue when he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) thus paused; the hall was before us. Lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eye to its battlements, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cast over them a glare such as I never saw before or since.
<p/>Pain, shame, ire, impatience, disgust, detestation, seemed momentarily to hold a quivering conflict in the large pupil dilating under his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) ebon eyebrow.
<p/>Wild was the wrestle which should be paramount; but another feeling rose and triumphed: something hard and cynical: self-willed and resolute:
<p/>it settled his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) passion and petrified his (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) countenance: he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) went on-- '' During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with my destiny.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres. '
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) said, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) finger; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) wrote in the air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, `Like it if you can!
<p/>You like Thornfield?' Like it if you dare!' '' 'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and'' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) subjoined moodily-RRB-
<p/>I wish to be a better man than I have been, than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem but straw and rotten wood.
<p/>'' I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness--yes, goodness. '' Adele here ran before him (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) shuttlecock.
<p/>Continuing then to pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) walk in silence, I ventured to recall him (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) to the point whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) had abruptly diverged--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Away!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) cried harshly; <div class="bookquote">``keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Did you leave the balcony, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked, <div class="bookquote">``when Mdlle.
<p/>I almost expected a rebuff for this hardly well-timed question, but, on the contrary, waking out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) scowling abstraction, he (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) eyes towards me, and the shade seemed to clear off his (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) brow.
<p/>When I saw my charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core.
<p/>Varens entered? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, I had forgotten Celine! Well, to resume. Strange! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Macbeth</b></font>) exclaimed, suddenly starting again from the point. ''
<p/>Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!
<p/>But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets.
<p/>Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection
<p/>: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one. Happily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.
<p/>The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me. '' After this digression he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) proceeded--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I remained in the balcony. ' They will come to her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) boudoir, no doubt,' thought I: `let me prepare an ambush.'
<p/>So putting my hand in through the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.
<p/>The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was `the Varens,' shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and
<p/>there was her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) for a young roue of a vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) so absolutely.
<p/>On recognising him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank under an extinguisher.
<p/>A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) deserved only scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) dupe.
<p/>My eye was quickly at the aperture. Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener.
<p/>Neither of them possessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) termed them.
<p/>Now it had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) called my ' beaute male :'
<p/>wherein she (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) differed diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me handsome.
<p/>A card of mine lay on the table; this being perceived, brought my name under discussion. The contrast struck me at the time and--
<p/>'' Adele here came running up again. '' Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to see you.''
<p/>Opening the window, I walked in upon them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) notice to vacate her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) hotel; offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Celine</b></font>) a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.
<p/>Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>); left a bullet in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>agent</b></font>) poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.
<p/>But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) may be, though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) countenance
<p/>Some years after I had broken with the mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) abandoned her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.
<p/>I acknowledged no natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) father; but hearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was quite destitute, I e`en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden.
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?
<p/>No: Adele is not answerable for either her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) mother's faults or yours: I have a regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>); and now that I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) is, in a sense, parentless--forsaken by her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) mother and disowned by you,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! in that case I must abridge. : Pilot is more like me than she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>). ''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>'' sir--I shall cling closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) than before.
<p/>How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) as a friend?''
<p/>'' Oh, that is the light in which you view it! Well, I must go in now; and you too: it darkens.
<p/>But I stayed out a few minutes longer with Adele and Pilot--ran a race with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>), and played a game of battledore and shuttlecock.
<p/>When we went in, and I had removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) bonnet and coat, I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) on my knee; kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) there an hour, allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) to prattle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) liked: not rebuking even some little freedoms and trivialities into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was apt to stray when much noticed, and which betrayed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) a superficiality of character, inherited probably from her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) mother, hardly congenial to an English mind.
<p/>'' Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) merits; and I was disposed to appreciate all that was good in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) to the utmost.
<p/>I sought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) countenance and features a likeness to Mr. Rochester, but found none: no trait, no turn of expression announced relationship.
<p/>It was a pity: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) could but have been proved to resemble him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would have thought more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>).
<p/>It was not till after I had withdrawn to my own chamber for the night, that I steadily reviewed the tale Mr. Rochester had told me.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had said, there was probably nothing at all extraordinary in the substance of the narrative itself: a wealthy Englishman's passion for a French dancer, and her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>) treachery to him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>), were every-day matters enough, no doubt, in society; but there was something decidedly strange in the paroxysm of emotion which had suddenly seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) was in the act of expressing the present contentment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) mood, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) newly revived pleasure in the old hall and its environs.
<p/>I meditated wonderingly on this incident; but gradually quitting it, as I found it for the present inexplicable, I turned to the consideration of my master's manner to myself.
<p/>The confidence he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had thought fit to repose in me seemed a tribute to my discretion: I regarded and accepted it as such.
<p/>I never seemed in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) way; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) did not take fits of chilling hauteur: when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) met me unexpectedly, the encounter seemed welcome; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had always a word and sometimes a smile for me: when summoned by formal invitation to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) presence, I was honoured by a cordiality of reception that made me feel I really possessed the power to amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and that these evening conferences were sought as much for his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) pleasure as for my benefit.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) deportment had now for some weeks been more uniform towards me than at the first. I, indeed, talked comparatively little, but I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) talk with relish.
<p/>It was his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) nature to be communicative; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) liked to open to a mind unacquainted with the world glimpses of its scenes and ways
<p/>-LRB-I do not mean its corrupt scenes and wicked ways, but such as derived their interest from the great scale on which they were acted, the strange novelty by which they were characterised-RRB-; and I had a keen delight in receiving the new ideas he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) offered, in imagining the new pictures he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) portrayed, and following him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in thought through the new regions he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) disclosed, never startled or troubled by one noxious allusion.
<p/>The ease of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) manner freed me from painful restraint: the friendly frankness, as correct as cordial, with which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) treated me, drew me to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>I felt at times as if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) were my relation rather than my master: yet he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was imperious sometimes still; but I did not mind that
<p/>So happy, so gratified did I become with this new interest added to life, that I ceased to pine after kindred:
<p/>my thin crescent-destiny seemed to enlarge; the blanks of existence were filled up; my bodily health improved; I gathered flesh and strength.
<p/>No, reader: gratitude, and many associations, all pleasurable and genial, made his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) face the object I best liked to see; his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.
<p/>; I saw it was his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) way. And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? Yet I had not forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) faults; indeed, I could not, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) brought them frequently before me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description: in my secret soul I knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) great kindness to me was balanced by unjust severity to many others.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was moody, too; unaccountably so; I more than once, when sent for to read to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), found him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) library alone, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) head bent on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) folded arms; and, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) looked up, a morose, almost a malignant, scowl blackened his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) features.
<p/>But I believed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) moodiness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) harshness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) former faults of morality -LRB-I say former , for now he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) seemed corrected of them-RRB- had their source in some cruel cross of fate.
<p/>I believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was naturally a man of better tendencies, higher principles, and purer tastes than such as circumstances had developed, education instilled, or destiny encouraged.
<p/>I thought there were excellent materials in him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); though for the present they hung together somewhat spoiled and tangled. I cannot deny that I grieved for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) grief, whatever that was, and would have given much to assuage it.
<p/>Though I had now extinguished my candle and was laid down in bed, I could not sleep for thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) look when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) paused in the avenue, and told how his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) destiny had risen up before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), and dared him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) to be happy at Thornfield.
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at a time; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has now been resident eight weeks.
<p/>'' Why not? '' I asked myself. '' What alienates him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) from the house? Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) leave it again soon? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) does go, the change will be doleful.
<p/>I hardly know whether I had slept or not after this musing; at any rate, I started wide awake on hearing a vague murmur, peculiar and lugubrious, which sounded, I thought, just above me.
<p/>Suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) should be absent spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem! '' I wished I had kept my candle burning: the night was drearily dark; my spirits were depressed.
<p/>I rose and sat up in bed, listening. The sound was hushed. I tried again to sleep; but my heart beat anxiously: my inward tranquillity was broken.
<p/>Just then it seemed my chamber-door was touched; as if fingers had swept the panels in groping a way along the dark gallery outside.
<p/>The clock, far down in the hall, struck two. I said, <div class="bookquote">``Who is there?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Nothing answered. I was chilled with fear.
<p/>All at once I remembered that it might be Pilot, who, when the kitchen- door chanced to be left open, not unfrequently found his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) way up to the threshold of Mr. Rochester's chamber: I had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) lying there myself in the mornings.
<p/>Silence composes the nerves; and as an unbroken hush now reigned again through the whole house, I began to feel the return of slumber.
<p/>The idea calmed me somewhat: I lay down. But it was not fated that I should sleep that night. A dream had scarcely approached my ear, when it fled affrighted, scared by a marrow-freezing incident enough.
<p/>The head of my bed was near the door, and I thought at first the goblin-laugher stood at my bedside--or rather, crouched by my pillow: but I rose, looked round, and could see nothing; while, as I still gazed, the unnatural sound was reiterated: and I knew it came from behind the panels.
<p/>This was a demoniac laugh--low, suppressed, and deep--uttered, as it seemed, at the very keyhole of my chamber door. My first impulse was to rise and fasten the bolt; my next, again to cry out, <div class="bookquote">``Who is there?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Ere long, steps retreated up the gallery towards the third-storey staircase: a door had lately been made to shut in that staircase; I heard it open and close, and all was still.
<p/>Something gurgled and moaned. '' Was that Grace Poole? and is she (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) possessed with a devil? '' thought I. Impossible now to remain longer by myself: I must go to Mrs. Fairfax.
<p/>I hurried on my frock and a shawl; I withdrew the bolt and opened the door with a trembling hand. There was a candle burning just outside, and on the matting in the gallery.
<p/>I was surprised at this circumstance: but still more was I amazed to perceive the air quite dim, as if filled with smoke; and, while looking to the right hand and left, to find whence these blue wreaths issued, I became further aware of a strong smell of burning.
<p/>Something creaked: it was a door ajar; and that door was Mr. Rochester's, and the smoke rushed in a cloud from thence.
<p/>I thought no more of Mrs. Fairfax; I thought no more of Grace Poole, or the laugh: in an instant, I was within the chamber.
<p/>Tongues of flame darted round the bed: the curtains were on fire. In the midst of blaze and vapour, Mr. Rochester lay stretched motionless, in deep sleep.
<p/>Not a moment could be lost: the very sheets were kindling, I rushed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) basin and ewer; fortunately, one was wide and the other deep, and both were filled with water.
<p/>I heaved them up, deluged the bed and its occupant, flew back to my own room, brought my own water-jug, baptized the couch afresh, and, by God's aid, succeeded in extinguishing the flames which were devouring it.
<p/>The hiss of the quenched element, the breakage of a pitcher which I flung from my hand when I had emptied it, and, above all, the splash of the shower-bath I had liberally bestowed, roused Mr. Rochester at last.
<p/>Though it was now dark, I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was awake; because I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) fulminating strange anathemas at finding himself lying in a pool of water.
<p/>'' Wake! wake! '' I cried. I shook him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) only murmured and turned: the smoke had stupefied him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). ''
<p/>No, sir,'' I answered; <div class="bookquote">``but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Is there a flood? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) cried. '' <div class="bookquote">``In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) demanded.
<p/>'' What have you done with me, witch, sorceress? Who is in the room besides you? Have you plotted to drown me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up. Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is.
<p/>I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two minutes till I get into some dry garments,
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``There! if any dry there be-- yes, here is my dressing-gown. Now run! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did run; I brought the candle which still remained in the gallery.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) took it from my hand, held it up, and surveyed the bed, all blackened and scorched, the sheets drenched, the carpet round swimming in water.
<p/>I briefly related to him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) what had transpired: the strange laugh I had heard in the gallery: the step ascending to the third storey; the smoke,--the smell of fire which had conducted me to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) room; in what state I had found matters there, and how I had deluged him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) with all the water I could lay hands on.
<p/>'' What is it? and who did it? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) asked. -LCB- <div class="bookquote">``What is it and who did it? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) asked: p140.jpg-RCB-
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) listened very gravely; his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) face, as I went on, expressed more concern than astonishment; he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) did not immediately speak when I had concluded.
<p/>'' Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax? '' I asked. '' Mrs. Fairfax? No; what the deuce would you call her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) for?
<p/>What can she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) do? Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) sleep unmolested.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wife. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all: just be still.
<p/>If you are not warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.
<p/>You have a shawl on. Now place your feet on the stool, to keep them out of the wet. I am going to leave you a few minutes.
<p/>I shall take the candle. Remain where you are till I return; be as still as a mouse. I must pay a visit to the second storey.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) passed up the gallery very softly, unclosed the staircase door with as little noise as possible, shut it after him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), and the last ray vanished.
<p/>Don't move, remember, or call any one. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went: I watched the light withdraw. I was left in total darkness.
<p/>: it was cold, in spite of the cloak; and then I did not see the use of staying, as I was not to rouse the house.
<p/>I was on the point of risking Mr. Rochester's displeasure by disobeying his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) orders, when the light once more gleamed dimly on the gallery wall, and I heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) unshod feet tread the matting.
<p/>I listened for some noise, but heard nothing. A very long time elapsed. I grew weary '' I hope it is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>),'' thought I, <div class="bookquote">``and not something worse.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) re-entered, pale and very gloomy. '' I have found it all out,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), setting his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) candle down on the washstand; ``it is as I thought.
<p/>At the end of a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) inquired in rather a peculiar tone-- <div class="bookquote">``I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber door.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) made no reply, but stood with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arms folded, looking on the ground. '' No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.''
<p/>'' But you heard an odd laugh? You have heard that laugh before, I should think, or something like it?'' ''
<p/>Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) laughs in that way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) is a singular person.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Just so. Grace Poole--you have guessed it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) is, as you say, singular--very. Well, I shall reflect on the subject.
<p/>Meantime, I am glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the precise details of to-night's incident. You are no talking fool: say nothing about it.
<p/>I will account for this state of affairs''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>-LRB-pointing to the bed-RRB-: <div class="bookquote">``and now return to your own room. I shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night.
<p/>It is near four:--in two hours the servants will be up.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good-night, then, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, departing. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) seemed surprised--very inconsistently so, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) had just told me to go.
<p/>But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``are you quitting me already, and in that way?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' You said I might go, sir.'' '' Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and excruciating death!
<p/>and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers! At least shake hands. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) hand; I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) mine: he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) took it first in one, them in both his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) own.
<p/>'' You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt. I cannot say more.
<p/>Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) paused; gazed at me: words almost visible trembled on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) lips,--but his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) voice was checked. '' Good-night again, sir.
<p/>There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, in the case. '' <div class="bookquote">``I knew,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``you would do me good in some way, at some time;--I

<p/>People talk of natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable. My cherished preserver, goodnight!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Strange energy was in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) voice, strange fire in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) look. '' I am glad I happened to be awake,'' I said: and then I was going.
<p/>'' What! you will go?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am cold, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Cold? Yes,--and standing in a pool! Go, then, Jane; go! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) still retained my hand, and I could not free it.
<p/>I bethought myself of an expedient. '' I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Well, leave me:''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) relaxed his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) fingers, and I was gone.
<p/>Till morning dawned I was tossed on a buoyant but unquiet sea, where billows of trouble rolled under surges of joy.
<p/>I thought sometimes I saw beyond its wild waters a shore, sweet as the hills of Beulah; and now and then a freshening gale, wakened by hope, bore my spirit triumphantly towards the bourne: but I could not reach it, even in fancy--a counteracting breeze blew off land, and continually drove me back.
<p/>I regained my couch, but never thought of sleep. Sense would resist delirium: judgment would warn passion. Too feverish to rest, I rose as soon as day dawned.
<p/>I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) voice again, yet feared to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) eye.
<p/>During the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) coming; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was sure to visit it that day.
<p/>But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adele's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's voice, and Leah's, and the cook's--that is, John's wife--and even John's own gruff tones.
<p/>CHAPTER XVI There were exclamations of <div class="bookquote">``What a mercy master was not burnt in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bed!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``How providential that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) waked nobody!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is to be hoped he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>&c.
<p/>To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings.
<p/>I was about to address her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber--a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains.
<p/>Leah stood up in the window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. That woman was no other than Grace Poole.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was intent on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) work, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hard forehead, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) commonplace features, was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended victim had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) last night to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) lair, and -LRB-as I believed-RRB-, charged her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with the crime she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished to perpetrate.
<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brown stuff gown, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. I was amazed--confounded.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked up, while I still gazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): no start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Miss,''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape, went on with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sewing.
<p/>'' I will put her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to some test,'' thought I: <div class="bookquote">``such absolute impenetrability is past comprehension. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Good morning, Grace,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Only master had been reading in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) bed last night; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) fell asleep with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench the flames with the water in the ewer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Has anything happened here? I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago. '' <div class="bookquote">``A strange affair!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, in a low voice: then, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) fixedly--``Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody? Did no one hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) move?
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) seemed to examine me warily; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) answered-- ``The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely to hear.
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but Mrs. Fairfax said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep heavy.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone--<div class="bookquote">``But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, dropping my voice, so that Leah, who was still polishing the panes, could not hear me, <div class="bookquote">``and at first I thought it was Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) again raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) eyes to me, and this time there was something of consciousness in their expression. '' ''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) took a new needleful of thread, waxed it carefully, threaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) needle with a steady hand, and then observed, with perfect composure--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was in such danger: You must have been dreaming.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was not dreaming,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, with some warmth, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) brazen coolness provoked me. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) looked at me; and with the same scrutinising and conscious eye.
<p/>'' Have you told master that you heard a laugh? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) inquired. '' I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) this morning.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) further asked. She (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) appeared to be cross-questioning me, attempting to draw from me information unawares.
<p/>The idea struck me that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) discovered I knew or suspected her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) guilt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) would be playing of some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) malignant pranks on me; I thought it advisable to be on my guard.
<p/>'' On the contrary,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``I bolted my door.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fiend! she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) wants to know my habits, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) may lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) plans accordingly! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied sharply, <div class="bookquote">``Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt
<p/>I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and I laid marked stress on the words-RRB-
<p/>: I did not think it necessary. <div class="bookquote">``I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``It will be wise so to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) answer: <div class="bookquote">``this neighbourhood is as quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.
<p/>And you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived here much; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) does come, being a bachelor, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) needs little waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about.
<p/>A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means, though He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) often blesses them when they are used discreetly.
<p/>I still stood absolutely dumfoundered at what appeared to me her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) miraculous self-possession and most inscrutable hypocrisy, when the cook entered.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And here she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) harangue: a long one for her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress. ''
<p/>Mrs. Poole,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>), addressing Grace, <div class="bookquote">``the servants' dinner will soon be ready: will you come down?''  (<font color='red'><b>Grace Poole/Grace</b></font>)</div>'' No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll carry it upstairs.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You'll have some meat?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And the sago?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll make it myself.
<p/>I hardly heard Mrs. Fairfax's account of the curtain conflagration during dinner, so much was I occupied in puzzling my brains over the enigmatical character of Grace Poole, and still more in pondering the problem of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) position at Thornfield and questioning why she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) had not been given into custody that morning, or, at the very least, dismissed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) master's service.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had almost as much as declared his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) from accusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>)?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>The cook</b></font>)</div>The cook here turned to me, saying that Mrs. Fairfax was waiting for me: so I departed. Why had he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) enjoined me, too, to secrecy?
<p/>It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dependants; so much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) power, that even when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) hand against his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) dared not openly charge her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) with the attempt, much less punish her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) for it.
<p/>Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) was, the idea could not be admitted.
<p/>Yet,'' I reflected, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) has been young once; her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) youth would be contemporary with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had lived here many years.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I don't think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.
<p/>What if a former caprice -LRB-a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>)-RRB- has delivered him (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) power, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) now exercises over his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) actions a secret influence, the result of his (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) own indiscretion, which he (<font color='blue'><b>freak</b></font>) cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?
<p/>But, having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind's eye, that I thought, <div class="bookquote">``No; impossible!
<p/>Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>my supposition cannot be correct.
<p/>Yet,'' suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, <div class="bookquote">``you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did; and last night--remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) words; remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) look; remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) voice!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I well remembered all; language, glance, and tone seemed at the moment vividly renewed. I was now in the schoolroom; Adele was drawing; I bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) and directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) pencil.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) looked up with a sort of start. '' Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle? '' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>). '' Vos doigts tremblent comme la feuille
<p/>, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!'' <div class="bookquote">``I am hot, Adele, with stooping! ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) went on sketching; I went on thinking.
<p/>I hastened to drive from my mind the hateful notion I had been conceiving respecting Grace Poole; it disgusted me. I compared myself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>), and found we were different.
<p/>And now I looked much better than I did when Bessie saw me; I had more colour and more flesh, more life, more vivacity, because I had brighter hopes and keener enjoyments.
<p/>Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Leaven</b></font>) spoke truth--I was a lady. '' Evening approaches,'' said I, as I looked towards the window.
<p/>I have never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely I shall see him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impatient.
<p/>When dusk actually closed, and when Adele left me to go and play in the nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it.
<p/>'' '' I listened for the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I fancied
<p/>sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). The door remained shut; darkness only came in through the window.
<p/>Still it was not late; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six.
<p/>I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would answer; I wanted to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) plainly if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) really believed it was she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) who had made last night's hideous attempt; and if so, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) wickedness a secret.
<p/>It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill.
<p/>Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my station, I could still meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) in argument without fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) and me.
<p/>Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many things to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)! A tread creaked on the stairs at last.
<p/>Leah made her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) appearance; but it was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room. Thither I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.
<p/>'' You must want your tea,'' said the good lady, as I joined her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``you ate so little at dinner. I am afraid,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``you are not well to- day: you look flushed and feverish.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the teapot while I knit off this needle?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Having completed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) task, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rose to draw down the blind, which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had hitherto kept up, by way, I suppose, of making the most of daylight, though dusk was now fast deepening into total obscurity.
<p/>It is fair to-night,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) looked through the panes, <div class="bookquote">``though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) journey.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Oh, quite well! I never felt better.'' '' '' '' Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere? I did not know he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was out.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) set off the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had breakfasted! He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is gone to the Leas, Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.
<p/>I believe there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and others. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) back to-night?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) is very likely to stay a week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.
<p/>Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is a general favourite
<p/>: the ladies are very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); though you would not think his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) appearance calculated to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) particularly in their eyes: but I suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) acquirements and abilities, perhaps his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.
<p/>There are Mrs. Eshton and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) three daughters--very elegant young ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most beautiful women
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Are there ladies at the Leas?''  (<font color='red'><b>women</b></font>)</div>'' , I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven years since, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) was a girl of eighteen.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) came here to a Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should have seen the dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit up!
<p/>I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of the evening.''
<p/>The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to hear some of the ladies sing and play.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>), you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) like?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>). Mr. Rochester would have me to come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.
<p/>I never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) jewels.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest curls I ever saw.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) shoulder and across her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) knee.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) like?'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) hair: it contrasted well with the jetty mass of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) curls.''
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was greatly admired, of course?'' '' Yes, indeed: and not only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) beauty, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) accomplishments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) on the piano.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) and Mr. Rochester sang a duet. '' <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Rochester? I was not aware he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) could sing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A very rich and powerful one: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) sang delightfully; it was a treat to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>);--and
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) played afterwards. I am no judge of music, but Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) say her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) execution was remarkably good.''
 (<font color='red'><b>this lady</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not yet married?'' <div class="bookquote">``It appears not: I fancy neither she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nor her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) sister have very large fortunes.
<p/>Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the eldest son came in for everything almost.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): Mr. Rochester, for instance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is rich, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) not?'' '' Oh! yes. But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr. Rochester is nearly forty; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is but twenty-five.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What of that? More unequal matches are made every day.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea of the sort.
<p/>But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you began tea.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No: I am too thirsty to eat. Will you let me have another cup?
<p/>I was about again to revert to the probability of a union between Mr. Rochester and the beautiful Blanche; but Adele came in, and the conversation was turned into another channel.
<p/>When once more alone, I reviewed the information I had got; looked into my heart, examined its thoughts and feelings, and endeavoured to bring back with a strict hand such as had been straying through imagination's boundless and trackless waste, into the safe fold of common sense.
<p/>Arraigned at my own bar, Memory having given her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) evidence of the hopes, wishes, sentiments I had been cherishing since last night--of the general state of mind in which I had indulged for nearly a fortnight past; Reason having come forward and told, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) own quiet way a plain, unvarnished tale, showing how I had rejected the real, and rabidly devoured the ideal;--I pronounced judgment to this effect:-- That a greater fool than Jane Eyre had never breathed the breath of life; that a more fantastic idiot had never surfeited herself on sweet lies, and swallowed poison as if it were nectar.
<p/>'' '' You ,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``a favourite with Mr. Rochester? You gifted with the power of pleasing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)? You of importance to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) in any way?
<p/>And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the world to a dependent and a novice.
<p/>Go! your folly sickens me. How dared you? Poor stupid dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and be ashamed!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>) said something in praise of your eyes, did he (<font color='blue'><b>novice</b></font>)? Blind puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed senselessness!
<p/>It does good to no woman to be flattered by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, ignis-fatuus
<p/>Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity; write under it, `Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.'
<p/>Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental
<p/>-like, into miry wilds whence there is no extrication. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' eye;--What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model! Order!
<p/>Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it `Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.'
<p/>Mr. Rochester thinks well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, `Mr. Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) chose to strive for it; is it likely he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would waste a serious thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian?'''
<p/>No snivel!--no sentiment!--no regret! I will endure only sense and resolution. '' Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy <div class="bookquote">``I'll do it,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I resolved: and having framed this determination, I grew calm, and fell asleep.
<p/>An hour or two sufficed to sketch my own portrait in crayons; and in less than a fortnight I had completed an ivory miniature of an imaginary Blanche Ingram.
<p/>It looked a lovely face enough, and when compared with the real head in chalk, the contrast was as great as self- control could desire.
<p/>I derived benefit from the task: it had kept my head and hands employed, and had given force and fixedness to the new impressions I wished to stamp indelibly on my heart.
<p/>Ere long, I had reason to congratulate myself on the course of wholesome discipline to which I had thus forced my feelings to submit.
<p/>Thanks to it, I was able to meet subsequent occurrences with a decent calm, which, had they found me unprepared, I should probably have been unequal to maintain, even externally.
<p/>I kept my word. CHAPTER XVII A week passed, and no news arrived of Mr. Rochester: ten days, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did not come.
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) should not be surprised if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) were to go straight from the Leas to London, and thence to the Continent, and not show his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) face again at Thornfield for a year to come; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had not unfrequently quitted it in a manner quite as abrupt and unexpected.
<p/>I was actually permitting myself to experience a sickening sense of disappointment; but rallying my wits, and recollecting my principles, I at once called my sensations to order; and it was wonderful how I got over the temporary blunder--
<p/>how I cleared up the mistake of supposing Mr. Rochester's movements a matter in which I had any cause to take a vital interest.
<p/>When I heard this, I was beginning to feel a strange chill and failing at the heart. Not that I humbled myself by a slavish notion of inferiority: on the contrary, I just said--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to receive the salary he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gives you for teaching his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) protegee, and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, you have a right to expect at his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hands.
<p/>Be sure that is the only tie he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) seriously acknowledges between you and him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); so don't make him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised.
<p/>I went on with my day's business tranquilly; but ever and anon vague suggestions kept wandering across my brain of reasons why I should quit Thornfield; and I kept involuntarily framing advertisements and pondering conjectures about new situations: these thoughts I did not think to check; they might germinate and bear fruit if they could.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Mr. Rochester had been absent upwards of a fortnight, when the post brought Mrs. Fairfax a letter. '' It is from the master,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>anon</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>anon</b></font>) looked at the direction.
<p/>'' Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) return or not. '' And while she (<font color='blue'><b>anon</b></font>) broke the seal and perused the document, I went on taking my coffee -LRB-we were at breakfast-RRB-
<p/>Why my hand shook, and why I involuntarily spilt half the contents of my cup into my saucer, I did not choose to consider.
<p/>Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being busy enough now: for a little while at least,'' said Mrs. Fairfax, still holding the note before her (<font color='blue'><b>anon</b></font>) spectacles.
<p/>Ere I permitted myself to request an explanation, I tied the string of Adele's pinafore, which happened to be loose: having helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) also to another bun and refilled her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) mug with milk, I said,
<p/>: it was hot, and I attributed to that circumstance a fiery glow which suddenly rose to my face. '' nonchalantly--
<p/>'' Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?'' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is--in three days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone either.
<p/>I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fairfax</b></font>)</div>And Mrs. Fairfax swallowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) breakfast and hastened away to commence operations. The three days were, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had foretold, busy enough.
<p/>Three women were got to help; and such scrubbing, such brushing, such washing of paint and beating of carpets, such taking down and putting up of pictures, such polishing of mirrors and lustres, such lighting of fires in bedrooms, such airing of sheets and feather-beds on hearths, I never beheld, either before or since.
<p/>Adele ran quite wild in the midst of it: the preparations for company and the prospect of their arrival, seemed to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) into ecstasies.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) would have Sophie to look over all her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``toilettes,''  (<font color='red'><b>Sophie</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) called frocks; to furbish up any that were '' passees ,'' and to air and arrange the new.
<p/>For herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) did nothing but caper about in the front chambers, jump on and off the bedsteads, and lie on the mattresses and piled-up bolsters and pillows before the enormous fires roaring in the chimneys.
<p/>From school duties she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) was exonerated: Mrs. Fairfax had pressed me into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) service, and I was all day in the storeroom, helping -LRB-or hindering-RRB- her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) and the cook; learning to make custards and cheese-cakes and French pastry, to truss game and garnish desert-dishes.
<p/>I had thought all the rooms at Thornfield beautifully clean and well arranged; but it appears I was mistaken. The party were expected to arrive on Thursday afternoon, in time for dinner at six.
<p/>During the intervening period I had no time to nurse chimeras; and I believe I was as active and gay as anybody--
<p/>Still, now and then, I received a damping check to my cheerfulness; and was, in spite of myself, thrown back on the region of doubts and portents, and dark conjectures.
<p/>This was when I chanced to see the third-storey staircase door -LRB-which of late had always been kept locked-RRB- open slowly, and give passage to the form of Grace Poole, in prim cap, white apron, and handkerchief; when I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) glide along the gallery, her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) quiet tread muffled in a list slipper; when I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) look into the bustling, topsy-turvy bedrooms,--just say a word, perhaps, to the charwoman about the proper way to polish a grate, or clean a marble mantelpiece, or take stains from papered walls, and then pass on.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) would thus descend to the kitchen once a day, eat her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) dinner, smoke a moderate pipe on the hearth, and go back, carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) pot of porter with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) private solace, in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) own gloomy, upper haunt.
<p/>Only one hour in the twenty-four did she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) pass with her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) fellow-servants below; all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) time was spent in some low-ceiled, oaken chamber of the second storey: there she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) sat and sewed--and probably laughed drearily to herself,--as companionless as a prisoner in his (<font color='blue'><b>prisoner</b></font>) dungeon.
<p/>The strangest thing of all was, that not a soul in the house, except me, noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) habits, or seemed to marvel at them:
<p/>I once, indeed, overheard part of a dialogue between Leah and one of the charwomen, of which Grace formed the subject.
<p/>Adele excepted. no one discussed her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) position or employment; no one pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) solitude or isolation. Leah had been saying something I had not caught, and the charwoman remarked--
<p/>Yes,'' said Leah; ``I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) gets good wages, I guess?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' And she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) is laying by: she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote.
<p/>I should not wonder but she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) has saved enough to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) independent if she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) liked to leave; but I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>)'s got used to the place; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>)'s not forty yet, and strong and able for anything.
<p/>It is too soon for her (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) to give up business.'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) is a good hand, I daresay,''  (<font color='red'><b>the charwoman</b></font>)</div>said the charwoman. ''
<p/>Ah!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) understands what she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) has to do,--nobody better,'' rejoined Leah significantly; <div class="bookquote">``and it is not every one could fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) shoes--not for all the money she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) gets.
<p/>I wonder whether the master--''  (<font color='red'><b>Leah</b></font>)</div>The charwoman was going on; but here Leah turned and perceived me, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) instantly gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) companion a nudge.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``That it is not! ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply. '' '' Doesn't she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) know? '' I heard the woman whisper. Leah shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) head, and the conversation was of course dropped.
<p/>All I had gathered from it amounted to this,--that there was a mystery at Thornfield; and that from participation in that mystery I was purposely excluded.
<p/>Thursday came: all work had been completed the previous evening; carpets were laid down, bed-hangings festooned, radiant white counterpanes spread, toilet tables arranged, furniture rubbed, flowers piled in vases: both chambers and saloons looked as fresh and bright as hands could make them.
<p/>The hall, too, was scoured; and the great carved clock, as well as the steps and banisters of the staircase, were polished to the brightness of glass; in the dining-room, the sideboard flashed resplendent with plate; in the drawing-room and boudoir, vases of exotics bloomed on all sides.
<p/>Afternoon arrived: Mrs. Fairfax assumed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) best black satin gown, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) gloves, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) gold watch; for it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) part to receive the company,--to conduct the ladies to their rooms, &
<p/>c. Adele, too, would be dressed: though I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had little chance of being introduced to the party that day at least.
<p/>For myself, I had no need to make any change; I should not be called upon to quit my sanctum of the schoolroom; for a sanctum it was now become to me,--<div class="bookquote">``a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.
<p/>It had been a mild, serene spring day--one of those days which, towards the end of March or the beginning of April, rise shining over the earth as heralds of summer.
<p/>It was drawing to an end now; but the evening was even warm, and I sat at work in the schoolroom with the window open.
<p/>However, to please her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), I allowed Sophie to apparel her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) short, full muslin frocks. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' It gets late,'' said Mrs. Fairfax, entering in rustling state.
<p/>'' I am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for it is past six now.
<p/>I have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the road : one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) went to the window. '' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is!'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>). '' Well, John'' -LRB-leaning out-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``any news?''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>'' They're coming, ma'am,'' was the answer.
<p/>I followed, taking care to stand on one side, so that, screened by the curtain, I could see without being seen.
<p/>The ten minutes John had given seemed very long, but at last wheels were heard; four equestrians galloped up the drive, and after them came two open carriages.
<p/>Fluttering veils and waving plumes filled the vehicles; two of the cavaliers were young, dashing-looking gentlemen; the third was Mr. Rochester, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) black horse, Mesrour, Pilot bounding before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) side rode a lady, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) were the first of the party.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) purple riding-habit almost swept the ground, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) veil streamed long on the breeze; mingling with its transparent folds, and gleaming through them, shone rich raven ringlets.
<p/>'' They'll be here in ten minutes. '' Adele flew to the window. '' Miss Ingram!'' exclaimed Mrs. Fairfax, and away she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) hurried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) post below.
<p/>The cavalcade, following the sweep of the drive, quickly turned the angle of the house, and I lost sight of it.
<p/>Adele now petitioned to go down; but I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) on my knee, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) to understand that she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) must not on any account think of venturing in sight of the ladies, either now or at any other time, unless expressly sent for: that Mr. Rochester would be very angry, &
<p/>Some natural tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) shed'' on being told this; but as I began to look very grave, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) consented at last to wipe them.
<p/>A joyous stir was now audible in the hall: gentlemen's deep tones and ladies' silvery accents blent harmoniously together, and distinguishable above all, though not loud, was the sonorous voice of the master of Thornfield Hall, welcoming his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) fair and gallant guests under its roof.
<p/>Then light steps ascended the stairs; and there was a tripping through the gallery, and soft cheerful laughs, and opening and closing doors, and, for a time, a hush.
<p/>c. '' '' Elles changent de toilettes,'' said Adele; who, listening attentively, had followed every movement; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) sighed. '' Chez maman,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>),
<p/>avait du monde, je le suivais partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``quand il y et c`etait si amusant: comme cela on apprend. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Don't you feel hungry, Adele?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures
<p/>que nous n'avons pas mange. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and get you something to eat.
<p/>All in that region was fire and commotion; the soup and fish were in the last stage of projection, and the cook hung over her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) crucibles in a frame of mind and body threatening spontaneous combustion.
<p/>In the servants' hall two coachmen and three gentlemen's gentlemen stood or sat round the fire; the abigails, I suppose, were upstairs with their mistresses; the new servants, that had been hired from Millcote, were bustling about everywhere.
<p/>Threading this chaos, I at last reached the larder; there I took possession of a cold chicken, a roll of bread, some tarts, a plate or two and a knife and fork: with this booty I made a hasty retreat.
<p/>I had regained the gallery, and was just shutting the back-door behind me, when an accelerated hum warned me that the ladies were about to issue from their chambers.
<p/>I could not proceed to the schoolroom without passing some of their doors, and running the risk of being surprised with my cargo of victualage; so I stood still at this end, which, being windowless, was dark: quite dark now, for the sun was set and twilight gathering.
<p/>Presently the chambers gave up their fair tenants one after another: each came out gaily and airily, with dress that gleamed lustrous through the dusk.
<p/>For a moment they stood grouped together at the other extremity of the gallery, conversing in a key of sweet subdued vivacity: they then descended the staircase almost as noiselessly as a bright mist rolls down a hill.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And issuing from my asylum with precaution, I sought a back-stairs which conducted directly to the kitchen. Their collective appearance had left on me an impression of high- born elegance, such as I had never before received.
<p/>I found Adele peeping through the schoolroom door, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) held ajar. '' What beautiful ladies!'' cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) in English. ''
<p/>Oh, I wish I might go to them! Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after dinner?'' ''
<p/>No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about. Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here is your dinner.
<p/>It was well I secured this forage, or both she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>), I, and Sophie, to whom I conveyed a share of our repast, would have run a chance of getting no dinner at all: every one downstairs was too much engaged to think of us.
<p/>The dessert was not carried out till after nine and at ten footmen were still running to and fro with trays and coffee- cups.
<p/>I allowed Adele to sit up much later than usual; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) could not possibly go to sleep while the doors kept opening and shutting below, and people bustling about.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was really hungry, so the chicken and tarts served to divert her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) attention for a time. Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) added, a message might possibly come from Mr. Rochester when she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was undressed; <div class="bookquote">``et alors quel dommage!
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) stories as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) would listen to them; and then for a change I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) out into the gallery.
<p/>The hall lamp was now lit, and it amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) to look over the balustrade and watch the servants passing backwards and forwards.
<p/>When the evening was far advanced, a sound of music issued from the drawing-room, whither the piano had been removed; Adele and I sat down on the top step of the stairs to listen.
<p/>Presently a voice blent with the rich tones of the instrument; it was a lady who sang, and very sweet her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) notes were.
<p/>I listened long: suddenly I discovered that my ear was wholly intent on analysing the mingled sounds, and trying to discriminate amidst the confusion of accents those of Mr. Rochester; and when it caught them, which it soon did, it found a further task in framing the tones, rendered by distance inarticulate, into words.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The solo over, a duet followed, and then a glee: a joyous conversational murmur filled up the intervals. The clock struck eleven.
<p/>I looked at Adele, whose head leant against my shoulder; her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) eyes were waxing heavy, so I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) up in my arms and carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) off to bed.
<p/>The next day was as fine as its predecessor: it was devoted by the party to an excursion to some site in the neighbourhood.
<p/>They set out early in the forenoon, some on horseback, the rest in carriages; I witnessed both the departure and the return.
<p/>Miss Ingram, as before, was the only lady equestrian; and, as before, Mr. Rochester galloped at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) side; the two rode a little apart from the rest.
<p/>I pointed out this circumstance to Mrs. Fairfax, who was standing at the window with me-- <div class="bookquote">``You said it was not likely they should think of being married,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) to any of the other ladies.
<p/>It was near one before the gentlemen and ladies sought their chambers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, I daresay: no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) admires her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>),'' I added; <div class="bookquote">``look how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) leans her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) head towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) face; I have never had a glimpse of it yet.
<p/>I happened to remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the ladies, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said: `Oh! let her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) come into the drawing-room after dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>).'''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``You will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Fairfax</b></font>)</div>answered Mrs. Fairfax. '' '' Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,'' I answered.
<p/>Well, I observed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) that as you were unused to company, I did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) replied, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) quick way--`Nonsense!
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) objects, tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) it is my particular wish; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) resists, say I shall come and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) in case of contumacy.'''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I will not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) that trouble,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. '' I will go, if no better may be; but I don't like it.
<p/>I'll tell you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is the most disagreeable part of the business.
<p/>You must go into the drawing- room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away--nobody will notice you.''
<p/>Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?'' '' No; I pleaded off, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) admitted my plea. <div class="bookquote">``Will these people remain long, do you think?''
 (<font color='red'><b>George Lynn/Lynn/George</b></font>)</div><p/>After the Easter recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will have to go up to town and take his (<font color='blue'><b>member</b></font>) seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): it surprises me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield.
<p/>It was with some trepidation that I perceived the hour approach when I was to repair with my charge to the drawing-room.
<p/>Adele had been in a state of ecstasy all day, after hearing she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was to be presented to the ladies in the evening; and it was not till Sophie commenced the operation of dressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) sobered down.
<p/>Then the importance of the process quickly steadied her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>), and by the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) curls arranged in well-smoothed, drooping clusters, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) pink satin frock put on, her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) long sash tied, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) lace mittens adjusted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) looked as grave as any judge.
<p/>No need to warn her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) not to disarrange her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) attire: when she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) was dressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) sat demurely down in her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) little chair, taking care previously to lift up the satin skirt for fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) should crease it, and assured me she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) would not stir thence till I was ready.
<p/>I quickly was: my best dress -LRB-the silver-grey one, purchased for Miss Temple's wedding, and never worn since-RRB- was soon put on; my hair was soon smoothed; my sole ornament, the pearl brooch, soon assumed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This We descended. Fortunately there was another entrance to the drawing-room than that through the saloon where they were all seated at dinner.
<p/>We found the apartment vacant; a large fire burning silently on the marble hearth, and wax candles shining in bright solitude, amid the exquisite flowers with which the tables were adorned.
<p/>The crimson curtain hung before the arch: slight as was the separation this drapery formed from the party in the adjoining saloon, they spoke in so low a key that nothing of their conversation could be distinguished beyond a soothing murmur.
<p/>Adele, who appeared to be still under the influence of a most solemnising impression, sat down, without a word, on the footstool I pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>).
<p/>I retired to a window-seat, and taking a book from a table near, endeavoured to read. Adele brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) stool to my feet; ere long she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) touched my knee.
<p/>'' What is it, Adele?'' '' Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques, mademoiselle? Seulement pour completer ma toilette.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You think too much of your `toilette,' Adele: but you may have a flower. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I took a rose from a vase and fastened it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) sash.
<p/>I turned my face away to conceal a smile I could not suppress: there was something ludicrous as well as painful in the little Parisienne's earnest and innate devotion to matters of dress.
<p/>A soft sound of rising now became audible; the curtain was swept back from the arch; through it appeared the dining-room, with its lit lustre pouring down light on the silver and glass of a magnificent dessert-service covering a long table; a band of ladies stood in the opening; they entered, and the curtain fell behind them.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) sighed a sigh of ineffable satisfaction, as if her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) cup of happiness were now full. There were but eight; yet, somehow, as they flocked in, they gave the impression of a much larger number.
<p/>Some of them were very tall; many were dressed in white; and all had a sweeping amplitude of array that seemed to magnify their persons as a mist magnifies the moon.
<p/>They dispersed about the room, reminding me, by the lightness and buoyancy of their movements, of a flock of white plumy birds.
<p/>I rose and curtseyed to them: one or two bent their heads in return, the others only stared at me. Some of them threw themselves in half-reclining positions on the sofas and ottomans:
<p/>some bent over the tables and examined the flowers and books: the rest gathered in a group round the fire: all talked in a low but clear tone which seemed habitual to them.
<p/>I knew their names afterwards, and may as well mention them now. First, there was Mrs. Eshton and two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) daughters.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) had evidently been a handsome woman, and was well preserved still. Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) daughters, the eldest, Amy, was rather little: naive, and child-like in face and manner, and piquant in form;
<p/>The second, Louisa, was taller and more elegant in figure; with a very pretty face, of that order the French term minois chiffone : both sisters were fair as lilies.
<p/>Lady Lynn was a large and stout personage of about forty, very erect, very haughty-looking, richly dressed in a satin robe of changeful sheen: her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynn</b></font>) dark hair shone glossily under the shade of an azure plume, and within the circlet of a band of gems.
<p/>her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynn</b></font>) white muslin dress and blue sash became her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynn</b></font>) well. Mrs. Colonel Dent was less showy; but, I thought, more lady-like.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) black satin dress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) scarf of rich foreign lace, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) pearl ornaments, pleased me better than the rainbow radiance of the titled dame.
<p/>But the three most distinguished--partly, perhaps, because the tallest figures of the band--were the Dowager Lady Ingram and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) daughters, Blanche and Mary.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had a slight figure, a pale, gentle face, and fair hair. They were all three of the loftiest stature of women.
<p/>The Dowager might be between forty and fifty: her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) shape was still fine; her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) hair -LRB-by candle-light at least-RRB- still black; her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) teeth, too, were still apparently perfect.
<p/>Most people would have termed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) a splendid woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) age: and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was, no doubt, physically speaking; but then there was an expression of almost insupportable haughtiness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) bearing and countenance.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had Roman features and a double chin, disappearing into a throat like a pillar: these features appeared to me not only inflated and darkened, but even furrowed with pride; and the chin was sustained by the same principle, in a position of almost preternatural erectness.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had, likewise, a fierce and a hard eye: it reminded me of Mrs. Reed's; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) mouthed her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) words in speaking; her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) voice was deep, its inflections very pompous, very dogmatical,--very intolerable, in short.
<p/>A crimson velvet robe, and a shawl turban of some gold-wrought Indian fabric, invested her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) -LRB-I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) thought-RRB- with a truly imperial dignity.
<p/>Blanche and Mary were of equal stature,--straight and tall as poplars. Mary was too slim for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) height, but Blanche was moulded like a Dian.
<p/>First, I wished to see whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) appearance accorded with Mrs. Fairfax's description; secondly, whether it at all resembled the fancy miniature I had painted of her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>); and thirdly--it will out!--whether it were such as I should fancy likely to suit Mr. Rochester's taste.
<p/>I regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>), of course, with special interest. As far as person went, she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) answered point for point, both to my picture and Mrs. Fairfax's description.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) face was like her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) mother's; a youthful unfurrowed likeness: the same low brow, the same high features, the same pride.
<p/>The noble bust, the sloping shoulders, the graceful neck, the dark eyes and black ringlets were all there;--but her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) face? It was not, however, so saturnine a pride!
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) laughed continually; her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) laugh was satirical, and so was the habitual expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) arched and haughty lip. Genius is said to be self-conscious.
<p/>I cannot tell whether Miss Ingram was a genius, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was self-conscious--remarkably self-conscious indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) entered into a discourse on botany with the gentle Mrs. Dent.
<p/>It seemed Mrs. Dent had not studied that science: though, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) liked flowers, <div class="bookquote">``especially wild ones;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Miss Ingram had, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) ran over its vocabulary with an air.
<p/>I presently perceived she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was -LRB-what is vernacularly termed-RRB- trailing Mrs. Dent; that is, playing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) ignorance--her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) trail might be clever, but it was decidedly not good- natured.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) played: her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) execution was brilliant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) sang: her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) voice was fine; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) talked French apart to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) mamma; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) talked it well, with fluency and with a good accent.
<p/>Mary had a milder and more open countenance than Blanche; softer features too, and a skin some shades fairer -LRB-Miss Ingram was dark as a Spaniard-RRB---but
<p/>: her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) face lacked expression, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) eye lustre; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had nothing to say, and having once taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) seat, remained fixed like a statue in its niche.
<p/>Mary was deficient in life The sisters were both attired in spotless white. And did I now think Miss Ingram such a choice as Mr. Rochester would be likely to make?
<p/>I could not tell--I did not know his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) taste in female beauty. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) liked the majestic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was the very type of majesty: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was accomplished, sprightly.
<p/>Most gentlemen would admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>), I thought; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>), I already seemed to have obtained proof: to remove the last shade of doubt, it remained but to see them together.
<p/>You are not to suppose, reader, that Adele has all this time been sitting motionless on the stool at my feet: no; when the ladies entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) rose, advanced to meet them, made a stately reverence, and said with gravity-- <div class="bookquote">``Bon jour, mesdames.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And Miss Ingram had looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) with a mocking air, and exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``Oh, what a little puppet!''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ingram/Ingram</b></font>)</div>Lady Lynn had remarked, <div class="bookquote">``It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the little French girl he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was speaking of.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Lynn</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Dent had kindly taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) hand, and given her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) a kiss. Amy and Louisa Eshton had cried out simultaneously--<div class="bookquote">``What a love of a child!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Louisa/Louisa Eshton/Eshton</b></font>)</div><p/>And then they had called her (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) to a sofa, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Amy</b></font>) now sat, ensconced between them, chattering alternately in French and broken English; absorbing not only the young ladies' attention, but that of Mrs. Eshton and Lady Lynn, and getting spoilt to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lynn</b></font>) heart's content.
<p/>At last coffee is brought in, and the gentlemen are summoned. I sit in the shade--if any shade there be in this brilliantly-lit apartment; the window-curtain half hides me.
<p/>The collective appearance of the gentlemen, like that of the ladies, is very imposing: they are all costumed in black; most of them are tall, some young.
<p/>Again the arch yawns; they come. Henry and Frederick Lynn are very dashing sparks indeed; and Colonel Dent is a fine soldierly man.
<p/>Mr. Eshton, the magistrate of the district, is gentleman-like: his (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) hair is quite white, his (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) eyebrows and whiskers still dark, which gives him (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) something of the appearance of a <div class="bookquote">``pere noble de theatre.
<p/>Lord Ingram, like his (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) sisters, is very tall; like them, also, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) is handsome; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) shares Mary's apathetic and listless look: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) seems to have more length of limb than vivacity of blood or vigour of brain.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>And where is Mr. Rochester? He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) comes in last: I am not looking at the arch, yet I see him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) enter.
<p/>I try to concentrate my attention on those netting-needles, on the meshes of the purse I am forming--I wish to think only of the work I have in my hands, to see only the silver beads and silk threads that lie in my lap; whereas, I distinctly behold his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) figure, and I inevitably recall the moment when I last saw it; just after I had rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) deemed, an essential service, and
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), holding my hand, and looking down on my face, surveyed me with eyes that revealed a heart full and eager to overflow; in whose emotions I had a part.
<p/>How near had I approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) at that moment! What had occurred since, calculated to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) and my relative positions?
<p/>Yet now, how distant, how far estranged we were! So far estranged, that I did not expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) to come and speak to me.
<p/>I did not wonder, when, without looking at me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) took a seat at the other side of the room, and began conversing with some of the ladies.
<p/>No sooner did I see that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) attention was riveted on them, and that I might gaze without being observed, than my eyes were drawn involuntarily to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) face; I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise, and the irids would fix on him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless.
<p/>I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking,--a precious yet poignant pleasure; Most true is it that <div class="bookquote">``beauty is in the eye of the gazer.
<p/>My master's colourless, olive face, square, massive brow, broad and jetty eyebrows, deep eyes, strong features, firm, grim mouth,--all energy, decision, will,--were not beautiful, according to rule; but they were more than beautiful to me; they were full of an interest,
<p/>I had not intended to love him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>); the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>), they spontaneously arrived, green and strong!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>an influence that quite mastered me,--that took my feelings from my own power and fettered them in his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) made me love him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) without looking at me.
<p/>I compared him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) guests. What was the gallant grace of the Lynns, the languid elegance of Lord Ingram,--even the military distinction of Colonel Dent, contrasted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) look of native pith and genuine power?
<p/>I had no sympathy in their appearance, their expression: yet I could imagine that most observers would call them attractive, handsome, imposing; while they would pronounce Mr. Rochester at once harsh-featured and melancholy-looking.
<p/>I saw them smile, laugh--it was nothing; the light of the candles had as much soul in it as their smile; the tinkle of the bell as much significance as their laugh.
<p/>I saw Mr. Rochester smile:--his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) stern features softened; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eye grew both brilliant and gentle, its ray both searching and sweet.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was talking, at the moment, to Louisa and Amy Eshton. I wondered to see them receive with calm that look which seemed to me so penetrating:
<p/>I expected their eyes to fall, their colour to rise under it; yet I was glad when I found they were in no sense moved.
<p/>I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is of mine;--I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is--I feel akin to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)--I understand the language of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) countenance and movements:
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is not to them what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is to me,'' I thought: <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is not of their kind. though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves
<p/>Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) but to receive my salary at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hands?
<p/>, that assimilates me mentally to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). Did I forbid myself to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) in any other light than as a paymaster?
<p/>Blasphemy against nature! Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). I know I must conceal my sentiments:
<p/>For when I say that I am of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) kind, I do not mean that I have his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) force to influence, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) spell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>I must, then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>I must smother hope; I must remember that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) cannot care much for me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Coffee is handed. The ladies, since the gentlemen entered, have become lively as larks; conversation waxes brisk and merry.
<p/>Colonel Dent and Mr. Eshton argue on politics; their wives listen. The two proud dowagers, Lady Lynn and Lady Ingram, confabulate together.
<p/>Sir George--whom, by-the-bye, I have forgotten to describe,--a very big, and very fresh-looking country gentleman, stands before their sofa, coffee- cup in hand, and occasionally puts in a word.
<p/>Mr. Frederick Lynn has taken a seat beside Mary Ingram, and is showing her (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) the engravings of a splendid volume: she (<font color='blue'><b>George</b></font>) looks, smiles now and then, but apparently says little.
<p/>The tall and phlegmatic Lord Ingram leans with folded arms on the chair-back of the little and lively Amy Eshton; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) glances up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>), and chatters like a wren: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) likes him (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) does Mr. Rochester.
<p/>Henry Lynn has taken possession of an ottoman at the feet of Louisa: Adele shares it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lynn</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Lynn</b></font>) is trying to talk French with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>), and Louisa laughs at his (<font color='blue'><b>Lynn</b></font>) blunders.
<p/>With whom will Blanche Ingram pair? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) is standing alone at the table, bending gracefully over an album. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) seems waiting to be sought; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) will not wait too long: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) herself selects a mate.
<p/>Mr. Rochester, having quitted the Eshtons, stands on the hearth as solitary as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) stands by the table: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) confronts him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) station on the opposite side of the mantelpiece.
<p/>'' Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?'' '' Nor am I. '' '' Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?
<p/>'' -LRB-pointing to Adele-RRB-. '' Where did you pick her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) up?'' <div class="bookquote">``I did not pick her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) up; she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was left on my hands.''

<p/>Oh, no! there she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) is still, behind the window- curtain. You pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>), of course; I should think it quite as expensive,--more so
<p/>I feared--or should I say, hoped?--the allusion to me would make Mr. Rochester glance my way; and I involuntarily shrank farther into the shade: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) never turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eyes.
<p/>; for you have them both to keep in addition. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I have not considered the subject,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) indifferently, looking straight before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?''
<p/>'' No, you men never do consider economy and common sense. You should hear mama on the chapter of governesses: <div class="bookquote">``Did you speak, my own?''
 (<font color='red'><b>governesses</b></font>)</div><p/>The young lady thus claimed as the dowager's special property, reiterated her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) question with an explanation. '' My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.
<p/>Mrs. Dent here bent over to the pious lady and whispered something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) ear; I suppose, from the answer elicited, it was a reminder that one of the anathematised race was present.
<p/>I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice. I thank Heaven I have now done with them!'' '' Tant pis!'' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) Ladyship, ``I hope it may do her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) good!
<p/>Then, in a lower tone, but still loud enough for me to hear, <div class="bookquote">``I noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>); I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) class.

'' I will tell you in your private ear,'' replied she (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>), wagging her (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) turban three times with portentous significancy.
<p/>'' But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.'' <div class="bookquote">``Ask Blanche; she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) is nearer you than I.

<p/>Not that I ever suffered much from them; I took care to turn the tables. What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!
<p/>The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low- spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>).
<p/>I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) yet in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) raging passions, when we had driven her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) to extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons.
<p/>Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit. But poor Madame Joubert! Theodore, do you remember those merry days?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yaas, to be sure I do,'' drawled Lord Ingram; <div class="bookquote">``and the poor old stick used to cry out ' Oh you villains
<p/>then we sermonised her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was herself so ignorant.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Lord Ingram</b></font>)</div><p/>We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting -LRB-or persecuting-RRB- your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as we used to call him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).
<p/>childs!'--and '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so
<p/>; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of `la belle passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights from the house.
<p/>Dear mama, there, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) got an inkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.
<p/>And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--
<p/>Au reste , we all know them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny and general blow-up.
<p/>Did you not, my lady-mother?'' '' Certainly, my best. '' <div class="bookquote">``Oh, gracious, mama! Spare us the enumeration! Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.

(<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Eshton</b></font>)</div>Amy Eshton, not hearing or not heeding this dictum, joined in with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) soft, infantine tone:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) was such a good creature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) would bear anything: nothing put her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) out.
<p/>No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) desk and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) workbox, and turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) drawers inside out; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) was so good-natured, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) would give us anything we asked for.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Amy/Amy Eshton</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I suppose, now,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ingram/Ingram</b></font>)</div>said Miss Ingram, curling her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) lip sarcastically, <div class="bookquote">``we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new topic.

<p/>It is my opinion the fiddler David must have been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>); and history may say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion
<p/>, he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was just the sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my hand.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Gentlemen, you hear! Now which of you most resembles Bothwell? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Rochester. '' I should say the preference lies with you,'' responded Colonel Dent.
<p/>Miss Ingram, who had now seated herself with proud grace at the piano, spreading out her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) snowy robes in queenly amplitude, commenced a brilliant prelude; talking meantime.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) appeared to be on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) high horse to-night; both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) words and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) air seemed intended to excite not only the admiration, but the amazement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) auditors: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was evidently bent on striking them as something very dashing and daring indeed.
<p/>'' On my honour, I am much obliged to you,'' was the reply. '' Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!
<p/>Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's permission and guardianship!
<p/>Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty!
<p/>'' exclaimed she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>), rattling away at the instrument. '' As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman--her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) legitimate appanage and heritage!
<p/>I grant an ugly woman is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the gentlemen , let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour: let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a fillip.
<p/>Whenever I marry,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) continued after a pause which none interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.

''
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax had said Mr. Rochester possessed a fine voice: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did--a mellow, powerful bass, into which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) threw his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) own feeling, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) own force; finding a way through the ear to the heart, and there waking sensation strangely.
<p/>I waited till the last deep and full vibration had expired--till the tide of talk, checked an instant, had resumed its flow; I then quitted my sheltered corner and made my exit by the side-door, which was fortunately near.
<p/>Now is my time to slip away,'' thought I: but the tones that then severed the air arrested me. Thence a narrow passage led into the hall
<p/>: in crossing it, I perceived my sandal was loose; I stopped to tie it, kneeling down for that purpose on the mat at the foot of the staircase.
<p/>I heard the dining-room door unclose; a gentleman came out; rising hastily, I stood face to face with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>): it was Mr. Rochester.
<p/>'' How do you do? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) asked. '' I am very well, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought I might have retorted the question on him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) who put it: but I would not take that freedom.
<p/>I answered-- <div class="bookquote">``I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``What have you been doing during my absence?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual.'' '' And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight.
<p/>What is the matter?'' '' Nothing at all, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not the least.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early.

<p/>But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag.
<p/>If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a servant passing, I would know what all this means.
<p/>Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening

<p/>CHAPTER XVIII Merry days were these at Thornfield Hall; and busy days too: how different from the first three months of stillness, monotony, and solitude I had passed beneath its roof!
<p/>All sad feelings seemed now driven from the house, all gloomy associations forgotten: there was life everywhere, movement all day long.
<p/>You could not now traverse the gallery, once so hushed, nor enter the front chambers, once so tenantless, without encountering a smart lady's-maid or a dandy valet.
<p/>The kitchen, the butler's pantry, the servants' hall, the entrance hall, were equally alive; and the saloons were only left void and still when the blue sky and halcyon sunshine of the genial spring weather called their occupants out into the grounds.
<p/>Even when that weather was broken, and continuous rain set in for some days, no damp seemed cast over enjoyment: indoor amusements only became more lively and varied, in consequence of the stop put to outdoor gaiety.
<p/>Now go, and send Sophie for Adele. Good-night, my--'' He (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) stopped, bit his (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) lip, and abruptly left me. I wondered what they were going to do the first evening
<p/>a change of entertainment was proposed: they spoke of <div class="bookquote">``playing charades,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but in my ignorance I did not understand the term.
<p/>The servants were called in, the dining-room tables wheeled away, the lights otherwise disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch.
<p/>While Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids.
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.
<p/>Meantime, Mr. Rochester had again summoned the ladies round him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), and was selecting certain of their number to be of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) party.
<p/>'' Miss Ingram is mine, of course,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) named the two Misses Eshton, and Mrs. Dent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) looked at me:
<p/>I happened to be near him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), as I had been fastening the clasp of Mrs. Dent's bracelet, which had got loose.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did not insist, which I rather feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would have done; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) allowed me to return quietly to my usual seat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) aids now withdrew behind the curtain: the other party, which was headed by Colonel Dent, sat down on the crescent of chairs.
<p/>One of the gentlemen, Mr. Eshton, observing me, seemed to propose that I should be asked to join them; but Lady Ingram instantly negatived the notion.
<p/>'' Will you play? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) asked. I shook my head. '' No,'' I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) say: <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) looks too stupid for any game of the sort.
<p/>Within the arch, the bulky figure of Sir George Lynn, whom Mr. Rochester had likewise chosen, was seen enveloped in a white sheet: before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), on a table, lay open a large book; and at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) side stood Amy Eshton, draped in Mr. Rochester's cloak, and holding a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Somebody, unseen, rang the bell merrily; then Adele -LRB-who had insisted on being one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) guardian's party-RRB-, bounded forward, scattering round her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) the contents of a basket of flowers she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) carried on her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) arm.
<p/>Then appeared the magnificent figure of Miss Ingram, clad in white, a long veil on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) head, and a wreath of roses round her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) brow; by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) side walked Mr. Rochester, and together they drew near the table.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Ere long a bell tinkled, and the curtain drew up. They knelt; while Mrs. Dent and Louisa Eshton, dressed also in white, took up their stations behind them.
<p/>A ceremony followed, in dumb show, in which it was easy to recognise the pantomime of a marriage. At its termination, Colonel Dent and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) party consulted in whispers for two minutes, then the Colonel called out-- <div class="bookquote">``Bride!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Rochester bowed, and the curtain fell. A considerable interval elapsed before it again rose. Its second rising displayed a more elaborately prepared scene than the last.
<p/>The drawing- room, as I have before observed, was raised two steps above the dining- room, and on the top of the upper step, placed a yard or two back within the room, appeared a large marble basin--which I recognised as an ornament of the conservatory--where it usually stood, surrounded by exotics, and tenanted by gold fish--and whence it must have been transported with some trouble, on account of its size and weight.
<p/>Seated on the carpet, by the side of this basin, was seen Mr. Rochester, costumed in shawls, with a turban on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) head.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) dark eyes and swarthy skin and Paynim features suited the costume exactly: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) looked the very model of an Eastern emir, an agent or a victim of the bowstring.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>), too, was attired in oriental fashion: a crimson scarf tied sash-like round the waist: an embroidered handkerchief knotted about her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) temples; her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) beautifully-moulded arms bare, one of them upraised in the act of supporting a pitcher, poised gracefully on her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) head.
<p/>Both her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) cast of form and feature, her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) complexion and her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) general air, suggested the idea of some Israelitish princess of the patriarchal days; and such was doubtless the character she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) intended to represent.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) approached the basin, and bent over it as if to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) pitcher; she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) again lifted it to her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) head.
<p/>The personage on the well-brink now seemed to accost her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>); to make some request:--<div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) hasted, let down her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) pitcher on her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) hand, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) to drink.
<p/>From the bosom of his (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) robe he (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) then produced a casket, opened it and showed magnificent bracelets and earrings; she (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) acted astonishment and admiration; kneeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>pitcher</b></font>) laid the treasure at her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) feet; incredulity and delight were expressed by her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) looks and gestures; the stranger fastened the bracelets on her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) arms and the rings in her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) ears.
<p/>The divining party again laid their heads together: apparently they could not agree about the word or syllable the scene illustrated.
<p/>Presently advanced into view Miss Ingram. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The personage</b></font>)</div>It was Eliezer and Rebecca: the camels only were wanting. Colonel Dent, their spokesman, demanded <div class="bookquote">``the tableau of the whole;''  (<font color='red'><b>spokesman</b></font>)</div>whereupon the curtain again descended.
<p/>On its third rising only a portion of the drawing-room was disclosed; the rest being concealed by a screen, hung with some sort of dark and coarse drapery.
<p/>The marble basin was removed; in its place, stood a deal table and a kitchen chair: these objects were visible by a very dim light proceeding from a horn lantern, the wax candles being all extinguished.
<p/>Amidst this sordid scene, sat a man with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) clenched hands resting on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knees, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes bent on the ground.
<p/>I knew Mr. Rochester; though the begrimed face, the disordered dress -LRB-his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) coat hanging loose from one arm, as if it had been almost torn from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) back in a scuffle-RRB-, the desperate and scowling countenance, the rough, bristling hair might well have disguised him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) moved, a chain clanked; to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) wrists were attached fetters. '' Bridewell! '' exclaimed Colonel Dent, and the charade was solved.
<p/>A sufficient interval having elapsed for the performers to resume their ordinary costume, they re-entered the dining-room. Mr. Rochester led in Miss Ingram; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was complimenting him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) acting.
<p/>'' Do you know,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``that, of the three characters, I liked you in the last best? Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is all the soot washed from my face? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) asked, turning it towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>). '' Alas! yes: the more's the pity!
<p/>Nothing could be more becoming to your complexion than that ruffian's rouge. '' <div class="bookquote">``You would like a hero of the road then?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour since, in the presence of all these witnesses.
<p/>'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) giggled, and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) colour rose. '' Now, Dent,'' continued Mr. Rochester, <div class="bookquote">``it is your turn. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>And as the other party withdrew, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) band took the vacated seats.
<p/>Miss Ingram placed herself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) leader's right hand; the other diviners filled the chairs on each side of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>).
<p/>I did not now watch the actors; I no longer waited with interest for the curtain to rise; my attention was absorbed by the spectators; my eyes, erewhile fixed on the arch, were now irresistibly attracted to the semicircle of chairs.
<p/>Colonel Dent and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) party played, what word they chose, how they acquitted themselves, I no longer remember; but I still see the consultation which followed each scene: I see Mr. Rochester turn to Miss Ingram, and Miss Ingram to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) incline her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) head towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), till the jetty curls almost touch his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) shoulder and wave against his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) cheek; I hear their mutual whisperings; I recall their interchanged glances; and something even of the feeling roused by the spectacle returns in memory at this moment.
<p/>I have told you, reader, that I had learnt to love Mr. Rochester: I could not unlove him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) now, merely because I found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had ceased to notice me--because I might pass hours in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) presence, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would never once turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eyes in my direction--because I saw all his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) attentions appropriated by a great lady, who scorned to touch me with the hem of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) robes as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) passed; who, if ever her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) dark and imperious eye fell on me by chance, would withdraw it instantly as from an object too mean to merit observation.
<p/>I could not unlove him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), because I felt sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would soon marry this very lady--because I read daily in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a proud security in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) intentions respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)--because I witnessed hourly in him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) a style of courtship which, if careless and choosing rather to be sought than to seek, was yet, in its very carelessness, captivating, and in its very pride, irresistible.
<p/>Much too, you will think, reader, to engender jealousy: if a woman, in my position, could presume to be jealous of a woman in Miss Ingram's.
<p/>What charade There was nothing to cool or banish love in these circumstances, though much to create despair. But I was not jealous: or
<p/>very rarely;--the nature of the pain I suffered could not be explained by that word. Miss Ingram was a mark beneath jealousy: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was too inferior to excite the feeling.
<p/>Pardon the seeming paradox ; I mean what I say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was very showy, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was not genuine : she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had a fine person, many brilliant attainments; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) mind was poor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) heart barren by nature:
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was not good; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) was not original: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) used to repeat sounding phrases from books: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) never offered, nor had, an opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) own.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) advocated a high tone of sentiment; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) did not know the sensations of sympathy and pity; tenderness and truth were not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>).
<p/>Too often she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) betrayed this, by the undue vent she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) gave to a spiteful antipathy she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had conceived against little Adele: pushing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) away with some contumelious epithet if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) happened to approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>); sometimes ordering her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) from the room, and always treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) with coldness and acrimony.
<p/>nothing bloomed spontaneously on that soil; no unforced natural fruit delighted by its freshness. Other eyes besides mine watched these manifestations of character--watched them closely, keenly, shrewdly.
<p/>Yes; the future bridegroom, Mr. Rochester himself, exercised over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) intended a ceaseless surveillance; and it was from this sagacity--this guardedness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)--this perfect, clear consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) fair one's defects--this obvious absence of passion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sentiments towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>), that my ever- torturing pain arose.
<p/>I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was going to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>), for family, perhaps political reasons, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) rank and connections suited him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); I felt he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had not given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) love, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) qualifications were ill adapted to win from him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) that treasure.
<p/>This was the point--this was where the nerve was touched and teased--this was where the fever was sustained and fed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) could not charm him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) .
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had managed the victory at once, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had yielded and sincerely laid his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) heart at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) feet, I should have covered my face, turned to the wall, and -LRB-figuratively-RRB- have died to them.
<p/>If Miss Ingram had been a good and noble woman, endowed with force, fervour, kindness, sense, I should have had one vital struggle with two tigers--jealousy and despair: then, my heart torn out and devoured, I should have admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>)--acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) excellence, and been quiet for the rest of my days: and the more absolute her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) superiority, the deeper would have been my admiration--the more truly tranquil my quiescence.
<p/>But as matters really stood, to watch Miss Ingram's efforts at fascinating Mr. Rochester, to witness their repeated failure--herself unconscious that they did fail; vainly fancying that each shaft launched hit the mark, and infatuatedly pluming herself on success, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) pride and self-complacency repelled further and further what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) wished to allure--to witness this , was to be at once under ceaseless excitation and ruthless restraint.
<p/>Arrows that continually glanced off from Mr. Rochester's breast and fell harmless at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) feet, might, I knew, if shot by a surer hand, have quivered keen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) proud heart--have called love into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) stern eye, and softness into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sardonic face; or, better still, without weapons a silent conquest might have been won.
<p/>Because, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) failed, I saw how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) might have succeeded. '' Why can she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) not influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) more, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) is privileged to draw so near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)?
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) need not coin her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) smiles so lavishly, flash her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate, graces so multitudinous.
<p/>It seems to me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) might, by merely sitting quietly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) side, saying little and looking less, get nigher his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) heart.
<p/>I have seen in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) face a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) is so vivaciously accosting him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) asked without pretension, to address him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) when needful without grimace--and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam.
<p/>'' I asked myself. '' Surely she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) cannot truly like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), or not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) with true affection! How will she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) manage to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) when they are married?
<p/>I do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) will manage it; and yet it might be managed; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on.
<p/>It surprised me when I first discovered that such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) intention: I had thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) a man unlikely to be influenced by motives so commonplace in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) choice of a wife; but the longer I considered the position, education, &c., of the parties, the less I felt justified in judging and blaming either him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) or Miss Ingram for acting in conformity to ideas and principles instilled into them, doubtless, from their childhood.
<p/>All their class held these principles: I supposed, then, they had reasons for holding them such as I could not fathom.
<p/>It seemed to me that, were I a gentleman like him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), I would take to my bosom only such a wife as I could love; but the very obviousness of the advantages to the husband's own happiness offered by this plan convinced me that there must be arguments against its general adoption of which I was quite ignorant
<p/>'' I have not yet said anything condemnatory of Mr. Rochester's project of marrying for interest and connections. : otherwise I felt sure all the world would act as I wished to act.
<p/>But in other points, as well as this, I was growing very lenient to my master: I was forgetting all his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) faults, for which I had once kept a sharp look-out.
<p/>It had formerly been my endeavour to study all sides of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) character: to take the bad with the good; and from the just weighing of both, to form an equitable judgment.
<p/>The sarcasm that had repelled, the harshness that had startled me once, were only like keen condiments in a choice dish: their presence was pungent, but their absence would be felt as comparatively insipid.
<p/>Now I saw no bad. And as for the vague something--was it a sinister or a sorrowful, a designing or a desponding
<p/>expression?--that opened upon a careful observer, now and then, in his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) eye, and closed again before one could fathom the strange depth partially disclosed;
<p/>that something which used to make me fear and shrink, as if I had been wandering amongst volcanic-looking hills, and had suddenly felt the ground quiver and seen it gape:
<p/>Instead of wishing to shun, I longed only to dare--to divine it; and I thought Miss Ingram happy, because one day she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) might look into the abyss at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) leisure, explore its secrets and analyse their nature.
<p/>Meantime, while I thought only of my master and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) future bride--saw only them, heard only their discourse, and considered only their movements of importance--the rest of the party were occupied with their own separate interests and pleasures.
<p/>The Ladies Lynn and Ingram continued to consort in solemn conferences, where they nodded their two turbans at each other, and held up their four hands in confronting gestures of surprise, or mystery, or horror, according to the theme on which their gossip ran, like a pair of magnified puppets.
<p/>that something, I, at intervals, beheld still; and with throbbing heart, but not with palsied nerves. Mild Mrs. Dent talked with good-natured Mrs. Eshton; and the two sometimes bestowed a courteous word or smile on me.
<p/>Lord Ingram flirted with Amy Eshton; Louisa played and sang to and with one of the Messrs. Lynn; and Mary Ingram listened languidly to the gallant speeches of the other.
<p/>Sometimes all, as with one consent, suspended their by-play to observe and listen to the principal actors: for, after all, Mr. Rochester and--because closely connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)--
<p/>Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and Mr. Eshton discussed politics, or county affairs, or justice business. Miss Ingram were the life and soul of the party.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) was absent from the room an hour, a perceptible dulness seemed to steal over the spirits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) guests; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) re-entrance was sure to give a fresh impulse to the vivacity of conversation.
<p/>The want of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) animating influence appeared to be peculiarly felt one day that he (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) had been summoned to Millcote on business, and was not likely to return till late.
<p/>The afternoon was wet: a walk the party had proposed to take to see a gipsy camp, lately pitched on a common beyond Hay, was consequently deferred.
<p/>Some of the gentlemen were gone to the stables: the younger ones, together with the younger ladies, were playing billiards in the billiard-room.
<p/>Blanche Ingram, after having repelled, by supercilious taciturnity, some efforts of Mrs. Dent and Mrs. Eshton to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) into conversation, had first murmured over some sentimental tunes and airs on the piano, and then, having fetched a novel from the library, had flung herself in haughty listlessness on a sofa, and prepared to beguile, by the spell of fiction, the tedious hours of absence.
<p/>The dowagers Ingram and Lynn sought solace in a quiet game at cards. The room and the house were silent: only now and then the merriment of the billiard-players was heard from above.
<p/>It was verging on dusk, and the clock had already given warning of the hour to dress for dinner, when little Adele, who knelt by me in the drawing-room window-seat, suddenly exclaimed-- <div class="bookquote">``Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!
<p/>I turned, and Miss Ingram darted forwards from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) sofa: the others, too, looked up from their several occupations; for at the same time a crunching of wheels and a splashing tramp of horse-hoofs became audible on the wet gravel.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>A post-chaise was approaching. '' What can possess him (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) to come home in that style?'' said Miss Ingram. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) rode Mesrour -LRB-the black horse-RRB-, did he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) not, when he (<font color='blue'><b>tramp</b></font>) went out?
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) tall person and ample garments so near the window, that I was obliged to bend back almost to the breaking of my spine: in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) eagerness she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) did not observe me at first, but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) curled her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) lip and moved to another casement.
<p/>The post-chaise stopped; the driver rang the door-bell, and a gentleman alighted attired in travelling garb; but it was not Mr. Rochester
<p/>and Pilot was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>):--what has he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) done with the animals? '' ; it was a tall, fashionable-looking man, a stranger.
<p/>'' How provoking! '' exclaimed Miss Ingram: <div class="bookquote">``you tiresome monkey! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ingram/Ingram</b></font>)</div>-LRB-apostrophising Adele-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``who perched you up in the window to give false intelligence?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Adele</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) cast on me an angry glance, as if I were in fault. Some parleying was audible in the hall, and soon the new-comer entered.
<p/>It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>monkey</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``when my friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate acquaintance as to instal myself here till he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) returns.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) manner was polite; his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) accent, in speaking, struck me as being somewhat unusual,--not precisely foreign, but still not altogether English: his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) age might be about Mr. Rochester's,--between thirty and forty; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) complexion was singularly sallow: otherwise he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was a fine-looking man, at first sight especially.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) bowed to Lady Ingram, as deeming her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) the eldest lady present. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' On closer examination, you detected something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) face that displeased, or rather that failed to please.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) features were regular, but too relaxed: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eye was large and well cut, but the life looking out of it was a tame, vacant life--at least so I thought.
<p/>The sound of the dressing-bell dispersed the party. It was not till after dinner that I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) again: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) then seemed quite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) ease.
<p/>But I liked his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) physiognomy even less than before: it struck me as being at the same time unsettled and inanimate.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eye wandered, and had no meaning in its wandering: this gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) an odd look, such as I never remembered to have seen.
<p/>For a handsome and not an unamiable-looking man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) repelled me exceedingly: there was no power in that smooth-skinned face of a full oval shape:
<p/>no firmness in that aquiline nose and small cherry mouth ; there was no thought on the low, even forehead; no command in that blank, brown eye.
<p/>As I sat in my usual nook, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with the light of the girandoles on the mantelpiece beaming full over him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) occupied an arm-chair drawn close to the fire, and kept shrinking still nearer, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) were cold, I compared him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with Mr. Rochester.
<p/>I think -LRB-with deference be it spoken-RRB- the contrast could not be much greater between a sleek gander and a fierce falcon: between a meek sheep and the rough-coated keen-eyed dog, its guardian.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had spoken of Mr. Rochester as an old friend. A curious friendship theirs must have been: a pointed illustration, indeed, of the old adage that ``extremes meet.
<p/>Two or three of the gentlemen sat near him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), and I caught at times scraps of their conversation across the room.
<p/>At first I could not make much sense of what I heard; for the discourse of Louisa Eshton and Mary Ingram, who sat nearer to me, confused the fragmentary sentences that reached me at intervals.
<p/>Louisa said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was <div class="bookquote">``a love of a creature,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``adored him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>);''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and Mary instanced his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``pretty little mouth, and nice nose,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ann/Mary Ann Wilson</b></font>)</div>as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ideal of the charming.
<p/>'' These last were discussing the stranger; they both called him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``a beautiful man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>'' And what a sweet-tempered forehead he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) has!
<p/>And then, to my great relief, Mr. Henry Lynn summoned them to the other side of the room, to settle some point about the deferred excursion to Hay Common.
<p/>I was now able to concentrate my attention on the group by the fire, and I presently gathered that the new-comer was called Mr. Mason; then I learned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was but just arrived in England, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) came from some hot country: which was the reason, doubtless, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) face was so sallow, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) sat so near the hearth, and wore a surtout in the house.
<p/>Presently the words Jamaica, Kingston, Spanish Town, indicated the West Indies as his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) residence; and it was with no little surprise I gathered, ere long, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) had there first seen and become acquainted with Mr. Rochester.

<p/>I knew Mr. Rochester had been a traveller: Mrs. Fairfax had said so; but I thought the continent of Europe had bounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) wanderings; till now I had never heard a hint given of visits to more distant shores.
<p/>Mr. Mason, shivering as some one chanced to open the door, asked for more coal to be put on the fire, which had burnt out its flame, though its mass of cinder still shone hot and red.
<p/>The footman who brought the coal, in going out, stopped near Mr. Eshton's chair, and said something to him (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) in a low voice, of which I heard only the words, <div class="bookquote">``old woman,'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``quite troublesome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) come--it will be excellent sport!''  (<font color='red'><b>The footman</b></font>)</div>The footman still lingered.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ingram/Ingram</b></font>)</div>ejaculated Miss Ingram, and the man went. Excitement instantly seized the whole party: a running fire of raillery and jests was proceeding when Sam returned.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) won't come now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) says, sir, that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble themselves to come near her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); nor,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Dent</b></font>) added, with difficulty suppressing a titter, <div class="bookquote">``any ladies either, except the young, and single.''

<p/>Miss Ingram rose solemnly: <div class="bookquote">``I go first,''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ingram/Ingram</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) said, in a tone which might have befitted the leader of a forlorn hope, mounting a breach in the van of his (<font color='blue'><b>leader</b></font>) men.
<p/>'' was her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) mama's cry; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) swept past her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) in stately silence, passed through the door which Colonel Dent held open, and we heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) enter the library.
<p/>'' Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect! A comparative silence ensued. Lady Ingram thought it <div class="bookquote">``le cas''  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Ingram</b></font>)</div>to wring her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) hands: which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) did accordingly.
<p/>Miss Mary declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) part, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never dared venture. Amy and Louisa Eshton tittered under their breath, and looked a little frightened.
<p/>The minutes passed very slowly: fifteen were counted before the library- door again opened. Miss Ingram returned to us through the arch.
<p/>All eyes met her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) with a glance of eager curiosity, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) met all eyes with one of rebuff and coldness
<p/>Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) laugh? Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) take it as a joke? ; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) looked neither flurried nor merry: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) walked stiffly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) seat, and took it in silence.
<p/>'' Well, Blanche?'' said Lord Ingram. '' What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Blanche</b></font>) say, sister? '' asked Mary. '' What did you think? How do you feel?--Is
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a real fortune-teller? '' demanded the Misses Eshton. '' Now, now, good people,'' returned Miss Ingram, <div class="bookquote">``don't press upon me.
<p/>: you seem, by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman.
<p/>I have seen a gipsy vagabond; she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell.
<p/>My whim is gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow morning, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Eshton</b></font>) threatened.
<p/>Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited ''  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Ingram/Ingram</b></font>)</div>Miss Ingram took a book, leant back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) chair, and so declined further conversation.
<p/>I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) for nearly half-an-hour: during all that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) never turned a page, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) face grew momently darker, more dissatisfied, and more sourly expressive of disappointment.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had obviously not heard anything to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) advantage: and it seemed to me, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) prolonged fit of gloom and taciturnity, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) herself, notwithstanding her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) professed indifference, attached undue importance to whatever revelations had been made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>). -LCB-
<p/>During all that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) never turned a page: p184.jpg-RCB- Meantime, Mary Ingram, Amy and Louisa Eshton, declared they dared not go alone; and yet they all wished to go.
<p/>A negotiation was opened through the medium of the ambassador, Sam; and after much pacing to and fro, till, I think, the said Sam's calves must have ached with the exercise, permission was at last, with great difficulty, extorted from the rigorous Sibyl, for the three to wait upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) in a body.
<p/>Their visit was not so still as Miss Ingram's had been: we heard hysterical giggling and little shrieks proceeding from the library; and at the end of about twenty minutes they burst the door open, and came running across the hall, as if they were half-scared out of their wits.
<p/>'' I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) is something not right! '' they cried, one and all. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) told us such things!
<p/>Pressed for further explanation, they declared she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had told them of things they had said and done when they were mere children; described books and ornaments they had in their boudoirs at home: keepsakes that different relations had presented to them.
<p/>They affirmed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had even divined their thoughts, and had whispered in the ear of each the name of the person she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) liked best in the world, and informed them of what they most wished for.
<p/>Here the gentlemen interposed with earnest petitions to be further enlightened on these two last-named points; but they got only blushes, ejaculations, tremors, and titters, in return for their importunity.
<p/>The matrons, meantime, offered vinaigrettes and wielded fans; and again and again reiterated the expression of their concern that their warning had not been taken in time; and the elder gentlemen laughed, and the younger urged their services on the agitated fair ones.
<p/>In the midst of the tumult, and while my eyes and ears were fully engaged in the scene before me, I heard a hem close at my elbow: I turned, and saw Sam.
<p/>If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young single lady in the room who has not been to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) yet, and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) swears she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) will not go till she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) has seen all.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knows all about us!'' and they sank breathless into the various seats the gentlemen hastened to bring them. '' I thought it must be you: there is no one else for it.
<p/>Oh, I will go by all means,'' I answered: and I was glad of the unexpected opportunity to gratify my much-excited curiosity.
<p/>I slipped out of the room, unobserved by any eye--for the company were gathered in one mass about the trembling trio just returned--and I closed the door quietly behind me.
<p/>What shall I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>)?'' '' '' If you like, miss,'' said Sam, <div class="bookquote">``I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) frightens you, just call
<p/>and I'll come in.''  (<font color='red'><b>Sam</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Nor was I; but I was a good deal interested and excited.
<p/>The library looked tranquil enough as I entered it, and the Sibyl--if Sibyl she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) were--was seated snugly enough in an easy-chair at the chimney- corner.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) had on a red cloak and a black bonnet: or rather, a broad- brimmed gipsy hat, tied down with a striped handkerchief under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) chin.
<p/>An extinguished candle stood on the table; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) was bending over the fire, and seemed reading in a little black book, like a prayer-book, by the light of the blaze: she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) muttered the words to herself, as most old women do, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) read; she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) did not desist immediately on my entrance: it appeared she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) wished to finish a paragraph.
<p/>I stood on the rug and warmed my hands, which were rather cold with sitting at a distance from the drawing-room fire.
<p/>I felt now as composed as ever I did in my life: there was nothing indeed in the gipsy's appearance to trouble one's calm.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) shut her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) book and slowly looked up; her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) hat-brim partially shaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) face, yet I could see, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) raised it, that it was a strange one.
<p/>locks bristled out from beneath a white band which passed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) chin, and came half over her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) cheeks, or rather jaws: her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) eye confronted me at once, with a bold and direct gaze.
<p/>CHAPTER XIX It looked all brown and black: elf- '' Well, and you want your fortune told? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) said, in a voice as decided as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) glance, as harsh as her (<font color='blue'><b>Sibyl</b></font>) features.
<p/>'' I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to warn you, I have no faith.''
<p/>It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in your step as you crossed the threshold.

 (<font color='red'><b>The crone</b></font>)</div><p/>The old crone <div class="bookquote">``nichered''  (<font color='red'><b>The crone</b></font>)</div>a laugh under her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bonnet and bandage; she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) then drew out a short black pipe, and lighting it began to smoke.
<p/>Having indulged a while in this sedative, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) bent body, took the pipe from her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lips, and while gazing steadily at the fire, said very deliberately--<div class="bookquote">``You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not sick. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Why don't you consult my art?''

<p/>I will, in few words. You are cold, because you are alone: no contact strikes the fire from you that is in you.
<p/>You are sick; because the best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from you.
<p/>You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits you.
<p/>You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a solitary dependent in a great house.''
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) again put her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) short black pipe to her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) lips, and renewed her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) smoking with vigour.

<p/>'' And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?'' '' To be sure. '' I did. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) approached her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) face to the palm, and pored over it without touching it.
<p/>'' It is too fine,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). '' I can make nothing of such a hand as that; almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?

<p/>'' I knelt within half a yard of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). '' I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had examined me a while.
<p/>I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance.''

<p/>I said this rather to myself than to the gipsy, whose strange talk, voice, manner, had by this time wrapped me in a kind of dream.
<p/>One unexpected sentence came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) lips after another, till I got involved in a web of mystification; and wondered what unseen spirit had been sitting for weeks by my heart watching its workings and taking record of every pulse.
<p/>Eagerness of a listener!'' repeated she (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by the hour, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); you have noticed this?''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Grateful! I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) face.''

<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Humph! Not exactly. Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the devil</b></font>)</div>'' What the devil have you seen, then?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess. Is it known that Mr. Rochester is to be married?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt -LRB-though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it-RRB-, they will be a superlatively happy pair.

(<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last degree; though -LRB-God pardon me!-RRB-
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) something on that point about an hour ago which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) look wondrous grave: the corners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) mouth fell half an inch.
<p/>But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it.''
<p/>I would advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or clearer rent-roll,--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)'s dished--'' '' ''
<p/>Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait contradicted another. Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that I know.
<p/>I knew it before I came here this evening. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) has laid it carefully on one side for you. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) do it.
<p/>It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study.
<p/>Kneel again on the rug. '' <div class="bookquote">``Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>-LCB-She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) chair:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible; impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid:
<p/>p190.jpg-RCB- I knelt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) did not stoop towards me, but only gazed, leaning back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) chair. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) began muttering,-- that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.
<p/>It turns from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion.
<p/>As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent on much the heart experiences.
<p/>Mobile and flexible, it was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection for its interlocutor.
<p/>I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do.
<p/>I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.'
<p/>The forehead declares, `Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to wild chasms.
<p/>The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in every decision.
<p/>Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of conscience.'
<p/>The eye is favourable. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>That feature too is propitious. '' I need not sell my soul to buy bliss. ''
<p/>I have formed my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.
<p/>if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.
<p/>I wish to foster, not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet
<p/>Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected. I know how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, --That will do.
<p/>I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium. I should wish now to protract this moment ad infinitum ; but I dare not.
<p/>So far I have governed myself thoroughly. I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my strength.
<p/>Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played out'. '' Where was I? Did I wake or sleep? Had I been dreaming?
<p/>The old woman's voice had changed: her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) accent, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) gesture, and all were familiar to me as my own face in a glass--as the speech of my own tongue.
<p/>I looked; I stirred the fire, and I looked again: but she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bonnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bandage closer about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, and again beckoned me to depart.
<p/>The flame illuminated her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand stretched out: roused now, and on the alert for discoveries, I at once noticed that hand.
<p/>It was no more the withered limb of eld than my own; it was a rounded supple member, with smooth fingers, symmetrically turned; a broad ring flashed on the little finger, and stooping forward, I looked at it, and saw a gem I had seen a hundred times before.
<p/>Again I looked at the face; which was no longer turned from me--on the contrary, the bonnet was doffed, the bandage displaced, the head advanced.
<p/>Did I dream still? I got up, but did not go. '' Well, Jane, do you know me?'' asked the familiar voice.
<p/>'' Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--'' <div class="bookquote">``But the string is in a knot--help me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Break it, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' There, then--`Off, ye lendings!' '' And Mr. Rochester stepped out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) disguise. '' Now, sir, what a strange idea!''
<p/>'' But well carried out, eh? Don't you think so?'' <div class="bookquote">``With the ladies you must have managed well.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' But not with you?''
<p/>'' You did not act the character of a gipsy with me. '' '' What character did I act? My own?''
<p/>In short, I believe you have been trying to draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense.
<p/>'' No; some unaccountable one. It is scarcely fair, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you forgive me, Jane?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.
<p/>If, on reflection, I find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; but it was not right.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible. '' I reflected, and thought, on the whole, I had. It was a comfort; but, indeed, I had been on my guard almost from the beginning of the interview.
<p/>I knew gipsies and fortune-tellers did not express themselves as this seeming old woman had expressed herself; besides I had noted her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feigned voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) anxiety to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) features.
<p/>Something of masquerade I suspected. But my mind had been running on Grace Poole--that living enigma, that mystery of mysteries, as I considered her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>I had never thought of Mr. Rochester. '' Well,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``what are you musing about? What does that grave smile signify?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Wonder and self-congratulation, sir. I have your permission to retire now, I suppose?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room yonder are doing.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Discussing the gipsy, I daresay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.
<p/>Oh, are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you left this morning?'' '' A stranger!--no ; who can it be?
<p/>No; he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had known you long, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) could take the liberty of installing himself here till you returned.
<p/>I expected no one; is he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) gone?'' '' '' '' The devil he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) did! Did he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) give his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) name?'' '' His (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) name is Mason, sir; and he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) comes from the West Indies; from Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think.
<p/>As I spoke he (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) gave my wrist a convulsive grip; the smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) lips froze: apparently a spasm caught his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) breath.
<p/>'' Mr. Rochester was standing near me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had taken my hand, as if to lead me to a chair. ''
<p/>Mason!--the West Indies!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) said, in the tone one might fancy a speaking automaton to enounce its single words; <div class="bookquote">``Mason!--the West Indies!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) reiterated; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) went over the syllables three times, growing, in the intervals of speaking, whiter than ashes: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) hardly seemed to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was doing.
<p/>'' Do you feel ill, sir? '' I inquired. '' Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) staggered.
<p/>'' Oh, lean on me, sir.'' '' Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now. ''
<p/>Holding my hand in both his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) chafed it; gazing on me, at the same time, with the most troubled and dreary look.
<p/>My little friend!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I wish I were in a quiet island with only you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, sir, yes; and my arm. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sat down, and made me sit beside him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). '' <div class="bookquote">``Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir. Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) is doing.
<p/>I found all the party in the dining-room at supper, as Mr. Rochester had said; they were not seated at table,--the supper was arranged on the sideboard; each had taken what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) chose, and they stood about here and there in groups, their plates and glasses in their hands.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I went. Every one seemed in high glee; laughter and conversation were general and animated. Mr. Mason stood near the fire, talking to Colonel and Mrs. Dent, and appeared as merry as any of them.
<p/>-LRB-I saw Miss Ingram watch me frowningly as I did so: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) thought I was taking a liberty, I daresay-RRB-, and I returned to the library.
<p/>I filled a wine-glass Mr. Rochester's extreme pallor had disappeared, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) looked once more firm and stern. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) took the glass from my hand.
<p/>'' Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) swallowed the contents and returned it to me. '' What are they doing, Jane?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Laughing and talking, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``And Mason?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was laughing too.'' '' If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do, Jane?''
<p/>But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off and left me one by one, what then?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) half smiled. '' Would you go with them?'' <div class="bookquote">``I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>'' To comfort me?'' '' Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.'' '' And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should care nothing about it.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then, you could dare censure for my sake?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): show him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) in here and then leave me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as you, I am sure, do.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>I sought Mr. Mason, delivered the message, and preceded him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) from the room: I ushered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) into the library, and then I went upstairs.
<p/>At a late hour, after I had been in bed some time, I heard the visitors repair to their chambers: I distinguished Mr. Rochester's voice, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) say, <div class="bookquote">``This way, Mason; this is your room.
<p/>Yes, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I did his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) behest. The company all stared at me as I passed straight among them. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) spoke cheerfully: the gay tones set my heart at ease.
<p/>I was soon asleep. CHAPTER XX I had forgotten to draw my curtain, which I usually did, and also to let down my window-blind.
<p/>The consequence was, that when the moon, which was full and bright -LRB-for the night was fine-RRB-, came in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) course to that space in the sky opposite my casement, and looked in at me through the unveiled panes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) glorious gaze roused me.
<p/>Awaking in the dead of night, I opened my eyes on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) disk--silver-white and crystal clear. It was beautiful, but too solemn; I half rose, and stretched my arm to draw the curtain.
<p/>The night--its silence--its rest, was rent in twain by a savage, a sharp, a shrilly sound that ran from end to end of Thornfield Hall.
<p/>Good God! What a cry! My pulse stopped: my heart stood still; my stretched arm was paralysed. The cry died, and was not renewed.
<p/>Indeed, whatever being uttered that fearful shriek could not soon repeat it: not the widest-winged condor on the Andes could, twice in succession, send out such a yell from the cloud shrouding his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eyrie.
<p/>The thing delivering such utterance must rest ere it could repeat the effort. It came out of the third storey; for it passed overhead.
<p/>And overhead--yes, in the room just above my chamber-ceiling--I now heard a struggle: a deadly one it seemed from the noise; and a half-smothered voice shouted-- <div class="bookquote">``Help!
<p/>help! help! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>three times rapidly. '' Will no one come? '' it cried; and then, while the staggering and stamping went on wildly, I distinguished through plank and plaster:--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rochester! Rochester! for God's sake, come! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A chamber-door opened: some one ran, or rushed, along the gallery. Another step stamped on the flooring above and something fell; and there was silence.
<p/>The sleepers were all aroused: ejaculations, terrified murmurs sounded in every room; door after door unclosed; one looked out and another looked out; the gallery filled.
<p/>I had put on some clothes, though horror shook all my limbs; I issued from my apartment. Gentlemen and ladies alike had quitted their beds; and <div class="bookquote">``Oh!
<p/>what is it?'' (<font color='red'><b>ladies</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Who is hurt?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``What has happened?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Fetch a light!'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Is it fire?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Are there robbers?'' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">``Where shall we run? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was demanded confusedly on all hands.
<p/>But for the moonlight they would have been in complete darkness. They ran to and fro; they crowded together: some sobbed, some stumbled: the confusion was inextricable.
<p/>'' Where the devil is Rochester? '' cried Colonel Dent. '' I cannot find him (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) bed. '' <div class="bookquote">``Here! here!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was shouted in return.
<p/>And the door at the end of the gallery opened, and Mr. Rochester advanced with a candle: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had just descended from the upper storey.
<p/>'' Be composed, all of you: I'm coming. '' One of the ladies ran to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) directly; she (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) seized his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arm: it was Miss Ingram.
<p/>But don't pull me down or strangle me,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) replied: for the Misses Eshton were clinging about him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) now; and the two dowagers, in vast white wrappers, were bearing down on him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) like ships in full sail.
<p/>'' What awful event has taken place?'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>). '' Speak! let us know the worst at once!'' '' '' All's right!--all's right!
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) cried. '' It's a mere rehearsal of Much Ado about Nothing. Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.
<p/>'' And dangerous he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) looked: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) black eyes darted sparks. Calming himself by an effort, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) added-- <div class="bookquote">``A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) construed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) dream into an apparition, or something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.
<p/>Now, then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) cannot be looked after.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>)'s an excitable, nervous person: Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the ladies the example. Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors.
<p/>Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a pair of doves, as you are. Mesdames''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-to the dowagers-RRB- , <div class="bookquote">``you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer.
<p/>And so, by dint of alternate coaxing and commanding, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) contrived to get them all once more enclosed in their separate dormitories.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the dowagers</b></font>)</div>I did not wait to be ordered back to mine, but retreated unnoticed, as unnoticed I had left it. Not, however, to go to bed: on the contrary, I began and dressed myself carefully.
<p/>The sounds I had heard after the scream, and the words that had been uttered, had probably been heard only by me; for they had proceeded from the room above mine: but they assured me that it was not a servant's dream which had thus struck horror through the house; and that the explanation Mr. Rochester had given was merely an invention framed to pacify his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) guests.
<p/>When dressed, I sat a long time by the window looking out over the silent grounds and silvered fields and waiting for
<p/>I dressed, then, to be ready for emergencies. I knew not what. It seemed to me that some event must follow the strange cry, struggle, and call.
<p/>No: stillness returned: each murmur and movement ceased gradually, and in about an hour Thornfield Hall was again as hushed as a desert.
<p/>Not liking to sit in the cold and darkness, I thought I would lie down on my bed, dressed as I was.
<p/>I left the window, and moved with little noise across the carpet; as I stooped to take off my shoes, a cautious hand tapped low at the door.
<p/>It seemed that sleep and night had resumed their empire. Meantime the moon declined: she (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was about to set. '' Am I wanted?
<p/>'' I asked. '' Are you up? '' asked the voice I expected to hear, viz. , my master's. '' Yes, sir.''
<p/>'' And dressed?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Come out, then, quietly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I obeyed. Mr. Rochester stood in the gallery holding a light. ''
<p/>I want you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``come this way: take your time, and make no noise. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>My slippers were thin: I could walk the matted floor as softly as a cat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) glided up the gallery and up the stairs, and stopped in the dark, low corridor of the fateful third storey: I had followed and stood at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) side.
<p/>'' Have you a sponge in your room? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) asked in a whisper. '' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Have you any salts--volatile salts?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Go back and fetch both. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I returned, sought the sponge on the washstand, the salts in my drawer, and once more retraced my steps.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) still waited; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) held a key in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hand: approaching one of the small, black doors, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) put it in the lock; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) paused, and addressed me again.
<p/>'' You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?'' <div class="bookquote">``I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt a thrill while I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); but no coldness, and no faintness. '' Just give me your hand,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``it will not do to risk a fainting fit.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I put my fingers into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). '' Warm and steady,'' was his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) remark: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) turned the key and opened the door.
<p/>I saw a room I remembered to have seen before, the day Mrs. Fairfax showed me over the house: it was hung with tapestry; but the tapestry was now looped up in one part, and there was a door apparent, which had then been concealed.
<p/>This door was open; a light shone out of the room within: I heard thence a snarling, snatching sound, almost like a dog quarrelling.
<p/>Mr. Rochester, putting down his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) candle, said to me, <div class="bookquote">``Wait a minute,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) went forward to the inner apartment. A shout of laughter greeted his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) entrance; noisy at first, and terminating in Grace Poole's own goblin ha!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) made some sort of arrangement without speaking, though I heard a low voice address him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) came out and closed the door behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said; and I walked round to the other side of a large bed, which with its drawn curtains concealed a considerable portion of the chamber.
<p/>An easy-chair was near the bed-head: a man sat in it, dressed with the exception of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coat; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was still; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) head leant back; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes were closed.
<p/>ha! She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then was there. '' Here, Jane! '' Mr. Rochester held the candle over him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); I recognised in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) pale and seemingly lifeless face--the stranger, Mason:
<p/>I saw too that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) linen on one side, and one arm, was almost soaked in blood. '' Hold the candle,'' said Mr. Rochester, and I took it
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) took the sponge, dipped it in, and moistened the corpse-like face; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) asked for my smelling-bottle, and applied it to the nostrils.
<p/>: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) fetched a basin of water from the washstand: <div class="bookquote">``Hold that,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). I obeyed. Mr. Mason shortly unclosed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) eyes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) groaned.
<p/>Mr. Rochester opened the shirt of the wounded man, whose arm and shoulder were bandaged: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sponged away blood, trickling fast down.
<p/>'' Is there immediate danger? '' murmured Mr. Mason. '' Pooh! No--a mere scratch. Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!
<p/>I'll fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by morning, I hope. Jane,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) continued.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns: if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lips, and your salts to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nose.
<p/>You will not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on any pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>): open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the consequences.
<p/>Again the poor man groaned; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) dared not move; fear, either of death or of something else, appeared almost to paralyse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sir?'' '' Mr. Rochester put the now bloody sponge into my hand, and I proceeded to use it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had done.
<p/>I experienced a strange feeling as the key grated in the lock, and the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) retreating step ceased to be heard.
<p/>Here then I was in the third storey, fastened into one of its mystic cells; night around me; a pale and bloody spectacle under my eyes and hands; a murderess hardly separated from me by a single door: yes--that was appalling--the rest I could bear; but I shuddered at the thought of Grace Poole bursting out upon me.
<p/>I must watch this ghastly countenance--these blue, still lips forbidden to unclose--these eyes now shut, now opening, now wandering through the room, now fixing on me, and ever glazed with the dulness of horror.
<p/>I must dip my hand again and again in the basin of blood and water, and wipe away the trickling gore.
<p/>I must see the light of the unsnuffed candle wane on my employment; the shadows darken on the wrought, antique tapestry round me, and grow black under the hangings of the vast old bed, and quiver strangely over the doors of a great cabinet opposite--whose front, divided into twelve panels, bore, in grim design, the heads of the twelve apostles, each enclosed in its separate panel as in a frame; while above them at the top rose an ebon crucifix and a dying Christ.
<p/>According as the shifting obscurity and flickering gleam hovered here or glanced there, it was now the bearded physician, Luke, that bent his (<font color='blue'><b>Luke</b></font>) brow; now St. John's long hair that waved; and anon the devilish face of Judas, that grew out of the panel, and seemed gathering life and threatening a revelation of the arch-traitor--of Satan himself--in his (<font color='blue'><b>Satan</b></font>) subordinate's form.
<p/>Amidst all this, I had to listen as well as watch: to listen for the movements of the wild beast or the fiend in yonder side den.
<p/>But since Mr. Rochester's visit it seemed spellbound: all the night I heard but three sounds at three long intervals,--a step creak, a momentary renewal of the snarling, canine noise, and a deep human groan.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) watched me a second, then saying, <div class="bookquote">``Remember!--No conversation,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) left the room. I must keep to my post, however. Then my own thoughts worried me.
<p/>What crime was this that lived incarnate in this sequestered mansion, and could neither be expelled nor subdued by the owner?--what mystery, that broke out now in fire and now in blood, at the deadest hours of night?
<p/>What creature was it, that, masked in an ordinary woman's face and shape, uttered the voice, now of a mocking demon, and anon of a carrion-seeking bird of prey?
<p/>And this man I bent over--this commonplace, quiet stranger--how had he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) become involved in the web of horror? and why had the Fury flown at him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)?
<p/>What made him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) seek this quarter of the house at an untimely season, when he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) should have been asleep in bed?
<p/>I had heard Mr. Rochester assign him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) an apartment below--what brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) here! And why, now, was he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) so tame under the violence or treachery done him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)?
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) guest had been outraged, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) own life on a former occasion had been hideously plotted against; and both attempts he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) smothered in secrecy and sank in oblivion!
<p/>Lastly, I saw Mr. Mason was submissive to Mr. Rochester; that the impetuous will of the latter held complete sway over the inertness of the former: the few words which had passed between them assured me of this.
<p/>It was evident that in their former intercourse, the passive disposition of the one had been habitually influenced by the active energy of the other:
<p/>Why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) so quietly submit to the concealment Mr. Rochester enforced? Why did Mr. Rochester enforce this concealment? whence then had arisen Mr. Rochester's dismay when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) heard of Mr. Mason's arrival?
<p/>Why had the mere name of this unresisting individual--whom his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) word now sufficed to control like a child--fallen on him (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>), a few hours since, as a thunderbolt might fall on an oak?
<p/>I could not forget his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) look and his (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) paleness when he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) whispered: <div class="bookquote">``Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane.
<p/>I could not forget how the arm had trembled which he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) rested on my shoulder: and it was no light matter which could thus bow the resolute spirit and thrill the vigorous frame of Fairfax Rochester.
<p/>I cried inwardly, as the night lingered and lingered--as my bleeding patient drooped, moaned, sickened: and neither day nor aid arrived.
<p/>I had, again and again, held the water to Mason's white lips; again and again offered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) the stimulating salts: my efforts seemed ineffectual: either bodily or mental suffering, or loss of blood, or all three combined, were fast prostrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) strength.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) moaned so, and looked so weak, wild, and lost, I feared he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was dying; and I might not even speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>).
<p/>The candle, wasted at last, went out; as it expired, I perceived streaks of grey light edging the window curtains: dawn was then approaching.
<p/>Oh! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' When will he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) come? When will he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) come? '' Presently I heard Pilot bark far below, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) distant kennel in the courtyard: hope revived.
<p/>Nor was it unwarranted: in five minutes more the grating key, the yielding lock, warned me my watch was relieved. It could not have lasted more than two hours: many a week has seemed shorter.
<p/>Now, Carter, be on the alert,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) said to this last: <div class="bookquote">``I give you but half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the patient downstairs and all.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Rochester entered, and with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) the surgeon he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had been to fetch. '' '' But is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) fit to move, sir?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is nervous, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) spirits must be kept up. Come, set to work.
<p/>Mr. Rochester drew back the thick curtain, drew up the holland blind, let in all the daylight he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) could; and I was surprised and cheered to see how far dawn was advanced: what rosy streaks were beginning to brighten the east.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) approached Mason, whom the surgeon was already handling. '' Now, my good fellow, how are you?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) asked.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)'s done for me, I fear,'' was the faint reply. '' Not a whit!--courage! This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.
<p/>Carter, assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) there's no danger.'' <div class="bookquote">``I can do that conscientiously,''  (<font color='red'><b>Carter/Mr. Carter</b></font>)</div>said Carter, who had now undone the bandages; <div class="bookquote">``only I wish I could have got here sooner: he (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) would not have bled so much--but how is this?
<p/>The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well as cut. This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth here!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Carter/Mr. Carter</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bit me,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) murmured. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) worried me like a tigress, when Rochester got the knife from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).'' <div class="bookquote">``You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at once,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Rochester.
<p/>'' But under such circumstances, what could one do? '' returned Mason. '' Oh, it was frightful! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) added, shuddering.
<p/>'' And I did not expect it: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked so quiet at first. '' <div class="bookquote">``I warned you,''  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) friend's answer; <div class="bookquote">``I said--be on your guard when you go near her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and alone.''
 (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought I could have done some good. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You thought! you thought! Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you:
<p/>but, however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not taking my advice; so I'll say no more.
<p/>Carter--hurry!--hurry! The sun will soon rise, and I must have him (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) off.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged. I must look to this other wound in the arm: she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has had her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) teeth here too, I think.
<p/>I saw Mr. Rochester shudder: a singularly marked expression of disgust, horror, hatred, warped his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) countenance almost to distortion; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) only said-- <div class="bookquote">``Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gibberish: don't repeat it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sucked the blood: she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'d drain my heart,'' said Mason. <div class="bookquote">``I wish I could forget it,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer.
<p/>You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish Town, you may think of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as dead and buried--or rather, you need not think of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) at all.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Impossible to forget this night!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is not impossible: have some energy, man. You thought you were as dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now.
<p/>Jane''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) turned to me for the first time since his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) re-entrance-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble.
<p/>There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a trice. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I went; sought the repository he (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) had mentioned, found the articles named, and returned with them.
<p/>Now,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``go to the other side of the bed while I order his (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' I retired as directed. '' Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane? '' inquired Mr. Rochester presently.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No, sir; all was very still.'' I have striven long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.
<p/>Here, Carter, help him (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) waist-coat. Where did you leave your furred cloak? You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold climate.
<p/>In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there. '' Again I ran, and again returned, bearing an immense mantle lined and edged with fur.
<p/>'' Now, I've another errand for you,'' said my untiring master; <div class="bookquote">``you must away to my room again. What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.
<p/>You must open the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a little glass you will find there,--quick!''
 (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div><p/>I flew thither and back, bringing the desired vessels. '' That's well! Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a dose myself, on my own responsibility.
<p/>I got this cordial at Rome, of an Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter. It is not a thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now, for instance.
<p/>Jane, a little water. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) held out the tiny glass, and I half filled it from the water-bottle on the washstand.
<p/>'' That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial. '' I did so; he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) measured twelve drops of a crimson liquid, and presented it to Mason.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' But will it hurt me?--is
<p/>it inflammatory?'' <div class="bookquote">``Drink! drink! drink! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mason/Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div>Mr. Mason obeyed, because it was evidently useless to resist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was dressed now: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) still looked pale, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was no longer gory and sullied.
<p/>Mr. Rochester let him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sit three minutes after he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had swallowed the liquid; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) then took his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arm-- '' Now I am sure you can get on your feet,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said--<div class="bookquote">``try.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The patient rose. '' Carter, take him (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) under the other shoulder. Be of good cheer, Richard; step out--that's it!'' <div class="bookquote">``I do feel better,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mason/Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div>remarked Mr. Mason.
<p/>Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs; unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) not to drive his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.
<p/>It was by this time half-past five, and the sun was on the point of rising; but I found the kitchen still dark and silent.
<p/>'' I am sure you do. '' The side-passage door was fastened; I opened it with as little noise as possible:
<p/>all the yard was quiet; but the gates stood wide open, and there was a post-chaise, with horses ready harnessed, and driver seated on the box, stationed outside.
<p/>The stillness of early morning slumbered everywhere; the curtains were yet drawn over the servants' chamber windows; little birds were just twittering in the blossom-blanched orchard trees, whose boughs drooped like white garlands over the wall enclosing one side of the yard; the carriage horses stamped from time to time in their closed stables: all else was still.
<p/>I approached him (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>), and said the gentlemen were coming; he (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) nodded: then I looked carefully round and listened. The gentlemen now appeared.
<p/>Mason, supported by Mr. Rochester and the surgeon, seemed to walk with tolerable ease: they assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) into the chaise; Carter followed.
<p/>Take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>),'' said Mr. Rochester to the latter, <div class="bookquote">``and keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) at your house till he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) gets on.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>Richard, how is it with you?'' '' The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.'' <div class="bookquote">``Leave the window open on his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye, Dick.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) be taken care of; let her (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) be treated as tenderly as may be: let her (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) stopped and burst into tears.
<p/>I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,'' was the answer: he (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) shut up the chaise door, and the vehicle drove away.
<p/>Yet would to God there was an end of all this!'' added Mr. Rochester, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) closed and barred the heavy yard-gates.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Fairfax--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well what is it?'' '' '' This done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) moved with slow step and abstracted air towards a door in the wall bordering the orchard.
<p/>I, supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had done with me, prepared to return to the house; again, however, I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) call <div class="bookquote">``Jane!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had opened the portal and stood at it, waiting for me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``that house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``and you see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.'' '' Now here '' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) pointed to the leafy enclosure we had entered-RRB-
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) strayed down a walk edged with box, with apple trees, pear trees, and cherry trees on one side, and a border on the other full of all sorts of old-fashioned flowers, stocks, sweet-williams, primroses, pansies, mingled with southernwood, sweet-briar, and various fragrant herbs.
<p/>They were fresh now as a succession of April showers and gleams, followed by a lovely spring morning, could make them: the sun was just entering the dappled east, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) light illumined the wreathed and dewy orchard trees and shone down the quiet walks under them.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``all is real, sweet, and pure. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div>'' Jane, will you have a flower?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) gathered a half-blown rose, the first on the bush, and offered it to me.
<p/>That sky with its high and light clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly atmosphere?
<p/>'' Thank you, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Do you like this sunrise, Jane? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do, very much.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have passed a strange night, Jane.''

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>)--put the thing out of your thoughts.''
<p/>'' Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) stays. '' <div class="bookquote">``Never fear--I will take care of myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.
<p/>To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and spue fire any day.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mason/Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div>'' But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.
<p/>Your influence, sir, is evidently potent with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure you.'' '' Oh, no!
<p/>Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) hurt me--but, unintentionally, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) to be cautious, sir: let him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) know what you fear, and show him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) how to avert the danger. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) laughed sardonically, hastily took my hand, and as hastily threw it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>). '' If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?
<p/>Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) `Do that,' and the thing has been done.
<p/>But I cannot give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) orders in this case: I cannot say `Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is imperative that I should keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) ignorant that harm to me is possible.
<p/>Annihilated in a moment. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further. You are my little friend, are you not?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Precisely: I see you do.

<p/>My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale, and would say, `No, sir; that is impossible : I cannot do it, because it is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.
<p/>I dare not show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix me at once.
<p/>Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mason/Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div>'' If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir, you are very safe.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God grant it may be so! Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The arbour was an arch in the wall, lined with ivy; it contained a rustic seat.
<p/>Mr. Rochester took it, leaving room, however, for me: but I stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). '' Sit,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``the bench is long enough for two.
<p/>You don't hesitate to take a place at my side, do you? Is that wrong, Jane? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) by assuming it: to refuse would, I felt, have been unwise.
<p/>Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying.
<p/>you were no longer a girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you there commit a capital error,
<p/>no matter of what nature or from what motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and taint all your existence.
<p/>Mind, I don't say a crime ; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is error .
<p/>The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor culpable.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``No, sir; I am content. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div>'' Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very confines of life:
<p/>Bitter and base associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless, sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling.
<p/>Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.
<p/>Such society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.
<p/>To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your judgment approves?
<p/>your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel will not leave it till the time of setting. ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) paused for an answer: and what was I to say? Oh, for some good spirit to suggest a judicious and satisfactory response!
<p/>The west wind whispered in the ivy round me; but no gentle Ariel borrowed its breath as a medium of speech: the birds sang in the tree-tops; but their song, however sweet, was inarticulate.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own peace of mind and regeneration of life?''

<p/>CHAPTER XXI Presentiments are strange things! I never laughed at presentiments in my life, because I have had strange ones of my own.
<p/>Sympathies, I believe, exist -LRB-for instance, between far-distant, long-absent, wholly estranged relatives asserting, notwithstanding their alienation, the unity of the source to which each traces his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) origin-RRB- whose workings baffle mortal comprehension.
<p/>When I was a little girl, only six years old, I one night heard Bessie Leaven say to Martha Abbot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Leaven</b></font>) had been dreaming about a little child; and that to dream of children was a sure sign of trouble, either to one's self or one's kin.
<p/>The saying might have worn out of my memory, had not a circumstance immediately followed which served indelibly to fix it there.
<p/>And signs, for aught we know, may be but the sympathies of Nature with man. The next day Bessie was sent for home to the deathbed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) little sister.
<p/>Of late I had often recalled this saying and this incident; for during the past week scarcely a night had gone over my couch that had not brought with it a dream of an infant, which I sometimes hushed in my arms, sometimes dandled on my knee, sometimes watched playing with daisies on a lawn, or again, dabbling its hands in running water.
<p/>It was a wailing child this night, and a laughing one the next: now it nestled close to me, and now it ran from me; but whatever mood the apparition evinced, whatever aspect it wore, it failed not for seven successive nights to meet me the moment I entered the land of slumber.
<p/>I did not like this iteration of one idea--this strange recurrence of one image, and I grew nervous as bedtime approached and the hour of the vision drew near.
<p/>It was from companionship with this baby-phantom I had been roused on that moonlight night when I heard the cry; and it was on the afternoon of the day following
<p/>On repairing thither, I found a man waiting for me, having the appearance of a gentleman's servant: he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was dressed in deep mourning, and the hat he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hand was surrounded with a crape band.
<p/>I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) said, rising as I entered; <div class="bookquote">``but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I was summoned downstairs by a message that some one wanted me in Mrs. Fairfax's room. '' '' Oh, Robert! how do you do?
<p/>I remember you very well : you used to give me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony. And how is Bessie?
<p/>You are married to Bessie?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you ; she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brought me another little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and child are thriving.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the family Robert</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And are the family well at the house, Robert?'' ``I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very badly at present--in great trouble.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) too looked down at the crape round his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) hat and replied-- <div class="bookquote">``Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chambers in London.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I hope no one is dead,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, glancing at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) black dress. <div class="bookquote">``Mr. John?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>'' And how does his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother bear it?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) life has been very wild: these last three years he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gave himself up to strange ways, and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) death was shocking.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I heard from Bessie he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was not doing well.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Doing well! He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could not do worse: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) health and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) estate amongst the worst men and the worst women.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) got into debt and into jail: his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mother helped him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) out twice, but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was free he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) old companions and habits.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head was not strong: the knaves he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lived amongst fooled him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) beyond anything I ever heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>Missis refused: her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) means have long been much reduced by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) extravagance; so he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went back again, and the next news was that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was dead.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had got very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) down.
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) died, God knows!--they say he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) killed himself. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was silent: the things were frightful. Robert Leaven resumed-- The information about Mr. John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) seemed rather better : she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) appeared as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling.
<p/>It was only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was pronouncing your name; and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) made out the words, `Bring Jane--
<p/>Bessie is not sure whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) is in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) right mind, or means anything by the words; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised them to send for you.
<p/>The young ladies put it off at first; but their mother grew so restless, and said, `Jane, Jane,' so many times, that at last they consented.
<p/>I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow morning.''
<p/>fetch Jane Eyre : I want to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>).' <div class="bookquote">``Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss.. Bessie said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was sure you would not refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?
<p/>Yes; and I will do it now;'' and having directed him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to the servants' hall, and recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) to the care of John's wife, and the attentions of John himself, I went in search of Mr. Rochester.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think so too, ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was not in any of the lower rooms; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was not in the yard, the stables, or the grounds.
<p/>To the billiard- room I hastened: the click of balls and the hum of voices resounded thence; Mr. Rochester, Miss Ingram, the two Misses Eshton, and their admirers, were all busied in the game.
<p/>It required some courage to disturb so interesting a party; my errand, however, was one I could not defer, so I approached the master where he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) stood at Miss Ingram's side.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) turned as I drew near, and looked at me haughtily: her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) eyes seemed to demand, ``What can the creeping creature want now?
<p/>and when I said, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">``Mr. Rochester,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) made a movement as if tempted to order me away.
<p/>I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) appearance at the moment--it was very graceful and very striking: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) wore a morning robe of sky-blue crape; a gauzy azure scarf was twisted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) hair.
<p/>I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>);--yes: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was playing billiards with Miss Ingram. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had been all animation with the game, and irritated pride did not lower the expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) haughty lineaments.
<p/>'' Does that person want you? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) inquired of Mr. Rochester; and Mr. Rochester turned to see who the <div class="bookquote">``person''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>was.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) made a curious grimace--one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) strange and equivocal demonstrations--threw down his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) cue and followed me from the room. ''
<p/>Well, Jane? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) rested his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) back against the schoolroom door, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had shut. '' If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``What to do?--where to go?''  (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>'' To see a sick lady who has sent for me. '' <div class="bookquote">``What sick lady?--where does she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) live?''

<p/>'' Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed. '' <div class="bookquote">``Reed of Gateshead? There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) widow, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And what have you to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)? How do you know her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>)?'' '' Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother.''
<p/>'' The deuce he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was! You never told me that before: you always said you had no relations.'' '' None that would own me, sir.
<p/>Mr. Reed is dead, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) wife cast me off. '' <div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) disliked me.''
<p/>Sir George Lynn was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) said, was one of the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of the same place, who was much admired for her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) beauty a season or two ago in London.''
<p/>'' But Reed left children?--you must have cousins? <div class="bookquote">``John Reed is dead, too, sir: he (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) ruined himself and half-ruined his (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.

<p/>Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) circumstances were very different: I could not be easy to neglect her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wishes now.

<p/>I drew out my purse; a meagre thing it was. '' Five shillings, sir.

<p/>Soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) pocket-book: <div class="bookquote">``Here,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), offering me a note; it was fifty pounds, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) owed me but fifteen.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) scowled at first; then, as if recollecting something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said-- <div class="bookquote">``Right, right! Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three months if you had fifty pounds.
<p/>There are ten; is it not plenty?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.'' <div class="bookquote">``Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.''

''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked myself; <div class="bookquote">``I want to commence my packing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The dinner-bell rang, and suddenly away he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) bolted, without another syllable : I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) no more during the day, and was off before he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had risen in the morning.
<p/>I reached the lodge at Gateshead about five o'clock in the afternoon of the first of May: I stepped in there before going up to the hall.
<p/>It was very clean and neat: the ornamental windows were hung with little white curtains; the floor was spotless; the grate and fire-irons were burnished bright, and the fire burnt clear.
<p/>Bessie sat on the hearth, nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) last-born, and Robert and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) sister played quietly in a corner. '' Bless you!--I knew you would come!
<p/>'' exclaimed Mrs. Leaven, as I entered. '' Yes, Bessie,'' said I, after I had kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and I trust I am not too late.
<p/>How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope.

The doctor says she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) may linger a week or two yet; but he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) hardly thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) will finally recover.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the house.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) mentioned me lately?''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and wakes up about six or seven.
<p/>Robert here entered, and Bessie laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) sleeping child in the cradle and went to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>): afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) insisted on my taking off my bonnet and having some tea; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) said I looked pale and tired.
<p/>I was glad to accept her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) hospitality; and I submitted to be relieved of my travelling garb just as passively as I used to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) undress me when a child.
<p/>Old times crowded fast back on me as I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) bustling about--setting out the tea-tray with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) best china, cutting bread and butter, toasting a tea-cake, and, between whiles, giving little Robert or Jane an occasional tap or push, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) used to give me in former days.
<p/>Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with you? '' Bessie had retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) quick temper as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) light foot and good looks.
<p/>Tea ready, I was going to approach the table; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) desired me to sit still, quite in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) old peremptory tones.
<p/>I must be served at the fireside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) said; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) placed before me a little round stand with my cup and a plate of toast, absolutely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) used to accommodate me with some privately purloined dainty on a nursery chair: and I smiled and obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) as in bygone days.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) wanted to know if I was happy at Thornfield Hall, and what sort of a person the mistress was; and when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) there was only a master, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was a nice gentleman, and if I liked him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).
<p/>I told her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was rather an ugly man, but quite a gentleman; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) treated me kindly, and I was content.
<p/>Then I went on to describe to her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) the gay company that had lately been staying at the house; and to these details Bessie listened with interest: they were precisely of the kind she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) relished.
<p/>In such conversation an hour was soon gone: Bessie restored to me my bonnet, &c., and, accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>), I quitted the lodge for the hall.
<p/>It was also accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) that I had, nearly nine years ago, walked down the path I was now ascending.
<p/>On a dark, misty, raw morning in January, I had left a hostile roof with a desperate and embittered heart--a sense of outlawry and almost of reprobation--to seek the chilly harbourage of Lowood: that bourne so far away and unexplored.
<p/>The same hostile roof now again rose before me: my prospects were doubtful yet; and I had yet an aching heart.
<p/>I still felt as a wanderer on the face of the earth; but I experienced firmer trust in myself and my own powers, and less withering dread of oppression.
<p/>You shall go into the breakfast-room first,'' said Bessie, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) preceded me through the hall; <div class="bookquote">``the young ladies will be there.
<p/>The gaping wound of my wrongs, too, was now quite healed; and the flame of resentment extinguished. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' In another moment I was within that apartment.
<p/>There was every article of furniture looking just as it did on the morning I was first introduced to Mr. Brocklehurst: the very rug he (<font color='blue'><b>Brocklehurst</b></font>) had stood upon still covered the hearth.
<p/>Glancing at the bookcases, I thought I could distinguish the two volumes of Bewick's British Birds occupying their old place on the third shelf, and Gulliver's Travels and the Arabian Nights ranged just above.
<p/>Two young ladies appeared before me; one very tall, almost as tall as Miss Ingram--very thin too, with a sallow face and severe mien.
<p/>There was something ascetic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) look, which was augmented by the extreme plainness of a straight-skirted, black, stuff dress, a starched linen collar, hair combed away from the temples, and the nun-like ornament of a string of ebony beads and a crucifix.
<p/>This I felt sure was Eliza, though I could trace little resemblance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) former self in that elongated and colourless visage.
<p/>The inanimate objects were not changed; but the living things had altered past recognition. The other was as certainly Georgiana: but not the Georgiana I remembered--the slim and fairy-like girl of eleven.
<p/>This was a full-blown, very plump damsel, fair as waxwork, with handsome and regular features, languishing blue eyes, and ringleted yellow hair.
<p/>The hue of her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) dress was black too; but its fashion was so different from her (<font color='blue'><b>damsel</b></font>) sister's--so much more flowing and becoming--it looked as stylish as the other's looked puritanical.
<p/>In each of the sisters there was one trait of the mother--and only one; the thin and pallid elder daughter had her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) parent's Cairngorm eye: the blooming and luxuriant younger girl had her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) contour of jaw and chin--perhaps a little softened, but still imparting an indescribable hardness to the countenance otherwise so voluptuous and buxom.
<p/>Eliza's greeting was delivered in a short, abrupt voice, without a smile; and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) sat down again, fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) eyes on the fire, and seemed to forget me.
<p/>Georgiana added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``How d'ye do?''  (<font color='red'><b>Georgiana/Georgiana Reed</b></font>)</div>several commonplaces about my journey, the weather, and so on, uttered in rather a drawling tone: and accompanied by sundry side-glances that measured me from head to foot--now traversing the folds of my drab merino pelisse, and now lingering on the plain trimming of my cottage bonnet.
<p/>Young ladies have a remarkable way of letting you know that they think you a <div class="bookquote">``quiz''  (<font color='red'><b>Young ladies</b></font>)</div>without actually saying the words.
<p/>A certain superciliousness of look, coolness of manner, nonchalance of tone, express fully their sentiments on the point, without committing them by any positive rudeness in word or deed.
<p/>A sneer, however, whether covert or open, had now no longer that power over me it once possessed: as I sat between my cousins, I was surprised to find how easy I felt under the total neglect of the one and the semi- sarcastic attentions of the other--Eliza did not mortify, nor Georgiana ruffle me.
<p/>The fact was, I had other things to think about; within the last few months feelings had been stirred in me so much more potent than any they could raise--pains and pleasures so much more acute and exquisite had been excited than any it was in their power to inflict or bestow--that their airs gave me no concern either for good or bad.
<p/>Both ladies, as I advanced, rose to welcome me, and both addressed me by the name of <div class="bookquote">``Miss Eyre. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>I asked soon, looking calmly at Georgiana, who thought fit to bridle at the direct address, as if it were an unexpected liberty. ''
<p/>How is Mrs. Reed? '' Mrs. Reed? Ah! mama, you mean; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) is extremely poorly : I doubt if you can see her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) to-night.''
<p/>If,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``you would just step upstairs and tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) I am come, I should be much obliged to you.
<p/>I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) had a particular wish to see me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I added, <div class="bookquote">``and I would not defer attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) desire longer than is absolutely necessary.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Georgiana almost started, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) blue eyes wild and wide. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>Eliza</b></font>)</div>remarked Eliza.
<p/>I soon rose, quietly took off my bonnet and gloves, uninvited, and said I would just step out to Bessie--who was, I dared say, in the kitchen--and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) to ascertain whether Mrs. Reed was disposed to receive me or not to- night.
<p/>It had heretofore been my habit always to shrink from arrogance: received as I had been to-day, I should, a year ago, have resolved to quit Gateshead the very next morning; now, it was disclosed to me all at once that that would be a foolish plan.
<p/>I had taken a journey of a hundred miles to see my aunt, and I must stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was better--or dead: as to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) daughters' pride or folly, I must put it on one side, make myself independent of it.
<p/>So I addressed the housekeeper; asked her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) to show me a room, told her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) I should probably be a visitor here for a week or two, had my trunk conveyed to my chamber, and followed it thither myself: I met Bessie on the landing.
<p/>I went, and having found Bessie and despatched her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) on my errand, I proceeded to take further measures. '' Missis is awake,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>);
<p/>I did not need to be guided to the well-known room, to which I had so often been summoned for chastisement or reprimand in former days.
<p/>I hastened before Bessie; I softly opened the door: a shaded light stood on the table, for it was now getting dark.
<p/>There was the great four-post bed with amber hangings as of old; there the toilet-table, the armchair, and the footstool, at which I had a hundred times been sentenced to kneel, to ask pardon for offences by me uncommitted.
<p/>I looked into a certain corner near, half-expecting to see the slim outline of a once dreaded switch which used to lurk there, waiting to leap out imp-like and lace my quivering palm or shrinking neck.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) you are here: come and let us see if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will know you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I approached the bed; I opened the curtains and leant over the high-piled pillows.
<p/>Well did I remember Mrs. Reed's face, and I eagerly sought the familiar image. It is a happy thing that time quells the longings of vengeance and hushes the promptings of rage and aversion.
<p/>I had left this woman in bitterness and hate, and I came back to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) now with no other emotion than a sort of ruth for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) great sufferings, and a strong yearning to forget and forgive all injuries--to be reconciled and clasp hands in amity.
<p/>The well-known face was there: stern, relentless as ever--there was that peculiar eye which nothing could melt, and the somewhat raised, imperious, despotic eyebrow.
<p/>How often had it lowered on me menace and hate! and how the recollection of childhood's terrors and sorrows revived as I traced its harsh line now!
<p/>And yet I stooped down and kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at me. <div class="bookquote">``Is this Jane Eyre? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) said. '' Yes, Aunt Reed.
<p/>I had once vowed that I would never call her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) aunt again: I thought it no sin to forget and break that vow now.
<p/>My fingers had fastened on her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) hand which lay outside the sheet: had she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) pressed mine kindly, I should at that moment have experienced true pleasure.
<p/>How are you, dear aunt? '' But unimpressionable natures are not so soon softened, nor are natural antipathies so readily eradicated.
<p/>Mrs. Reed took her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) hand away, and, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) face rather from me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) remarked that the night was warm. Again she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) regarded me so icily
<p/>I knew by her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) stony eye--opaque to tenderness, indissoluble to tears--that she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) was resolved to consider me bad to the last; because to believe me good would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) no generous pleasure: only a sense of mortification.
<p/>I felt pain, and then I felt ire; and then I felt a determination to subdue her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>)--to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) mistress in spite both of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) nature and her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) will.
<p/>, I felt at once that her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) opinion of me--her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) feeling towards me--was unchanged and unchangeable. My tears had risen, just as in childhood: I ordered them back to their source.
<p/>You sent for me,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``and I am here; and it is my intention to stay till I see how you get on.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I brought a chair to the bed-head: I sat down and leaned over the pillow. '' '' Oh, of course! You have seen my daughters?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over with you
<p/>I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a difficulty in recalling them. But there was something I wished to say--let me see--''
<p/>Turning restlessly, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) drew the bedclothes round her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); my elbow, resting on a corner of the quilt, fixed it down: she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was at once irritated.
<p/>The wandering look and changed utterance told what wreck had taken place in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) once vigorous frame. <div class="bookquote">``Sit up!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.
<p/>Are you Jane Eyre?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am Jane Eyre. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.
<p/>Such a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) caused me, daily and hourly, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) incomprehensible disposition, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) sudden starts of temper, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) continual, unnatural watchings of one's movements!
<p/>I declare she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) talked to me once like something mad, or like a fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) did; I was glad to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) away from the house.
<p/>What did they do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) at Lowood? The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>), however, did not die: but I said she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) did--I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) had died!''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I had a dislike to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) mother always; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) was my husband's only sister, and a great favourite with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opposed the family's disowning her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) low marriage; and when news came of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) death, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wept like a simpleton.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would send for the baby; though I entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) so?'' I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing!
<p/>It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning. Reed pitied it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own:
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was angry with them when they showed their dislike.
<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last illness, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had it brought continually to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bedside; and but an hour before he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) died, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bound me by vow to keep the creature.
<p/>I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) was weak, naturally weak.
<p/>more, indeed, than he (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) ever noticed his (<font color='blue'><b>brat</b></font>) own at that age. John does not at all resemble his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father, and I am glad of it
<p/>: John is like me and like my brothers--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is quite a Gibson. Oh, I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would cease tormenting me with letters for money?
<p/>I have no more money to give him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>): we are getting poor. I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.
<p/>I can never submit to do that--yet how are we to get on? Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded--his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) when I see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>I think I had better leave her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now,'' said I to Bessie, who stood on the other side of the bed.
<p/>John gambles dreadfully, and always loses--poor boy! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was getting much excited. '' '' Perhaps you had, Miss: but she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) often talks in this way towards night--in the morning she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is calmer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) threatens me--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) continually threatens me with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) laid out with a great wound in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.
<p/>'' I rose. <div class="bookquote">``Stop! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mrs. Reed, <div class="bookquote">``there is another thing I wished to say. I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles.
<p/>What is to be done? How is the money to be had? ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>Bessie now endeavoured to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) to take a sedative draught: she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) succeeded with difficulty.
<p/>Soon after, Mrs. Reed grew more composed, and sank into a dozing state. I then left her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>). More than ten days elapsed before I had again any conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>).
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) continued either delirious or lethargic; and the doctor forbade everything which could painfully excite her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>). Meantime, I got on as well as I could with Georgiana and Eliza.
<p/>Eliza would sit half the day sewing, reading, or writing, and scarcely utter a word either to me or her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) sister.
<p/>They were very cold, indeed, at first. Georgiana would chatter nonsense to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) canary bird by the hour, and take no notice of me.
<p/>But I was determined not to seem at a loss for occupation or amusement: I had brought my drawing materials with me, and they served me for both.
<p/>Provided with a case of pencils, and some sheets of paper, I used to take a seat apart from them, near the window, and busy myself in sketching fancy vignettes, representing any scene that happened momentarily to shape itself in the ever-shifting kaleidoscope of imagination: a glimpse of sea between two rocks; the rising moon, and a ship crossing its disk; a group of reeds and water-flags, and a naiad's head, crowned with lotus- flowers, rising out of them; an elf sitting in a hedge-sparrow's nest, under a wreath of hawthorn-bloom.
<p/>One morning I fell to sketching a face: what sort of a face it was to be, I did not care or know.
<p/>Soon I had traced on the paper a broad and prominent forehead and a square lower outline of visage: that contour gave me pleasure; my fingers proceeded actively to fill it with features.
<p/>Strongly-marked horizontal eyebrows must be traced under that brow; then followed, naturally, a well-defined nose, with a straight ridge and full nostrils; then a flexible-looking mouth, by no means narrow; then a firm chin, with a decided cleft down the middle of it: of course, some black whiskers were wanted, and some jetty hair, tufted on the temples, and waved above the forehead.
<p/>I took a soft black pencil, gave it a broad point, and worked away. Now for the eyes: I had left them to the last, because they required the most careful working.
<p/>I drew them large; I shaped them well: the eyelashes I traced long and sombre; the irids lustrous and large. ''
<p/>: <div class="bookquote">``they want more force and spirit;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I wrought the shades blacker, that the lights might flash more brilliantly--a happy touch or two secured success.
<p/>There, I had a friend's face under my gaze; and what did it signify that those young ladies turned their backs on me?
<p/>Good! but not quite the thing,'' I thought, as I surveyed the effect I looked at it; I smiled at the speaking likeness: I was absorbed and content.
<p/>'' Is that a portrait of some one you know? '' asked Eliza, who had approached me unnoticed. I responded that it was merely a fancy head, and hurried it beneath the other sheets.
<p/>Of course, I lied: it was, in fact, a very faithful representation of Mr. Rochester. But what was that to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), or to any one but myself?
<p/>Georgiana also advanced to look. The other drawings pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) much, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) called that <div class="bookquote">``an ugly man. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They both seemed surprised at my skill.
<p/>I offered to sketch their portraits; and each, in turn, sat for a pencil outline. Then Georgiana produced her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) album. I promised to contribute a water-colour drawing: this put her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) at once into good humour.
<p/>Before we had been out two hours, we were deep in a confidential conversation: she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had favoured me with a description of the brilliant winter she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had spent in London two seasons ago--of the admiration she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had there excited--the attention she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had received; and I even got hints of the titled conquest she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had made.
<p/>In the course of the afternoon and evening these hints were enlarged on: various soft conversations were reported, and sentimental scenes represented; and, in short, a volume of a novel of fashionable life was that day improvised by her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) for my benefit.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) proposed a walk in the grounds. The communications were renewed from day to day: they always ran on the same theme--herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) loves, and woes.
<p/>It was strange she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) never once adverted either to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother's illness, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) brother's death, or the present gloomy state of the family prospects.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mind seemed wholly taken up with reminiscences of past gaiety, and aspirations after dissipations to come. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) passed about five minutes each day in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother's sick-room, and no more.
<p/>I never saw a busier person than she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) seemed to be; yet it was difficult to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) did: or rather, to discover any result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) diligence.
<p/>I know not how she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) occupied herself before breakfast, but after that meal she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) divided her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) time into regular portions, and each hour had its allotted task.
<p/>Eliza still spoke little: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had evidently no time to talk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had an alarm to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) up early. Three times a day she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) studied a little book, which I found, on inspection, was a Common Prayer Book.
<p/>Three hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) gave to stitching, with gold thread, the border of a square crimson cloth, almost large enough for a carpet.
<p/>In answer to my inquiries after the use of this article, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) informed me it was a covering for the altar of a new church lately erected near Gateshead.
<p/>Two hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) diary; two to working by herself in the kitchen-garden; and one to the regulation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) accounts.
<p/>I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) once what was the great attraction of that volume, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``the Rubric. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) seemed to want no company;
<p/>I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) way: this routine sufficed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>); and nothing annoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) so much as the occurrence of any incident which forced her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to vary its clockwork regularity.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) told me one evening, when more disposed to be communicative than usual, that John's conduct, and the threatened ruin of the family, had been a source of profound affliction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>): but she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said, settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mind, and formed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) resolution.
<p/>, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) tranquilly remarked, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) should either recover or linger long--she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) would execute a long-cherished project: seek a retirement where punctual habits would be permanently secured from disturbance, and place safe barriers between herself and a frivolous world.
<p/>no conversation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own fortune she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had taken care to secure; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) mother died--and it was wholly improbable I asked if Georgiana would accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>).
<p/>'' Of course not. Georgiana and she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) had nothing in common: they never had had. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) would not be burdened with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) society for any consideration.
<p/>Georgiana, when not unburdening her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) heart to me, spent most of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) time in lying on the sofa, fretting about the dulness of the house, and wishing over and over again that her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) aunt Gibson would send her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) an invitation up to town.
<p/>It would be so much better,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) said, ``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.
<p/>I did not ask what she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) meant by <div class="bookquote">``all being over,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) referred to the expected decease of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mother and the gloomy sequel of funeral rites.
<p/>Eliza generally took no more notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) sister's indolence and complaints than if no such murmuring, lounging object had been before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>).
<p/>Georgiana should take her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) own course; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), Eliza, would take hers. '' '' '' One day, however, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) put away her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) account-book and unfolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) embroidery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) suddenly took her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) up
<p/>thus-- <div class="bookquote">``Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth. You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life.
<p/>Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.
<p/>Then, too, existence for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish, you die away.
<p/>Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?
<p/>Take one day; share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity.
<p/>The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do.
<p/>Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may.
<p/>Neglect it--go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.
<p/>I tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it.
<p/>After my mother's death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other.
<p/>You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new.
<p/>Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless creature in existence: and I know your spiteful hatred towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) closed her (<font color='blue'><b>creature</b></font>) lips. '' You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,'' answered Georgiana. '' Vere
<p/>: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.
<p/>'' Georgiana took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) handkerchief and blew her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) nose for an hour afterwards; Eliza sat cold, impassable, and assiduously industrious.
<p/>True, generous feeling is made small account of by some, but here were two natures rendered, the one intolerably acrid, the other despicably savourless for the want of it.
<p/>Feeling without judgment is a washy draught indeed; but judgment untempered by feeling is too bitter and husky a morsel for human deglutition.
<p/>It was a wet and windy afternoon: Georgiana had fallen asleep on the sofa over the perusal of a novel; Eliza was gone to attend a saint's-day service at the new church--for in matters of religion
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was a rigid formalist: no weather ever prevented the punctual discharge of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) devotional duties; fair or foul, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) went to church thrice every Sunday, and as often on week-days as there were prayers.
<p/>I bethought myself to go upstairs and see how the dying woman sped, who lay there almost unheeded: the very servants paid her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) but a remittent attention: the hired nurse, being little looked after, would slip out of the room whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could.
<p/>I found the sick-room unwatched, as I had expected: no nurse was there; the patient lay still, and seemingly lethargic; her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) livid face sunk in the pillows: the fire was dying in the grate.
<p/>I renewed the fuel, re-arranged the bedclothes, gazed awhile on her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) who could not now gaze on me, and then I moved away to the window.
<p/>Bessie was faithful; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) own family to mind, and could only come occasionally to the hall. The rain beat strongly against the panes, the wind blew tempestuously:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One lies there,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought, ``who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements. Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material tenement--flit when at length released?
<p/>In pondering the great mystery, I thought of Helen Burns, recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) dying words--her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) faith--her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) doctrine of the equality of disembodied souls.
<p/>I was still listening in thought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) well-remembered tones--still picturing her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) pale and spiritual aspect, her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) wasted face and sublime gaze, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) lay on her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) placid deathbed, and whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) longing to be restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Burns</b></font>) divine Father's bosom--when a feeble voice murmured from the couch behind: <div class="bookquote">``Who is that?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>'' I knew Mrs. Reed had not spoken for days: was she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) reviving? I went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>). '' It is I, Aunt Reed.''
<p/>'' Who--I? '' was her (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) answer. '' Who are you? '' looking at me with surprise and a sort of alarm, but still not wildly.
<p/>'' You are quite a stranger to me--where is Bessie?'' <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) is at the lodge, aunt.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Aunt,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Aunt</b></font>) repeated. '' Who calls me aunt?
<p/>You are not one of the Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to me:
<p/>you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre! '' I said nothing: I was afraid of occasioning some shock by declaring my identity.
<p/>I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight years she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) must be so changed.
<p/>I now gently assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) that I was the person she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) supposed and desired me to be: and seeing that I was understood, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) senses were quite collected, I explained how Bessie had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) husband to fetch me from Thornfield.
<p/>'' Yet,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' I am very ill, I know,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) said ere long.
<p/>'' I was trying to turn myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb. It is as well I should ease my mind before I die:
<p/>what we think little of in health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me. Is the nurse here?
<p/>or is there no one in the room but you? '' I assured her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) we were alone. '' Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.
<p/>One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child; the other--'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) stopped.
<p/>After all, it is of no great importance, perhaps,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) murmured to herself: <div class="bookquote">``and then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) is painful.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) made an effort to alter her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) position, but failed: her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) face changed; she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) seemed to experience some inward sensation--the precursor, perhaps, of the last pang.
<p/>Eternity is before me: I had better tell her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' '' Well, I must get it over. '' I obeyed her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) directions. '' Read the letter,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) said. It was short, and thus conceived:-- ``Madam,--Will
<p/>you have the goodness to send me the address of my niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) is?
<p/>Providence has blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried and childless, I wish to adopt her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) during my life, and bequeath her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) at my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c., <div class="bookquote">``JOHN EYRE, Madeira.
<p/>It is my intention to write shortly and desire her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) to come to me at Madeira. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It was dated three years back.
<p/>'' Why did I never hear of this? '' I asked. '' Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity.
<p/>I could not forget your conduct to me, Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty.
<p/>I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in a man's voice.--Bring me some water!
<p/>Dear Mrs. Reed,'' said I, as I offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) the draught she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) required, <div class="bookquote">``think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.
<p/>Oh, make haste!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' Forgive me for my passionate language : I was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) heeded nothing of what I said; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) had tasted the water and drawn breath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) went on thus--
<p/>I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what I could not endure.
<p/>I wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>); I said I was sorry for his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) had died of typhus fever at Lowood.
<p/>You were born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.
<p/>'' '' Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose my falsehood as soon as you like. '' ''
<p/>If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to regard me with kindness and forgiveness
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You have a very bad disposition,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and one to this day I feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, I can never comprehend.
<p/>Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not vindictive. '' I approached my cheek to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) lips: she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would not touch it.
<p/>As I laid her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) down--for I raised her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) and supported her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) on my arm while she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) drank--I covered her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ice-cold and clammy hand with mine: the feeble fingers shrank from my touch--the glazing eyes shunned my gaze.
<p/>Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,'' I said at last, <div class="bookquote">``you have my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said I oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) by leaning over the bed, and again demanded water. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Poor, suffering woman! it was too late for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to make now the effort to change her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) habitual frame of mind:
<p/>living, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had ever hated me--dying, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must hate me still. The nurse now entered, and Bessie followed. I yet lingered half-an-hour longer, hoping to see some sign of amity: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) gave none.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was fast relapsing into stupor; nor did her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) mind again rally: at twelve o'clock that night she (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) died. I was not present to close her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) eyes, nor were either of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) daughters.
<p/>They came to tell us the next morning that all was over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bessie</b></font>) was by that time laid out. Eliza and I went to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>):
<p/>There was stretched Sarah Reed's once robust and active frame, rigid and still: her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) eye of flint was covered with its cold lid; her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) brow and strong traits wore yet the impress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) inexorable soul.
<p/>Georgiana, who had burst out into loud weeping, said she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) dared not go. A strange and solemn object was that corpse to me.
<p/>I gazed on it with gloom and pain: nothing soft, nothing sweet, nothing pitying, or hopeful, or subduing did it inspire; only a grating anguish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) woes--not my loss--and a sombre tearless dismay at the fearfulness of death in such a form.
<p/>After a silence of some minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) observed-- <div class="bookquote">``With her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) constitution she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) should have lived to a good old age: her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) life was shortened by trouble.
<p/>And then a spasm constricted her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) mouth for an instant: as it passed away she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) turned and left the room, and so did I. Neither of us had dropt a tear.
<p/>Eliza surveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) parent calmly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXII Mr. Rochester had given me but one week's leave of absence: yet a month elapsed before I quitted Gateshead.
<p/>I wished to leave immediately after the funeral, but Georgiana entreated me to stay till she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could get off to London, whither
<p/>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was now at last invited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) uncle, Mr. Gibson, who had come down to direct his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sister's interment and settle the family affairs.
<p/>Georgiana said she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) dreaded being left alone with Eliza; from her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) got neither sympathy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) dejection, support in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) fears, nor aid in her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) preparations; so I bore with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) feeble-minded wailings and selfish lamentations as well as I could, and did my best in sewing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) and packing her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) dresses.
<p/>It is true, that while I worked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) would idle; and I thought to myself, <div class="bookquote">``If you and I were destined to live always together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.
<p/>I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone
<p/>It is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part.
<p/>: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>At last I saw Georgiana off; but now it was Eliza's turn to request me to stay another week.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) plans required all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) time and attention, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) was about to depart for some unknown bourne; and all day long she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) stayed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) door bolted within, filling trunks, emptying drawers, burning papers, and holding no communication with any one.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) wished me to look after the house, to see callers, and answer notes of condolence. One morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) told me I was at liberty.
<p/>There is some difference between living with such an one as you and with Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one.
<p/>'' And,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">``I am obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct! To-morrow,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``I set out for the Continent.
<p/>I shall take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested.
<p/>I shall devote myself for a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I neither expressed surprise at this resolution nor attempted to dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) from it. '' The vocation will fit you to a hair,'' I thought: <div class="bookquote">``much good may it do you!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I then returned: ``You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent.
<p/>When we parted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre ; I wish you well: you have some sense. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't much care.''
<p/>As I shall not have occasion to refer either to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) or her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) sister again, I may as well mention here, that Georgiana made an advantageous match with a wealthy worn-out man of fashion, and that Eliza actually took the veil, and is at this day superior of the convent where she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) passed the period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) novitiate, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) endowed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) fortune.
<p/>How people feel when they are returning home from an absence, long or short, I did not know: I had never experienced the sensation.
<p/>I had known what it was to come back to Gateshead when a child after a long walk, to be scolded for looking cold or gloomy; and later, what it was to come back from church to Lowood, to long for a plenteous meal and a good fire, and to be unable to get either.
<p/>Neither of these returnings was very pleasant or desirable: no magnet drew me to a given point, increasing in its strength of attraction the nearer I came.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are in the right,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); and with these words we each went our separate way. The return to Thornfield was yet to be tried.
<p/>During the first twelve hours I thought of Mrs. Reed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) last moments; I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) disfigured and discoloured face, and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) strangely altered voice.
<p/>I mused on the funeral day, the coffin, the hearse, the black train of tenants and servants--few was the number of relatives--the gaping vault, the silent church, the solemn service.
<p/>Then I thought of Eliza and Georgiana; I beheld one the cynosure of a ball-room, the other the inmate of a convent cell; and I dwelt on and analysed their separate peculiarities of person and character.
<p/>The evening arrival at the great town of--scattered these thoughts; night gave them quite another turn: laid down on my traveller's bed, I left reminiscence for anticipation.
<p/>My journey seemed tedious--very tedious: fifty miles one day, a night spent at an inn; fifty miles the next day. I was going back to Thornfield: but how long was I to stay there?
<p/>I had heard from Mrs. Fairfax in the interim of my absence: the party at the hall was dispersed; Mr. Rochester had left for London three weeks ago, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was then expected to return in a fortnight.
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax surmised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was gone to make arrangements for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) wedding, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had talked of purchasing a new carriage: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) said the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) marrying Miss Ingram still seemed strange to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>); but from what everybody said, and from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) had herself seen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) could no longer doubt that the event would shortly take place.
<p/>Not long; of that I was sure. '' You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,'' was my mental comment.
<p/>I dreamt of Miss Ingram all the night: in a vivid morning dream I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) closing the gates of Thornfield against me and pointing me out another road; and Mr. Rochester looked on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arms folded--smiling sardonically, as it seemed, at both her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) and me.
<p/>I had not notified to Mrs. Fairfax the exact day of my return; for I did not wish either car or carriage to meet me at Millcote.
<p/>I proposed to walk the distance quietly by myself; and very quietly, after leaving my box in the ostler's care, did I slip away from the George Inn, about six o'clock of a June evening, and take the old road to Thornfield: a road which lay chiefly through fields, and was now little frequented.
<p/>It was not a bright or splendid summer evening, though fair and soft: the haymakers were at work all along the road; and the sky, though far from cloudless, was such as promised well for the future: its blue--where blue was visible--was mild and settled, and its cloud strata high and thin.
<p/>no watery gleam chilled it--it seemed as if there was a fire lit, an altar burning behind its screen of marbled vapour, and out of apertures shone a golden redness.
<p/>I felt glad as the road shortened before me: so glad that I stopped once to ask myself what that joy meant: and to remind reason that it was not to my home I was going, or to a permanent resting-place, or to a place where fond friends looked out for me and waited my arrival.
<p/>'' I don't doubt it. '' The question followed, <div class="bookquote">``Where was I to go? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The west, too, was warm: ''
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,'' said I; ``and little Adele will clap her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you are thinking of another than they, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) is not thinking of you.
<p/>These affirmed that it was pleasure enough to have the privilege of again looking on Mr. Rochester, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) looked on me or not; and they added--<div class="bookquote">``Hasten!
<p/>be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) while you may: but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) for ever!
<p/>And then I strangled a new-born agony--a deformed thing which I could not persuade myself to own and rear--and ran on.
<p/>They are making hay, too, in Thornfield meadows: or rather, the labourers are just quitting their work, and returning home with their rakes on their shoulders, now, at the hour I arrive.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But what is so headstrong as youth? What so blind as inexperience? hasten! '' I have but a field or two to traverse, and then I shall cross the road and reach the gates.
<p/>How full the hedges are of roses! But I have no time to gather any; I want to be at the house.
<p/>I passed a tall briar, shooting leafy and flowery branches across the path; I see the narrow stile with stone steps; and I see--Mr.
<p/>Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is not a ghost; yet every nerve I have is unstrung: for a moment I am beyond my own mastery.
<p/>I did not think I should tremble in this way when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), or lose my voice or the power of motion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) presence.
<p/>Rochester sitting there, a book and a pencil in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is writing. What does it mean? I will go back as soon as I can stir: I need not make an absolute fool of myself.
<p/>I know another way to the house. It does not signify if I knew twenty ways; for he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) has seen me.
<p/>'' Hillo!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) cries; and he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) puts up his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) book and his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) pencil. '' There you are! Come on, if you please.
<p/>I suppose I do come on; though in what fashion I know not; being scarcely cognisant of my movements, and solicitous only to appear calm; and, above all, to control the working muscles of my face--which I feel rebel insolently against my will, and struggle to express what I had resolved to conceal.
<p/>'' But I have a veil--it is down: I may make shift yet to behave with decent composure. '' And this is Jane Eyre?
<p/>Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a dream or a shade.
<p/>Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot? What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) comes from the other world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) meets me alone here in the gloaming!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``A true Janian reply! Good angels be my guard! If I dared, I'd touch you, to see if you are substance or shadow,
<p/>you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take hold of a blue ignis fatuus light in a marsh. Truant! truant! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) added, when he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had paused an instant. '' Absent from me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!
<p/>I knew there would be pleasure in meeting my master again, even though broken by the fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was so soon to cease to be my master, and by the knowledge that I was nothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>): but there was ever in Mr. Rochester -LRB-so at least I thought-RRB- such a wealth of the power of communicating happiness, that to taste but of the crumbs he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) scattered to stray and stranger birds like me, was to feast genially.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) last words were balm: they seemed to imply that it imported something to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) whether I forgot him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) or not.
<p/>'' And he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had spoken of Thornfield as my home-- would that it were my home! He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did not leave the stile, and I hardly liked to ask to go by.
<p/>I inquired soon if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had not been to London. '' Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight. ''
<p/>'' Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.'' '' And did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) inform you what I went to do?'' '' Oh, yes, sir!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) won't look like Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.
<p/>Everybody knew your errand.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wish, Jane, I were a trifle better adapted to match with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) externally. Tell me now, fairy as you are--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be past the power of magic, sir;''  (<font color='red'><b>fairy</b></font>)</div>and, in thought, I added, <div class="bookquote">``A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.
<p/>can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome man?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>Mr. Rochester had sometimes read my unspoken thoughts with an acumen to me incomprehensible: in the present instance he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) took no notice of my abrupt vocal response; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) smiled at me with a certain smile he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) own, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) used but on rare occasions.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) seemed to think it too good for common purposes: it was the real sunshine of feeling--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) shed it over me now.
<p/>Pass, Janet,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), making room for me to cross the stile: <div class="bookquote">``go up home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' All I had now to do was to obey him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in silence: no need for me to colloquise further.
<p/>I got over the stile without a word, and meant to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) calmly. An impulse held me fast--a force turned me round.
<p/>I said--or something in me said for me, and in spite of me-- <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.
<p/>I am strangely glad to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I walked on so fast that even he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) could hardly have overtaken me had he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) tried.
<p/>Little Adele was half wild with delight when she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) saw me. Mrs. Fairfax received me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) usual plain friendliness. Leah smiled, and even Sophie bid me <div class="bookquote">``bon soir''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>with glee.
<p/>This was very pleasant; there is no happiness like that of being loved by your fellow-creatures, and feeling that your presence is an addition to their comfort.
<p/>I that evening shut my eyes resolutely against the future: I stopped my ears against the voice that kept warning me of near separation and coming grief.
<p/>When tea was over and Mrs. Fairfax had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) knitting, and I had assumed a low seat near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), and Adele, kneeling on the carpet, had nestled close up to me, and a sense of mutual affection seemed to surround us with a ring of golden peace, I uttered a silent prayer that we might not be parted far or soon; but when, as we thus sat, Mr. Rochester entered, unannounced, and looking at us, seemed to take pleasure in the spectacle of a group so amicable--when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) supposed the old lady was all right now that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had got her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) adopted daughter back again, and added that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) saw Adele was <div class="bookquote">``prete a croquer sa petite maman Anglaise'' (<font color='red'><b>Adele</b></font>)</div>--I half ventured to hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would, even after his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) marriage, keep us together somewhere under the shelter of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) protection, and not quite exiled from the sunshine of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) presence.
<p/>A fortnight of dubious calm succeeded my return to Thornfield Hall. Nothing was said of the master's marriage, and I saw no preparation going on for such an event.
<p/>Almost every day I asked Mrs. Fairfax if she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had yet heard anything decided: her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) answer was always in the negative.
<p/>Once she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had actually put the question to Mr. Rochester as to when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was going to bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) bride home; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had answered her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) only by a joke and one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) queer looks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) could not tell what to make of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>One thing specially surprised me, and that was, there were no journeyings backward and forward, no visits to Ingram Park: to be sure it was twenty miles off, on the borders of another county; but what was that distance to an ardent lover?
<p/>I began to cherish hopes I had no right to conceive: that the match was broken off; that rumour had been mistaken; that one or both parties had changed their minds.
<p/>I used to look at my master's face to see if it were sad or fierce; but I could not remember the time when it had been so uniformly clear of clouds or evil feelings.
<p/>If, in the moments I and my pupil spent with him (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>), I lacked spirits and sank into inevitable dejection, he (<font color='blue'><b>pupil</b></font>) became even gay.
<p/>To so practised and indefatigable a horseman as Mr. Rochester, it would be but a morning's ride. Never had he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) called me more frequently to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) presence; never been kinder to me when there--and, alas!
<p/>CHAPTER XXIII A splendid Midsummer shone over England: skies so pure, suns so radiant as were then seen in long succession, seldom favour even singly, our wave- girt land.
<p/>It was as if a band of Italian days had come from the South, like a flock of glorious passenger birds, and lighted to rest them on the cliffs of Albion.
<p/>The hay was all got in; the fields round Thornfield were green and shorn; the roads white and baked; the trees were in their dark prime; hedge and wood, full-leaved and deeply tinted, contrasted well with the sunny hue of the cleared meadows between.
<p/>On Midsummer-eve, Adele, weary with gathering wild strawberries in Hay Lane half the day, had gone to bed with the sun.
<p/>never had I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Hay</b></font>) so well. I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) drop asleep, and when I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>), I sought the garden.
<p/>It was now the sweetest hour of the twenty-four:--<div class="bookquote">``Day its fervid fires had wasted,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and dew fell cool on panting plain and scorched summit.
<p/>Where the sun had gone down in simple state--pure of the pomp of clouds--spread a solemn purple, burning with the light of red jewel and furnace flame at one point, on one hill-peak, and extending high and wide, soft and still softer, over half heaven.
<p/>The east had its own charm or fine deep blue, and its own modest gem, a casino and solitary star: soon it would boast the moon; but she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was yet beneath the horizon.
<p/>I walked a while on the pavement; but a subtle, well-known scent--that of a cigar--stole from some window; I saw the library casement open a handbreadth; I knew I might be watched thence; so I went apart into the orchard.
<p/>No nook in the grounds more sheltered and more Eden-like; it was full of trees, it bloomed with flowers: a very high wall shut it out from the court, on one side; on the other, a beech avenue screened it from the lawn.
<p/>At the bottom was a sunk fence; its sole separation from lonely fields: a winding walk, bordered with laurels and terminating in a giant horse-chestnut, circled at the base by a seat, led down to the fence.
<p/>While such honey-dew fell, such silence reigned, such gloaming gathered, I felt as if I could haunt such shade for ever; but in threading the flower and fruit parterres at the upper part of the enclosure, enticed there by the light the now rising moon cast on this more open quarter, my step is stayed--not by sound, not by sight, but once more by a warning fragrance.
<p/>Sweet-briar and southernwood, jasmine, pink, and rose have long been yielding their evening sacrifice of incense: this new scent is neither of shrub nor flower; it is--
<p/>Here one could wander unseen. I know it well--it is Mr. Rochester's cigar. I look round and I listen. I see trees laden with ripening fruit.
<p/>I hear a nightingale warbling in a wood half a mile off; no moving form is visible, no coming step audible; but that perfume increases: I must flee.
<p/>I step aside into the ivy recess; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) will not stay long: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) will soon return whence he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) came, and if I sit still he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) will never see me.
<p/>But no--eventide is as pleasant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) as to me, and this antique garden as attractive; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) strolls on, now lifting the gooseberry-tree branches to look at the fruit, large as plums, with which they are laden; now taking a ripe cherry from the wall; now stooping towards a knot of flowers, either to inhale their fragrance or to admire the dew-beads on their petals.
<p/>A great moth goes humming by me; it alights on a plant at Mr. Rochester's foot: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sees it, and bends to examine it.
<p/>Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) has his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) back towards me,'' thought I, <div class="bookquote">``and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is occupied too; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.
<p/>I trode on an edging of turf that the crackle of the pebbly gravel might not betray me: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was standing among the beds at a yard or two distant from where I had to pass; the moth apparently engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).
<p/>I make for the wicket leading to the shrubbery, and I see Mr. Rochester entering. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' I shall get by very well,'' I meditated.
<p/>As I crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) shadow, thrown long over the garden by the moon, not yet risen high, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said quietly, without turning-- <div class="bookquote">``Jane, come and look at this fellow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I had made no noise: he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had not eyes behind--could his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) shadow feel? I started at first, and then I approached him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).
<p/>Look at his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) wings,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), ``he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) reminds me rather of a West Indian insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England; there!
<p/>I was sheepishly retreating also; but Mr. Rochester followed me, and when we reached the wicket, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said-- <div class="bookquote">``Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise.
<p/>It is one of my faults, that though my tongue is sometimes prompt enough at an answer, there are times when it sadly fails me in framing an excuse; and always the lapse occurs at some crisis, when a facile word or plausible pretext is specially wanted to get me out of painful embarrassment.
<p/>I did not like to walk at this hour alone with Mr. Rochester in the shadowy orchard; but I could not find a reason to allege for leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>I followed with lagging step, and thoughts busily bent on discovering a means of extrication; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) himself looked so composed and so grave also,
<p/>I became ashamed of feeling any confusion: the evil--if evil existent or prospective there was--seemed to lie with me only; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) mind was unconscious and quiet.
<p/>Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) recommenced, as we entered the laurel walk, and slowly strayed down in the direction of the sunk fence and the horse-chestnut, <div class="bookquote">``Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of Adhesiveness?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is flown. '' The moth roamed away. '' '' '' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``I am attached to it, indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for simple dame Fairfax?''
<p/>'' Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.'' '' And would be sorry to part with them?''
<p/>It is always the way of events in this life,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) continued presently: ``no sooner have you got settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on, for the hour of repose is expired.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Pity! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) said, and sighed and paused. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Must I move on, sir? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked. '' Must I leave Thornfield?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you must, Jane. I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you must. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was a blow: but I did not let it prostrate me.
<p/>'' Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes. '' <div class="bookquote">``It is come now--I must give it to-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you are going to be married, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail straight on the head.''
<p/>``Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>)'s an extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche-RRB-:
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Soon, sir?''  (<font color='red'><b>Blanche</b></font>)</div>well, as I was saying--listen to me, Jane! You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you?
<p/>I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in case I married
<p/>I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I have made it my law of action.
<p/>That was only a lady-clock, child, `flying away home.' Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot forthwith. Adele must go to school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new situation.''
<p/>'' I was going to say, <div class="bookquote">``I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to betake myself to:''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but I stopped, feeling it would not do to risk a long sentence, for my voice was not quite under command.
<p/>In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,'' continued Mr. Rochester; <div class="bookquote">``and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose-- '' <div class="bookquote">``Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>I consider that when a dependent does her (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) duty as well as you have done yours, she (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) has a sort of claim upon her (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) employer for any little assistance he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) can conveniently render her (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>); indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.
<p/>Oh, no need to apologise! You'll like Ireland , I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say. '' <div class="bookquote">``It is a long way off, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``From what, Jane? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``From England and from Thornfield: and-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``From you , sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said this almost involuntarily, and, with as little sanction of free will, my tears gushed out.
<p/>The thought of Mrs. O'Gall and Bitternutt Lodge struck cold to my heart; and colder the thought of all the brine and foam, destined, as it seemed, to rush between me and the master at whose side I now walked, and coldest the remembrance of the wider ocean--wealth, caste, custom intervened between me and what I naturally and inevitably loved.
<p/>I did not cry so as to be heard, however; I avoided sobbing. '' It is a long way,'' I again said.
<p/>'' It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland, I shall never see you again,
<p/>Jane: that's morally certain. I never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the country. We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?''
<p/>And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the little time that remains to them close to each other.
<p/>we'll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.
<p/>'' Yes, sir.'' '' Come! Come, we will sit there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit there together.
<p/>It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be helped?
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seated me and himself. '' Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane? '' I could risk no sort of answer by this time: my heart was still.
<p/>Because,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.
<p/>And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>As for you,--you'd forget me.'' '' That I never should, sir: you know--'' Impossible to proceed. '' Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?
<p/>In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured no longer; I was obliged to yield, and I was shaken from head to foot with acute distress.
<p/>When I did speak, it was only to express an impetuous wish that I had never been born, or never come to Thornfield.
<p/>The vehemence of emotion, stirred by grief and love within me, was claiming mastery, and struggling for full sway, and asserting a right to predominate, to overcome, to live, rise, and reign at last: yes,--and to speak.
<p/>I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.
<p/>Listen! '' '' Because you are sorry to leave it? '' '' I have not been trampled on. I have not been petrified.
<p/>I have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high.
<p/>I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind.
<p/>I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever.
<p/>I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death. '' <div class="bookquote">``Where do you see the necessity?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) asked suddenly. '' Where? You, sir, have placed it before me.'' '' In what shape?'' <div class="bookquote">``In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>bride</b></font>)</div>'' My bride! What bride? I have no bride!'' '' But you will have.'' '' Yes;--I will!--I will!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) set his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) teeth.
<p/>'' Then I must go:--you have said it yourself.'' '' No: you must stay! I swear it--and the oath shall be kept.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I tell you I must go! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I retorted, roused to something like passion. '' Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?
<p/>Do you think I am an automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?
<p/>Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? You think wrong!--I have as much soul as you,--and full as much heart!
<p/>And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.
<p/>I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet,
<p/>equal,--as we are!'' '' As we are!'' repeated Mr. Rochester--<div class="bookquote">``so,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) added, enclosing me in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arms.

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>; for you are a married man--or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).
<p/>'' Yes, so, sir,'' I rejoined: <div class="bookquote">``and yet not so I would scorn such a union: therefore I am better than you--let me go!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Where, Jane? To Ireland?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Yes--to Ireland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>A waft of wind came sweeping down the laurel-walk, and trembled through the boughs of the chestnut: it wandered away--away--to an indefinite distance--it died.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The nightingale's song was then the only voice of the hour: in listening to it, I again wept.
<p/>Some time passed before he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) spoke; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) at last said-- <div class="bookquote">``Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Rochester sat quiet, looking at me gently and seriously. <div class="bookquote">``I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot return.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry. '' I was silent: I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) mocked me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come, Jane--come hither.''  (<font color='red'><b>bride</b></font>)</div>'' Your bride stands between us. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) rose, and with a stride reached me.

<p/>Jane, will you marry me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Still I did not answer, and still I writhed myself from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) grasp: for I was still incredulous.
<p/>'' Do you doubt me, Jane?'' <div class="bookquote">``Entirely.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' You have no faith in me?'' <div class="bookquote">``Not a whit.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Am I a liar in your eyes?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>liar</b></font>) asked passionately. '' Little sceptic, you shall be convinced. What love have I for Miss Ingram? None: and that you know.
<p/>: I caused a rumour to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) mother.
<p/>What love has she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) for me? None: as I have taken pains to prove I would not--I could not--marry Miss Ingram.
<p/>You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I love as my own flesh. You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are--I entreat to accept me as a husband.
<p/>'' I ejaculated, beginning in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) earnestness--and especially in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) incivility--to credit his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sincerity: <div class="bookquote">``me who have not a friend in the world

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Because I want to read your countenance--turn!'' '' There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched page.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) face was very much agitated and very much flushed, and there were strong workings in the features, and strange gleams in the eyes.
<p/>Read on: only make haste, for I suffer. '' '' Oh, Jane, you torture me! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) exclaimed. '' With that searching and yet faithful and generous look, you torture me!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``How can I do that? If you are true, and your offer real, my only feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Gratitude!

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Come to me--come to me entirely now,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); and added, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) deepest tone, speaking in my ear as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cheek was laid on mine, <div class="bookquote">``Make my happiness--I will make yours.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then, sir, I will marry you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Edward--my little wife!''

<p/>And if I had loved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) less I should have thought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) accent and look of exultation savage; but, sitting by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), roused from the nightmare of parting--called to the paradise of union--I thought only of the bliss given me to drink in so abundant a flow.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``No--that is the best of it,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said. Again and again he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Are you happy, Jane?

Have I not found her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friendless, and cold, and comfortless? Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)?
<p/>Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves? It will expiate at God's tribunal. I know my Maker sanctions what I do.
<p/>For the world's judgment--I wash my hands thereof. For man's opinion--I defy it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But what had befallen the night? The moon was not yet set, and we were all in shadow
<p/>: I could scarcely see my master's face, near as I was. And what ailed the chestnut tree? it writhed and groaned; while wind roared in the laurel walk, and came sweeping over us.
<p/>'' We must go in,'' said Mr. Rochester: <div class="bookquote">``the weather changes. I could have sat with thee till morning, Jane.''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>I should have said so, perhaps, but a livid, vivid spark leapt out of a cloud at which I was looking, and there was a crack, a crash, and a close rattling peal; and I thought only of hiding my dazzled eyes against Mr. Rochester's shoulder.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hurried me up the walk, through the grounds, and into the house; but we were quite wet before we could pass the threshold.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was taking off my shawl in the hall, and shaking the water out of my loosened hair, when Mrs. Fairfax emerged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) room.
<p/>And so,'' thought I, <div class="bookquote">``could I with you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>The rain rushed down. I did not observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) at first, nor did Mr. Rochester.
<p/>The lamp was lit. The clock was on the stroke of twelve. '' Hasten to take off your wet things,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``and before you go, good- night--good-night, my darling!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) kissed me repeatedly. When I looked up, on leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arms, there stood the widow, pale, grave, and amazed.
<p/>Explanation will do for another time,'' thought I. Still, when I reached my chamber, I felt a pang at the idea she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) should even temporarily misconstrue what she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) had seen.
<p/>But joy soon effaced every other feeling; and loud as the wind blew, near and deep as the thunder crashed, fierce and frequent as the lightning gleamed, cataract-like as the rain fell during a storm of two hours' duration, I experienced no fear and little awe.
<p/>Mr. Rochester came thrice to my door in the course of it, to ask if I was safe and tranquil: and that was comfort
<p/>Before I left my bed in the morning, little Adele came running in to tell me that the great horse-chestnut at the bottom of the orchard had been struck by lightning in the night, and half of it split away.
<p/>I only smiled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>), and ran upstairs. '' , that was strength for anything. CHAPTER XXIV As I rose and dressed, I thought over what had happened, and wondered if it were a dream.
<p/>I could not be certain of the reality till I had seen Mr. Rochester again, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) renew his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) words of love and promise.
<p/>While arranging my hair, I looked at my face in the glass, and felt it was no longer plain: there was hope in its aspect and life in its colour; and my eyes seemed as if they had beheld the fount of fruition, and borrowed beams from the lustrous ripple.
<p/>I had often been unwilling to look at my master, because I feared he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) could not be pleased at my look; but I was sure I might lift my face to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) now, and not cool his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) affection by its expression.
<p/>I took a plain but clean and light summer dress from my drawer and put it on: it seemed no attire had ever so well become me, because none had I ever worn in so blissful a mood.
<p/>I was not surprised, when I ran down into the hall, to see that a brilliant June morning had succeeded to the tempest of the night; and to feel, through the open glass door, the breathing of a fresh and fragrant breeze.
<p/>A beggar-woman and her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) little boy--pale, ragged objects both--were coming up the walk, and I ran down and gave them all the money I happened to have in my purse--some three or four shillings: good or bad, they must partake of my jubilee.
<p/>Nature must be gladsome when I was so happy. The rooks cawed, and blither birds sang; but nothing was so merry or so musical as my own rejoicing heart.
<p/>Mrs. Fairfax surprised me by looking out of the window with a sad countenance, and saying gravely--<div class="bookquote">``Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>During the meal she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) was quiet and cool: but I could not undeceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) then. I must wait for my master to give explanations; and so must she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>).
<p/>I ate what I could, and then I hastened upstairs. I met Adele leaving the schoolroom. '' Where are you going?
<p/>It is time for lessons.'' '' Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.'' <div class="bookquote">``Where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' In there,'' pointing to the apartment she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) had left; and I went in, and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) stood.
<p/>I gladly advanced; and it was not merely a cold word now, or even a shake of the hand that I received, but an embrace and a kiss.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Come and bid me good-morning,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). It seemed natural: it seemed genial to be so well loved, so caressed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>'' Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``truly pretty this morning. Is this my pale, little elf?
<p/>Is this my mustard- seed? This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-I had green eyes, reader; but you must excuse the mistake: for him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) they were new-dyed, I suppose.-RRB- '' It is Jane Eyre, sir.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Soon to be Jane Rochester,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) added: <div class="bookquote">``in four weeks, Janet; not a day more. Do you hear that? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I did, and I could not quite comprehend it: it made me giddy.
<p/>The feeling, the announcement sent through me, was something stronger than was consistent with joy--something that smote and stunned. It was, I think almost fear.
<p/>'' You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for? '' <div class="bookquote">``Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so strange.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, Mrs. Rochester,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``young Mrs. Rochester-- Fairfax Rochester's girl-bride.

<p/>This morning I wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) has in his (<font color='blue'><b>banker</b></font>) keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.
<p/>In a day or two I hope to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>).''
<p/>'' Oh, sir!--never rain jewels! I don't like to hear them spoken of. Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not have them.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings.''

<p/>I will attire my Jane in satin and lace, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shall have roses in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hair; and I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil.''
<p/>And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.
<p/>I would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir, though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.
<p/>You are dreaming, sir,--or you are sneering. For God's sake don't be ironical!'' '' '' Don't flatter me. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) theme, however, without noticing my deprecation.
<p/>'' This very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must choose some dresses for yourself.
<p/>The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.
<p/>After a brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record
<p/>: she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shall taste, too, of the life of cities; and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others.''

<p/>Seeing me, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) roused herself: she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) made a sort of effort to smile, and framed a few words of congratulation; but the smile expired, and the sentence was abandoned unfinished.

<p/>Sometimes I half fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never happened. Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)?

<p/>There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little uneasy at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) marked preference, and have wished to put you on your guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.
<p/>I knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself.
<p/>Last night I cannot tell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) then peeped round to where I sat; so stern a neighbour was too restrictive to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) present fractious mood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) dared whisper no observations, nor ask of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) any information.

<p/>We were now outside Thornfield gates, and bowling lightly along the smooth road to Millcote, where the dust was well laid by the thunderstorm, and, where the low hedges and lofty timber trees on each side glistened green and rain-refreshed.
<p/>'' '' <div class="bookquote">``Adele, look at that field. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Adele</b></font>)</div>'' In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight since--
<p/>the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two yards off me.
<p/>I looked at it. It was a little thing with a veil of gossamer on its head. I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my knee.
<p/>I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this effect--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver vale where we might live.
<p/>I said I should like to go; but reminded it, as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>`Oh,' returned the fairy, `that does not signify! Here is a talisman will remove all difficulties;' and she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) held out a pretty gold ring. '
<p/>Put it,' she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) said, `on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.'
<p/>The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring again.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) nodded again at the moon. '' But what has mademoiselle to do with it? I don't care for the fairy: you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?''
<p/>Whereupon I told her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) not to mind his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) badinage; and she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>), on her (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) part, evinced a fund of genuine French scepticism: denominating Mr. Rochester <div class="bookquote">``un vrai menteur,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>and assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) made no account whatever of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``contes de fee,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and that <div class="bookquote">``du reste
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Mademoiselle is a fairy,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said, whispering mysteriously. , il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand meme il y en
<p/>avait:'' she (<font color='blue'><b>fairy</b></font>) was sure they would never appear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), nor ever give him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) rings, or offer to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) in the moon.
<p/>The hour spent at Millcote was a somewhat harassing one to me. Mr. Rochester obliged me to go to a certain silk warehouse: there I was ordered to choose half-a-dozen dresses.
<p/>By dint of entreaties expressed in energetic whispers, I reduced the half-dozen to two: these however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) vowed he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would select himself.
<p/>With anxiety I watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eye rove over the gay stores: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) fixed on a rich silk of the most brilliant amethyst dye, and a superb pink satin.
<p/>I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) in a new series of whispers, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) might as well buy me a gold gown and a silver bonnet at once: I should certainly never venture to wear his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) choice.
<p/>With infinite difficulty, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was stubborn as a stone, I persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) to make an exchange in favour of a sober black satin and pearl-grey silk.
<p/>I hated the business, I begged leave to defer it: no--it should be gone through with now. '' It might pass for the present,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said;
<p/>Glad was I to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) out of the silk warehouse, and then out of a jewellers shop: the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) bought me, the more my cheek burned with a sense of annoyance and degradation.
<p/>As we re-entered the carriage, and I sat back feverish and fagged, I remembered what, in the hurry of events, dark and bright, I had wholly forgotten--the letter of my uncle, John Eyre, to Mrs. Reed: his (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) intention to adopt me and make me his (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) legatee.
<p/>It would, indeed, be a relief,'' I thought, <div class="bookquote">``if I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling daily round me.
<p/>I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) now.
<p/>And somewhat relieved by this idea -LRB-which I failed not to execute that day-RRB-, I ventured once more to meet my master's and lover's eye, which most pertinaciously sought mine, though I averted both face and gaze.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) smiled; and I thought his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) smile was such as a sultan might, in a blissful and fond moment, bestow on a slave his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) gold and gems had enriched: I crushed his (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) hand, which was ever hunting mine, vigorously, and thrust it back to him (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) red with the passionate pressure.
<p/>You need not look in that way,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; ``if you do, I'll wear nothing but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.
<p/>I'll be married in this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black satin.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) would yet see me glittering like a parterre.

<p/>'' Oh, it is rich to see and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>)? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>slave</b></font>) exclaimed. '' Is she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) original? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) piquant? I would not exchange this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio,

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) said this as he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) helped me to alight from the carriage, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) afterwards lifted out Adele, I entered the house, and made good my retreat upstairs.
<p/>I had prepared an occupation for him (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>); for I was determined not to spend the whole time in a tete-a-tete conversation.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) duly summoned me to his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) presence in the evening. I remembered his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) fine voice; I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) liked to sing--good singers generally do.
<p/>I was no vocalist myself, and, in his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) fastidious judgment, no musician, either; but I delighted in listening when the performance was good.
<p/>No sooner had twilight, that hour of romance, began to lower her (<font color='blue'><b>vocalist</b></font>) blue and starry banner over the lattice, than I rose, opened the piano, and entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>), for the love of heaven, to give me a song.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) said I was a capricious witch, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) would rather sing another time; but I averred that no time was like the present.
<p/>I was not fond of pampering that susceptible vanity of his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>); but for once, and from motives of expediency, I would e`en soothe and stimulate it.
<p/>'' Did I like his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) voice? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) asked. '' Very much. '' '' Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well, sir, I will try. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did try, but was presently swept off the stool and denominated ``a little bungler.
<p/>Being pushed unceremoniously to one side--which was precisely what I wished--he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) usurped my place, and proceeded to accompany himself: for he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) could play as well as sing.
<p/>And while I sat there and looked out on the still trees and dim lawn, to a sweet air was sung in mellow tones the following strain:-- <div class="bookquote">``The truest love that ever heart Felt at its kindled core, Did through each vein, in quickened start, The tide of being pour.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) coming was my hope each day, Her (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) parting was my pain; The chance that did her (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) steps delay Was ice in every vein.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hied me to the window-recess. I dreamed it would be nameless bliss, As I loved, loved to be; And to this object did I press As blind as eagerly.
<p/>But wide as pathless was the space That lay our lives between, And dangerous as the foamy race Of ocean-surges green.
<p/>And haunted as a robber-path Through wilderness or wood; For Might and Right, and Woe and Wrath, Between our spirits stood.
<p/>On sped my rainbow, fast as light; I flew as in a dream; For glorious rose upon my sight That child of Shower and Gleam.
<p/>I dangers dared; I hindrance scorned; I omens did defy: Whatever menaced, harassed, warned, I passed impetuous by. Still bright on clouds of suffering dim Shines that soft, solemn joy;
<p/>Nor care I now , how dense and grim Disasters gather nigh. I care not in this moment sweet, Though all I have rushed o'er Should come on pinion, strong and fleet, Proclaiming vengeance sore:
<p/>Though haughty Hate should strike me down, Right, bar approach to me, And grinding Might, with furious frown, Swear endless enmity.
<p/>My love has placed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) little hand With noble faith in mine, And vowed that wedlock's sacred band Our nature shall entwine.
<p/>My love has sworn, with sealing kiss, With me to live--to die; I have at last my nameless bliss. As I love--loved am I!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) rose and came towards me, and I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) face all kindled, and his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) full falcon-eye flashing, and tenderness and passion in every lineament.
<p/>a weapon of defence must be prepared--I whetted my tongue: as he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) reached me, I asked with asperity, <div class="bookquote">``whom he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) was going to marry now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I quailed momentarily--then I rallied. Soft scene, daring demonstration, I would not have; and I stood in peril of both: ''
<p/>That was a strange question to be put by his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) darling Jane.'' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed! I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) future wife dying with him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>).
<p/>What did he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) mean by such a pagan idea? I had no intention of dying with him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)--he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) might depend on that.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Oh, all he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) longed, all he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) prayed for, was that I might live with him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>)! Death was not for such as I.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Would I forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a reconciling kiss?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No: I would rather be excused.
<p/>Here I heard myself apostrophised as a <div class="bookquote">``hard little thing;''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and it was added, <div class="bookquote">``any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such stanzas crooned in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) praise.
<p/>I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) I was naturally hard--very flinty, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) would often find me so; and that, moreover, I was determined to show him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) divers rugged points in my character before the ensuing four weeks elapsed
<p/>: he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) should know fully what sort of a bargain he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had made, while there was yet time to rescind it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' Would I be quiet and talk rationally?'' <div class="bookquote">``I would be quiet if he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered myself
<p/>Very good,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought; ``you may fume and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I am certain.
<p/>I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual advantage.
<p/>From less to more, I worked him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up to considerable irritation; then, after he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had retired, in dudgeon, quite to the other end of the room, I got up, and saying, <div class="bookquote">``I wish you good-night, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in my natural and wonted respectful manner, I slipped out by the side-door and got away.
<p/>I was doing that now. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fretted, pished, and pshawed. '' '' The system thus entered on, I pursued during the whole season of probation; and with the best success.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was kept, to be sure, rather cross and crusty; but on the whole I could see he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was excellently entertained, and that a lamb-like submission and turtle-dove sensibility, while fostering his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) despotism more, would have pleased his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) judgment, satisfied his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) common-sense, and even suited his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) taste less.
<p/>In other people's presence I was, as formerly, deferential and quiet; any other line of conduct being uncalled for: it was only in the evening conferences I thus thwarted and afflicted him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) continued to send for me punctually the moment the clock struck seven; though when I appeared before him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had no such honeyed terms as <div class="bookquote">``love''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">``darling''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lips: the best words at my service were <div class="bookquote">``provoking puppet,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``malicious elf,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``sprite,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``changeling,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>&
<p/>c. For caresses, too, I now got grimaces; for a pressure of the hand, a pinch on the arm; for a kiss on the cheek, a severe tweak of the ear.
<p/>It was all right: at present I decidedly preferred these fierce favours to anything more tender. Mrs. Fairfax, I saw, approved me: her (<font color='blue'><b>elf</b></font>) anxiety on my account vanished; therefore I was certain
<p/>Meantime, Mr. Rochester affirmed I was wearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) to skin and bone, and threatened awful vengeance for my present conduct at some period fast coming.
<p/>I can keep you in reasonable check now,'' I reflected; <div class="bookquote">``and I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be devised.
<p/>I did well. I laughed in my sleeve at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) menaces. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Yet after all my task was not an easy one; often I would rather have pleased than teased him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>My future husband was becoming to me my whole world; and more than the world: almost my hope of heaven. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) stood between me and every thought of religion, as an eclipse intervenes between man and the broad sun.
<p/>I could not, in those days, see God for His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) creature: of whom I had made an idol. CHAPTER XXV The month of courtship had wasted: its very last hours were being numbered.
<p/>I , at least, had nothing more to do: there were my trunks, packed, locked, corded, ranged in a row along the wall of my little chamber; to-morrow, at this time, they would be far on their road to London: and so should I -LRB-D.V.-RRB-,--or rather, not I, but one Jane Rochester, a person
<p/>There was no putting off the day that advanced--the bridal day; and all preparations for its arrival were complete. whom as yet I knew not.
<p/>Mr. Rochester had himself written the direction, <div class="bookquote">``Mrs. Rochester, -- Hotel, London,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>on each: I could not persuade myself to affix them, or to have them affixed.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did not exist: she (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would not be born till to-morrow, some time after eight o'clock a.m.; and I would wait to be assured she (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had come into the world alive before I assigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) all that property.
<p/>It was enough that in yonder closet, opposite my dressing-table, garments said to be hers had already displaced my black stuff Lowood frock and straw bonnet: for not to me appertained that suit of wedding raiment; the pearl-coloured robe, the vapoury veil pendent from the usurped portmanteau.
<p/>I shut the closet to conceal the strange, wraith-like apparel it contained; which, at this evening hour--nine o'clock--gave out certainly a most ghostly shimmer through the shadow of my apartment.
<p/>The cards of address alone remained to nail on: they lay, four little squares, in the drawer. Mrs. Rochester! '' I will leave you by yourself, white dream,'' I said.
<p/>It was not only the hurry of preparation that made me feverish; not only the anticipation of the great change--the new life which was to commence to-morrow: both these circumstances had their share, doubtless, in producing that restless, excited mood which hurried me forth at this late hour into the darkening grounds: but a third cause influenced my mind more than they.
<p/>'' I am feverish: I hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it. '' I had at heart a strange and anxious thought.
<p/>Something had happened which I could not comprehend; no one knew of or had seen the event but myself: it had taken place the preceding night.
<p/>Mr. Rochester that night was absent from home; nor was he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) yet returned: business had called him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) to a small estate of two or three farms he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) possessed thirty miles off--business
<p/>I waited now his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) return; eager to disburthen my mind, and to seek of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) the solution of the enigma that perplexed me.
<p/>it was requisite he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) should settle in person, previous to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) meditated departure from England. Stay till he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) comes, reader; and, when I disclose my secret to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), you shall share the confidence.
<p/>I sought the orchard, driven to its shelter by the wind, which all day had blown strong and full from the south, without, however, bringing a speck of rain.
<p/>Instead of subsiding as night drew on, it seemed to augment its rush and deepen its roar: the trees blew steadfastly one way, never writhing round, and scarcely tossing back their boughs once in an hour; so continuous was the strain bending their branchy heads northward--the clouds drifted from pole to pole, fast following, mass on mass:
<p/>It was not without a certain wild pleasure I ran before the wind, delivering my trouble of mind to the measureless air-torrent thundering through space.
<p/>Descending the laurel walk, I faced the wreck of the chestnut-tree; it stood up black and riven: the trunk, split down the centre, gasped ghastly.
<p/>The cloven halves were not broken from each other, for the firm base and strong roots kept them unsundered below; though community of vitality was destroyed--the sap could flow no more: their great boughs on each side were dead, and next winter's tempests would be sure to fell one or both to earth: as yet, however, they might be said to form one tree--a ruin, but an entire ruin.
<p/>You did right to hold fast to each other,'' I said: as if the monster- splinters were living things, and could hear me.
<p/>I think, scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots: you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to sympathise with him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) decay.
<p/>As I looked up at them, the moon appeared momentarily in that part of the sky which filled their fissure; her (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) disk was blood-red and half overcast; she (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) seemed to throw on me one bewildered, dreary glance, and buried herself again instantly in the deep drift of cloud.
<p/>The wind fell, for a second, round Thornfield; but far away over wood and water, poured a wild, melancholy wail: it was sad to listen to, and I ran off again.
<p/>Here and there I strayed through the orchard, gathered up the apples with which the grass round the tree roots was thickly strewn; then I employed myself in dividing the ripe from the unripe; I carried them into the house and put them away in the store-room.
<p/>no glimpse of blue sky had been visible that July day. '' '' '' Then I repaired to the library to ascertain whether the fire was lit, for, though summer
<p/>, I knew on such a gloomy evening Mr. Rochester would like to see a cheerful hearth when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) came in: yes, the fire had been kindled some time, and burnt well.
<p/>I placed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arm-chair by the chimney-corner: I wheeled the table near it: I let down the curtain, and had the candles brought in ready for lighting.
<p/>More restless than ever, when I had completed these arrangements I could not sit still, nor even remain in the house: a little time-piece in the room and the old clock in the hall simultaneously struck ten.
<p/>I will run down to the gates: it is moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.
<p/>'' How late it grows! '' I said. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) may be coming now, and to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) will save some minutes of suspense.
<p/>The wind roared high in the great trees which embowered the gates; but the road as far as I could see, to the right hand and the left, was all still and solitary: save for the shadows of clouds crossing it at intervals as the moon looked out, it was but a long pale line, unvaried by one moving speck.
<p/>A puerile tear dimmed my eye while I looked--a tear of disappointment and impatience; ashamed of it, I wiped it away.
<p/>I lingered; the moon shut herself wholly within her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) chamber, and drew close her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) curtain of dense cloud: the night grew dark; rain came driving fast on the gale.
<p/>'' '' I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would come! I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would come! '' I exclaimed, seized with hypochondriac foreboding. I had expected his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) arrival before tea; now it was dark: what could keep him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)?
<p/>Had an accident happened? The event of last night again recurred to me. I interpreted it as a warning of disaster.
<p/>I feared my hopes were too bright to be realised; and I had enjoyed so much bliss lately that I imagined my fortune had passed its meridian, and must now decline.
<p/>Well, I cannot return to the house,'' I thought; <div class="bookquote">``I cannot sit by the fireside, while he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).
<p/>I set out; I walked fast, but not far: ere I had measured a quarter of a mile, I heard the tramp of hoofs; a horseman came on, full gallop; a dog ran by his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) saw me; for the moon had opened a blue field in the sky, and rode in it watery bright: he (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) hat off, and waved it round his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) head.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Away with evil presentiment! It was he (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>): here he (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) was, mounted on Mesrour, followed by Pilot. I now ran to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>).
<p/>There!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) exclaimed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) stretched out his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) hand and bent from the saddle: <div class="bookquote">``You can't do without me, that is evident.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Step on my boot-toe; give me both hands: mount! '' I obeyed: joy made me agile: I sprang up before him (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>).
<p/>A hearty kissing I got for a welcome, and some boastful triumph, which I swallowed as well as I could. He (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) checked himself in his (<font color='blue'><b>horseman</b></font>) exultation to demand,
<p/><div class="bookquote">``But is there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an hour? Is there anything wrong?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>'' No, but I thought you would never come. I could not bear to wait in the house for you, especially with this rain and wind.''
<p/>Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and hand are burning hot.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Rain and wind, indeed! I ask again, is there anything the matter?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.''
<p/>``Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay you will only laugh at me for my pains.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Then you have been both?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not: my prize is not certain.
<p/>This is you, who have been as slippery as an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose? I could not lay a finger anywhere
<p/>but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a stray lamb in my arms. You wandered out of the fold to seek your shepherd, did you, Jane?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I wanted you: but don't boast. Here we are at Thornfield: now let me get down. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>shepherd</b></font>) landed me on the pavement.
<p/>As John took his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) horse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) followed me into the hall, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) told me to make haste and put something dry on, and then return to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in the library; and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stopped me, as I made for the staircase, to extort a promise that I would not be long: nor was I long; in five minutes I rejoined him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.
<p/>I found him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) at supper. '' '' I sat down near him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), but told him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) I could not eat. '' Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?
<p/>Is it the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?'' <div class="bookquote">``I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what thoughts I have in my head.

(<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), placing it close to my eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had a rounded, muscular, and vigorous hand, as well as a long, strong arm.
<p/>'' Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream,'' said I, as I put it down from before my face.
<p/>'' Sir, have you finished supper?'' '' Yes, Jane. '' I rang the bell and ordered away the tray. When we were again alone, I stirred the fire, and then took a low seat at my master's knee.
<p/>'' It is near midnight,'' I said. '' Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before my wedding.

<p/>Give me your confidence, Jane,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``relieve your mind of any weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex and pain me. I want an explanation.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then, sir, listen.
<p/>I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in short, it has disturbed you.
<p/>You were from home last night?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Let me hear it. Mrs. Fairfax has said something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants
<p/>It struck twelve--I waited till the time-piece had concluded its silver chime, and the clock its hoarse, vibrating stroke, and then I proceeded.
<p/>All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting fears about the new sphere
<p/>, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, because I love you.
<p/>talk?--your sensitive self-respect has been wounded?'' '' No, sir. '' '' No, sir, don't caress me now--let me talk undisturbed. Yesterday I trusted well in Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good and mine
<p/>: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your journey.
<p/>I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your actual presence.
<p/>I thought of the life that lay before me-- your life, sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its own strait channel.
<p/>Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.
<p/>I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress.
<p/>I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose. I thought how I would carry down to you the square of unembroidered blond
<p/>I had myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could bring her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.
<p/>I saw plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.''
<p/>'' How well you read me, you witch!'' interposed Mr. Rochester: ``but what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me, because I am used to the sight of the demon.
<p/>But, sir, as it grew dark, the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and high--but `with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.
<p/>Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wished you were at home. I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me.
<p/>The gale still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some dog howling at a distance.
<p/>For some time after I went to bed, I could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me. I was glad when it ceased.
<p/>On sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night. I continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us.
<p/>; total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.
<p/>I thought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every moment.''
<p/>During all my first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road '' And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to you?
<p/>Little nervous subject! Forget visionary woe, and think only of real happiness! You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that; and you cannot deny it.
<p/>I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, Edward, because I love you.'
<p/>Those words did not die inarticulate on your lips. Do you love me, Jane?--repeat it.'' <div class="bookquote">``I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I think because you said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is too much as if some spirit were near me.
<p/>'' Well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, after some minutes' silence, <div class="bookquote">``it is strange; but that sentence has penetrated my breast painfully. Why? Look wicked, Jane:
<p/>as you know well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be incensed than saddened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have finished my tale: but hear me to the end.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I thought, Jane, you had told me all. I thought I had found the source of your melancholy in a dream.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shook my head. '' What! is there more? But I will not believe it to be anything important. I warn you of incredulity beforehand.
<p/>Go on. '' The disquietude of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) air, the somewhat apprehensive impatience of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) manner, surprised me: but I proceeded. ''
<p/>I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the retreat of bats and owls. I thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking.
<p/>I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass- grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice.
<p/>Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere, however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress, I must retain it.
<p/>I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a distant country.
<p/>I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit.
<p/>I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not stand.
<p/>I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and woke.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Now, Jane, that is all.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come. On waking, a gleam dazzled my eyes; I thought--
<p/>There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there.
<p/>Oh, it is daylight! But I was mistaken; it was only candlelight. Sophie, I supposed, had come in. I asked, `Sophie, what are you doing?'
<p/>a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau. '
<p/>I had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins.
<p/>No one answered; but Sophie! Sophie!' I again cried: and still it was silent. Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax:
<p/>it was not--no , I was sure of it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>The shape standing before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It must have been one of them,''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>interrupted my master. '' No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary. <div class="bookquote">``Describe it, Jane.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I know not what dress she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had on: it was white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.''
<p/>``It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) back. <div class="bookquote">``Did you see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face?
<p/>But presently she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) took my veil from its place; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) held it up, gazed at it long, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) threw it over her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own head, and turned to the mirror.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at first. At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And how were they?'' <div class="bookquote">``Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it! It was a discoloured face--it was a savage face.

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>``It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.
<p/>Just at my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thrust up her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah!--what did it do?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I was aware her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible from terror.
<p/>I rose, bathed my head and face in water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill, and determined that to none
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Who was with you when you revived?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No one, sir, but the broad day. but you would I impart this vision.
<p/>Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?'' '' The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain. I must be careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough handling.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the transaction actually took place.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And your previous dreams, were they real too?
<p/>Is Thornfield Hall a ruin? Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles? Am I leaving you without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?''
<p/>Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no recurrence of these mental terrors
<p/>I wish I could believe them to be only such: I wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the mystery of that awful visitant.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Not yet. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Am I about to do it? : I guarantee that. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Mental terrors, sir! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.''
<p/>But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top to bottom in two halves!
<p/>'' '' I felt Mr. Rochester start and shudder; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hastily flung his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arms round me. <div class="bookquote">``Thank God!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``that if anything malignant did come near you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.
<p/>Oh, to think what might have happened! ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) breath short, and strained me so close to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), I could scarcely pant.
<p/>After some minutes' silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) continued, cheerily-- <div class="bookquote">``Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it. It was half dream, half reality.
<p/>You call her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) a strange being yourself: from all you know, you have reason so to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>)--what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) do to me?
<p/>In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) entrance and her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you ascribed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) a goblin appearance different from her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) own: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is like her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>).
<p/>I see you would ask why I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I will tell you; but not now.
<p/>A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman was--must have been--Grace Poole. what to Mason? Are you satisfied, Jane?
<p/>I reflected, and in truth it appeared to me the only possible one: satisfied I was not, but to please him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) I endeavoured to appear so--relieved, I certainly did feel; so I answered him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) with a contented smile.
<p/>Do you accept my solution of the mystery? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And now, as it was long past one, I prepared to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>).
<p/>'' Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) asked, as I lit my candle. '' Yes, sir.''
<p/>Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep alone: promise me to go to the nursery.''
<p/>'' And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you. You must share it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) to-night, <div class="bookquote">``I shall be very glad to do so, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Sophie</b></font>)</div><p/>Wake Sophie when you go upstairs, under pretence of requesting her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) to rouse you in good time to- morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight.
<p/>'' And fasten the door securely on the inside. And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet. Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen?
<p/>and there is no more beating of rain against the window-panes: look here '' -LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) lifted up the curtain-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``it is a lovely night!
<p/>Half heaven was pure and stainless: the clouds, now trooping before the wind, which had shifted to the west, were filing off eastward in long, silvered columns.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was. The moon shone peacefully. '' Well,'' said Mr. Rochester, gazing inquiringly into my eyes, <div class="bookquote">``how is my Janet now?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The night is serene, sir; and so am I. '' '' And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy love and blissful union.
<p/>This prediction was but half fulfilled: I did not indeed dream of sorrow, but as little did I dream of joy; for I never slept at all.
<p/>With little Adele in my arms, I watched the slumber of childhood--so tranquil, so passionless, so innocent--and waited for the coming day
<p/>: all my life was awake and astir in my frame: and as soon as the sun rose I rose too.
<p/>: I remember I kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) as I loosened her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) little hands from my neck; and I cried over her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) with strange emotion, and quitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) because I feared my sobs would break her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) still sound repose.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) seemed the emblem of my past life; and here I was now to array myself to meet, the dread, but adored, type of my unknown future day.
<p/>CHAPTER XXVI Sophie came at seven to dress me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) was very long indeed in accomplishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) task; so long that Mr. Rochester, grown, I suppose, impatient of my delay, sent up to ask why I did not come.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) was just fastening my veil -LRB-the plain square of blond after all-RRB- to my hair with a brooch; I hurried from under her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophie</b></font>) hands as soon as I could.
<p/>'' I remember Adele clung to me as I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``Stop!''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) cried in French. '' Look at yourself in the mirror: you have not taken one peep.
<p/>So I turned at the door: I saw a robed and veiled figure, so unlike my usual self that it seemed almost the image of a stranger.
<p/>'' '' Jane! '' called a voice, and I hastened down. I was received at the foot of the stairs by Mr. Rochester.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) took me into the dining-room, surveyed me keenly all over, pronounced me <div class="bookquote">``fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) life, but the desire of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eyes,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and then telling me he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would give me but ten minutes to eat some breakfast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) rang the bell.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Lingerer!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry so long!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>One of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) lately hired servants, a footman, answered it.
<p/>'' Is John getting the carriage ready?'' '' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Is the luggage brought down?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' They are bringing it down, sir.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood -LRB-the clergyman-RRB- and the clerk are there: return and tell me. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>the reader</b></font>)</div><p/>The church, as the reader knows, was but just beyond the gates; the footman soon returned. '' Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) surplice.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the coachman in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) seat.''
 (<font color='red'><b>no groomsmen bridesmaids relatives</b></font>)</div><p/>There were no groomsmen, no bridesmaids, no relatives to wait for or marshal: none but Mr. Rochester and I. Mrs. Fairfax stood in the hall as we passed.
<p/>'' And the carriage?'' '' The horses are harnessing. '' '' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Jane, are you ready? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I rose. I would fain have spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), but my hand was held by a grasp of iron:
<p/>I was hurried along by a stride I could hardly follow; and to look at Mr. Rochester's face was to feel that not a second of delay would be tolerated for any purpose.
<p/>I wonder what other bridegroom ever looked as he (<font color='blue'><b>bridegroom</b></font>) did--so bent up to a purpose, so grimly resolute: or who, under such steadfast brows, ever revealed such flaming and flashing eyes.
<p/>I know not whether the day was fair or foul; in descending the drive, I gazed neither on sky nor earth: my heart was with my eyes; and both seemed migrated into Mr. Rochester's frame.
<p/>I wanted to see the invisible thing on which, as we went along, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) appeared to fasten a glance fierce and fell.
<p/>I wanted to feel the thoughts whose force he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) seemed breasting and resisting. At the churchyard wicket he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) stopped: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) discovered I was quite out of breath.
<p/>And now I can recall the picture of the grey old house of God rising calm before me, of a rook wheeling round the steeple, of a ruddy morning sky beyond.
<p/>I remember something, too, of the green grave-mounds; and I have not forgotten, either, two figures of strangers straying amongst the low hillocks and reading the mementoes graven on the few mossy head-stones.
<p/>I noticed them, because, as they saw us, they passed round to the back of the church; and I doubted not they were going to enter by the side-aisle door and witness the ceremony.
<p/>By Mr. Rochester they were not observed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was earnestly looking at my face from which the blood had, I daresay, momentarily fled: for I felt my forehead dewy, and my cheeks and lips cold.
<p/>'' Am I cruel in my love? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said. '' Delay an instant: lean on me, Jane. '' When I rallied, which I soon did, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) walked gently with me up the path to the porch.
<p/>We entered the quiet and humble temple; the priest waited in his (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>) white surplice at the lowly altar, the clerk beside him (<font color='blue'><b>priest</b></font>).
<p/>My conjecture had been correct: the strangers had slipped in before us, and they now stood by the vault of the Rochesters, their backs towards us, viewing through the rails the old time-stained marble tomb, where a kneeling angel guarded the remains of Damer de Rochester, slain at Marston Moor in the time of the civil wars, and of Elizabeth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Moor</b></font>) wife.
<p/>Hearing a cautious step behind me, I glanced over my shoulder: one of the strangers--a gentleman, evidently--was advancing up the chancel.
<p/>All was still: two shadows only moved in a remote corner. Our place was taken at the communion rails. The service began.
<p/>The explanation of the intent of matrimony was gone through; and then the clergyman came a step further forward, and, bending slightly towards Mr. Rochester, went on.
<p/>I require and charge you both -LRB-as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed-RRB-, that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful.
<p/>'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) paused, as the custom is. When is the pause after that sentence ever broken by reply? Not, perhaps, once in a hundred years.
<p/>And the clergyman, who had not lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) book, and had held his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) breath but for a moment, was proceeding: his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) hand was already stretched towards Mr. Rochester, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) lips unclosed to ask, <div class="bookquote">``Wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife?'' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>--when a distinct and near voice said-- ``The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.
<p/>The clergyman looked up at the speaker and stood mute; the clerk did the same; Mr. Rochester moved slightly, as if an earthquake had rolled under his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) feet: taking a firmer footing, and not turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) head or eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``Proceed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Presently Mr. Wood said-- <div class="bookquote">``I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wood/Wood</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Profound silence fell when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) had uttered that word, with deep but low intonation. '' The ceremony is quite broken off,'' subjoined the voice behind us.
<p/>Mr. Rochester heard, but heeded not: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) stood stubborn and rigid, making no movement but to possess himself of my hand.
<p/>'' I am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this marriage exists. '' What a hot and strong grasp he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had!
<p/>and how like quarried marble was his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) pale, firm, massive front at this moment! How his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eye shone, still watchful, and yet wild beneath!
<p/>Mr. Wood seemed at a loss. '' What is the nature of the impediment? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) asked. '' Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Hardly,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was the answer. '' I have called it insuperable, and I speak advisedly. '' The speaker came forward and leaned on the rails.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) continued, uttering each word distinctly, calmly, steadily, but not loudly-- <div class="bookquote">``It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.
<p/>My nerves vibrated to those low-spoken words as they had never vibrated to thunder--my blood felt their subtle violence as it had never felt frost or fire; but I was collected, and in no danger of swooning.
<p/>Mr. Rochester has a wife now living. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I looked at Mr. Rochester: I made him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) look at me. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) whole face was colourless rock: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eye was both spark and flint.
<p/>Without speaking, without smiling, without seeming to recognise in me a human being, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) only twined my waist with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arm and riveted me to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) side.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) disavowed nothing: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would defy all things. '' Who are you? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) asked of the intruder.
<p/>'' My name is Briggs, a solicitor of -- Street, London.'' '' And you would thrust on me a wife?'' <div class="bookquote">``I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law recognises, if you do not.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Briggs/Briggs</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Briggs calmly took a paper from his (<font color='blue'><b>Briggs</b></font>) pocket, and read out in a sort of official, nasal voice:-- '''I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. -- -LRB-a date of fifteen years back-RRB-, Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the county of --, and of Ferndean Manor, in --shire, England, was married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) wife, a Creole, at -- church, Spanish Town, Jamaica.
<p/>The record of the marriage will be found in the register of that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Favour me with an account of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)--with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) name, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) parentage, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) place of abode.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Certainly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Richard</b></font>)</div>Signed, Richard Mason.' ''
<p/>That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living.''
<p/>'' '' She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was living three months ago,'' returned the lawyer. '' How do you know?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will scarcely controvert.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Produce him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>)--or go to hell.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``I will produce him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) first--he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) is on the spot. Mr. Mason, have the goodness to step forward.
<p/>Mr. Rochester, on hearing the name, set his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) teeth; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) experienced, too, a sort of strong convulsive quiver; near to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) as I was, I felt the spasmodic movement of fury or despair run through his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) frame.
<p/>The second stranger, who had hitherto lingered in the background, now drew near; a pale face looked over the solicitor's shoulder--yes, it was Mason himself.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) eye, as I have often said, was a black eye: it had now a tawny, nay, a bloody light in its gloom; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) face flushed--olive cheek and hueless forehead received a glow as from spreading, ascending heart-fire: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) stirred, lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) strong arm--he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) could have struck Mason, dashed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) on the church-floor, shocked by ruthless blow the breath from his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) body--but Mason shrank away, and cried faintly, <div class="bookquote">``Good God!''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mason/Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div><p/>Contempt fell cool on Mr. Rochester--his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) passion died as if a blight had shrivelled it up: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) only asked--<div class="bookquote">``What have you to say?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Rochester turned and glared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). '' An inaudible reply escaped Mason's white lips. '' The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.
<p/>I again demand, what have you to say?'' <div class="bookquote">``Sir--sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>interrupted the clergyman, <div class="bookquote">``do not forget you are in a sacred place.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>Then addressing Mason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) inquired gently, <div class="bookquote">``Are you aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Courage,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div>urged the lawyer,--<div class="bookquote">``speak out.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the lawyer</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is now living at Thornfield Hall,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mason/Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div>said Mason, in more articulate tones: <div class="bookquote">``I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there last April. I am her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) brother.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Mason/Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``At Thornfield Hall!''  (<font color='red'><b>the clergyman</b></font>)</div>ejaculated the clergyman. '' Impossible! I am an old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at Thornfield Hall.
<p/>'' I saw a grim smile contort Mr. Rochester's lips, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) muttered-- <div class="bookquote">``No, by God! I took care that none should hear of it--or of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) under that name.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mused--for ten minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) held counsel with himself: he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) formed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) resolve, and announced it-- ``Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel.
<p/>Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green -LRB-to the clerk-RRB-, leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.
<p/>Mr. Rochester continued, hardily and recklessly: <div class="bookquote">``Bigamy is an ugly word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.
<p/>I am little better than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless fire and deathless worm.
<p/>this lawyer and his (<font color='blue'><b>lawyer</b></font>) client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to whom I was married lives!
<p/>You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch and ward.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>The man obeyed. Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what Some have whispered to you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is my bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress.
<p/>I now inform you that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his (<font color='blue'><b>bastard</b></font>) quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear.
<p/>Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd almost as soon strike a woman as you. Bertha Mason is mad; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets before.
<p/>Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertha</b></font>) parent in both points. I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy man.
<p/>I went through rich scenes! Oh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it! But I owe you no further explanation.
<p/>Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole's patient, and my wife !
<p/>You shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.
<p/>This girl,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) continued, looking at me, <div class="bookquote">``knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!
<p/>Come all of you--follow!''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Still holding me fast, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wood</b></font>) left the church: the three gentlemen came after. At the front door of the hall we found the carriage.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Take it back to the coach-house, John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Rochester coolly; <div class="bookquote">``it will not be wanted to-day. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>At our entrance, Mrs. Fairfax, Adele, Sophie, Leah, advanced to meet and greet us.
<p/>'' To the right-about--every soul!'' cried the master; <div class="bookquote">``away with your congratulations! Who wants them? Not I!--they are fifteen years too late!''
 (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) passed on and ascended the stairs, still holding my hand, and still beckoning the gentlemen to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), which they did.
<p/>We mounted the first staircase, passed up the gallery, proceeded to the third storey: the low, black door, opened by Mr. Rochester's master-key, admitted us to the tapestried room, with its great bed and its pictorial cabinet.
<p/>'' You know this place, Mason,'' said our guide; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>gentlemen</b></font>) bit and stabbed you here. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mason/Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) lifted the hangings from the wall, uncovering the second door: this, too, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) opened.
<p/>In a room without a window, there burnt a fire guarded by a high and strong fender, and a lamp suspended from the ceiling by a chain.
<p/>Grace Poole bent over the fire, apparently cooking something in a saucepan. In the deep shade, at the farther end of the room, a figure ran backwards and forwards.
<p/>What it was, whether beast or human being, one could not, at first sight, tell: it grovelled, seemingly, on all fours; it snatched and growled like some strange wild animal: but it was covered with clothing, and a quantity of dark, grizzled hair, wild as a mane, hid its head and face.
<p/>We're tolerable, sir, I thank you,'' replied Grace, lifting the boiling mess carefully on to the hob: <div class="bookquote">``rather snappish, but not `rageous.
<p/>A fierce cry seemed to give the lie to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) favourable report: the clothed hyena rose up, and stood tall on its hind-feet.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div>Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!'' said Mr. Rochester. '' How are you? and how is your charge to-day?'' '' '' '' Ah!
<p/>sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) sees you! '' exclaimed Grace: <div class="bookquote">``you'd better not stay. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Grace</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!''  (<font color='red'><b>The maniac</b></font>)</div>The maniac bellowed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) parted her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) shaggy locks from her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) visage, and gazed wildly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) visitors.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Keep out of the way,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Rochester, thrusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) aside: ``she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) has no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``One never knows what she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) has, sir: she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) is so cunning: it is not in mortal discretion to fathom her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) craft.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I recognised well that purple face,--those bloated features. Mrs. Poole advanced. '' <div class="bookquote">``We had better leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>),''  (<font color='red'><b>Mason/Mr. Mason</b></font>)</div>whispered Mason. <div class="bookquote">``Go to the devil!
<p/>Mr. Rochester flung me behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>): the lunatic sprang and grappled his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) throat viciously, and laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) teeth to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) cheek: they struggled.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) was a big woman, in stature almost equalling her (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) husband, and corpulent besides: she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) showed virile force in the contest--more than once she (<font color='blue'><b>Poole</b></font>) almost throttled him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), athletic as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>brother-in-law</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) brother-in-law's recommendation. '' `Ware!'' cried Grace. The three gentlemen retreated simultaneously. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ware</b></font>) could have settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) with a well-planted blow; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ware</b></font>) would not strike: he (<font color='blue'><b>Ware</b></font>) would only wrestle.
<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Ware</b></font>) mastered her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) arms; Grace Poole gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Ware</b></font>) a cord, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Ware</b></font>) pinioned them behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>): with more rope, which was at hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ware</b></font>) bound her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) to a chair.
<p/>The operation was performed amidst the fiercest yells and the most convulsive plunges. Mr. Rochester then turned to the spectators: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) looked at them with a smile both acrid and desolate.
<p/>Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure hours!
<p/>And this is what I wished to have'' -LRB-laying his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hand on my shoulder-RRB-: <div class="bookquote">``this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) just as a change after that fierce ragout.
<p/>Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That is my wife ,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). '' Wood and Briggs, look at the difference! Off with you now. I must shut up my prize.
<p/>'' We all withdrew. Mr. Rochester stayed a moment behind us, to give some further order to Grace Poole. The solicitor addressed me as he (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>) descended the stair.
<p/>You, madam,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>solicitor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be glad to hear it--if, indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should be still living--when Mr. Mason returns to Madeira.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' '' My uncle! What of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>)? Do you know him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>)?'' '' Mr. Mason does. Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) house for some years.
<p/>When your uncle received your letter intimating the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira to recruit his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) health, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) way back to Jamaica, happened to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Rochester.
<p/>Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will ever rise.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.
<p/>Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose, revealed the real state of matters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) referred him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) to me for assistance.
<p/>I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also. Were I not morally certain that your uncle will be dead
<p/>, I would advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.
<p/>No, no--let us be gone,'' was the anxious reply; and without waiting to take leave of Mr. Rochester, they made their exit at the hall door.
<p/>The clergyman stayed to exchange a few sentences, either of admonition or reproof, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) haughty parishioner; this duty done, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) too departed.
<p/>I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) go as I stood at the half-open door of my own room, to which I had now withdrawn.
<p/>The house cleared, I shut myself in, fastened the bolt that none might intrude, and proceeded--not to weep, not to mourn, I was yet too calm for that, but--mechanically to take off the wedding dress, and replace it by the stuff
<p/>ere you reach Madeira Have we anything else to stay for? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) inquired of Mr. Mason. '' gown I had worn yesterday, as I thought, for the last time.
<p/>I then sat down: I felt weak and tired. I leaned my arms on a table, and my head dropped on them.
<p/>And now I thought: till now I had only heard, seen, moved--followed up and down where I was led or dragged--watched event rush on event, disclosure open beyond disclosure: but now , I thought .
<p/>The morning had been a quiet morning enough--all except the brief scene with the lunatic: the transaction in the church had not been noisy; there was no explosion of passion, no loud altercation, no dispute, no defiance or challenge, no tears, no sobs: a few words had been spoken, a calmly pronounced objection to the marriage made; some stern, short questions put by Mr. Rochester; answers, explanations given, evidence adduced; an open admission of the truth had been uttered by my master; then the living proof had been seen; the intruders were gone, and all was over.
<p/>I was in my own room as usual--just myself, without obvious change: nothing had smitten me, or scathed me, or maimed me.
<p/>Jane Eyre, who had been an ardent, expectant woman--almost a bride, was a cold, solitary girl again: her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life was pale; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) prospects were desolate.
<p/>A Christmas frost had come at midsummer; a white December storm had whirled over June; ice glazed the ripe apples, drifts crushed the blowing roses; on hayfield and cornfield lay a frozen shroud: lanes which last night blushed full of flowers, to-day were pathless with untrodden snow; and the woods, which twelve hours since waved leafy and flagrant as groves between the tropics, now spread, waste, wild, and white as pine-forests in wintry Norway.
<p/>My hopes were all dead--struck with a subtle doom, such as, in one night, fell on all the first-born in the land of Egypt.
<p/>I looked on my cherished wishes, yesterday so blooming and glowing; they lay stark, chill, livid corpses that could never revive.
<p/>I looked at my love: that feeling which was my master's--which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had created; it shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle; sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) breast.
<p/>And yet where was the Jane Eyre of yesterday?--where was her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) life?--where were her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) prospects? Oh, never more could it turn to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); for faith was blighted--confidence destroyed!
<p/>I would not ascribe vice to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); I would not say he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had betrayed me; but the attribute of stainless truth was gone from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) idea, and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) presence I must go: that I perceived well.
<p/>Mr. Rochester was not to me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had been; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was not what I had thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). When--how--whither, I could not yet discern; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) himself, I doubted not, would hurry me from Thornfield.
<p/>Real affection, it seemed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) could not have for me; it had been only fitful passion: that was balked; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would want me no more.
<p/>I should fear even to cross his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) path now: my view must be hateful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>). Oh, how blind had been my eyes!
<p/>My eyes were covered and closed: eddying darkness seemed to swim round me, and reflection came in as black and confused a flow.
<p/>Self-abandoned, relaxed, and effortless, I seemed to have laid me down in the dried-up bed of a great river; I heard a flood loosened in remote mountains, and felt the torrent come: to rise
<p/>How weak my conduct! I had no will, to flee I had no strength. I lay faint, longing to be dead.
<p/>One idea only still throbbed life-like within me--a remembrance of God: it begot an unuttered prayer: these words went wandering up and down in my rayless mind, as something that should be whispered, but no energy was found to express them-- ``Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.
<p/>It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me.
<p/>The whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass.
<p/>That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, <div class="bookquote">``the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Some time in the afternoon I raised my head, and looking round and seeing the western sun gilding the sign of its decline on the wall, I asked, <div class="bookquote">``What am I to do?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' CHAPTER XXVII But the answer my mind gave--<div class="bookquote">``Leave Thornfield at once'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--was so prompt, so dread, that I stopped my ears.
<p/>That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my woe,'' I alleged: <div class="bookquote">``that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but that I must leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.
<p/>I said I could not bear such words now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot do it. '' But, then, a voice within me averred that I could do it and foretold that I should do it.
<p/>I wrestled with my own resolution: I wanted to be weak that I might avoid the awful passage of further suffering I saw laid out for me; and Conscience, turned tyrant, held Passion by the throat, told her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) tauntingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had yet but dipped her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dainty foot in the slough, and swore that with that arm of iron he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) would thrust her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) down to unsounded depths of agony.
<p/>No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.
<p/>'' Let me be torn away,'' then I cried. <div class="bookquote">``Let another help me!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' I rose up suddenly, terror-struck at the solitude which so ruthless a judge haunted,--at
<p/>I perceived that I was sickening from excitement and inanition; neither meat nor drink had passed my lips that day, for I had taken no breakfast.
<p/>And, with a strange pang, I now reflected that, long as I had been shut up here, no message had been sent to ask how I was, or to invite me to come down: not even little Adele had tapped at the door; not even Mrs. Fairfax had sought me.
<p/>the silence which so awful a voice filled. My head swam as I stood erect. '' Friends always forget those whom fortune forsakes,'' I murmured, as I undrew the bolt and passed out.
<p/>I stumbled over an obstacle: my head was still dizzy, my sight was dim, and my limbs were feeble. I could not soon recover myself.
<p/>I fell, but not on to the ground: an outstretched arm caught me. I looked up-- I was supported by Mr. Rochester, who sat in a chair across my chamber threshold.
<p/>Well, I have been waiting for you long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock like a burglar.
<p/>'' You come out at last,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>burglar</b></font>) said. '' So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone! I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.
<p/>I was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.
<p/>You are passionate. I expected a scene of some kind. But I err: you have not wept at all! I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears.
<p/>I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?'' '' Well, Jane! not a word of reproach? Nothing bitter--nothing poignant? Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?
<p/>You sit quietly where I have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.'' '' Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.
<p/>If the man who had but one little ewe lamb that was dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as a daughter, that ate of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bread and drank of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cup, and lay in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bosom, had by some mistake slaughtered it at the shambles, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not have rued his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bloody blunder more than I now rue mine.
<p/>There was such deep remorse in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, such true pity in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) tone, such manly energy in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner; and besides, there was such unchanged love in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) whole look and mien--
<p/>Will you ever forgive me? '' Reader, I forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) at the moment and on the spot. I forgave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) all: yet not in words, not outwardly; only at my heart's core.
<p/>'' ere long he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inquired wistfully--wondering, I suppose, at my continued silence and tameness, the result rather of weakness than of will.
<p/>'' You know I am a scoundrel, Jane? '' Yes, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>I cannot: I am tired and sick. I want some water. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) heaved a sort of shuddering sigh, and taking me in his (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) arms, carried me downstairs.
<p/>At first I did not know to what room he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) had borne me; all was cloudy to my glazed sight: presently I felt the reviving warmth of a fire; for, summer as it was, I had become icy cold in my chamber.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) put wine to my lips; I tasted it and revived; then I ate something he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) offered me, and was soon myself.
<p/>If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be well for me,'' I thought; <div class="bookquote">``then I should not have to make the effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.
<p/>I was in the library--sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) chair--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was quite near. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I must leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), it appears. I do not want to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)--I cannot leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How are you now, Jane? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Much better, sir; I shall be well soon. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Taste the wine again, Jane.
<p/>Suddenly he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) turned away, with an inarticulate exclamation, full of passionate emotion of some kind; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) walked fast through the room and came back; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) stooped towards me as if to kiss me; but I remembered caresses were now forbidden.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); then he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) put the glass on the table, stood before me, and looked at me attentively. I turned my face away and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) aside.
<p/>'' What!--How is this? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) exclaimed hastily. '' Oh, I know! you won't kiss the husband of Bertha Mason? You consider my arms filled and my embraces appropriated?''
<p/>I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess rightly?''
<p/>If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid, and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div>``Why, Jane? <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What do you say to that?
<p/>I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene: you are thinking how to act -- talking you consider is of no use.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Sir, I do not wish to act against you,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; and my unsteady voice warned me to curtail my sentence.
<p/>I know you--I am on my guard.'' '' Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy me.
<p/>You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss me.
<p/>You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will say,--`That man had nearly made me his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mistress: I must be ice and rock to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>);' and ice and rock you will accordingly become.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``All is changed about me, sir; I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations, there is only one way--
<p/>Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion of such as we imagine.
<p/>Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I. I was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was haunted.
<p/>I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never would have a governess to stay if she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) knew with what inmate she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) safely enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement.
<p/>Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) charge: but to each villain his (<font color='blue'><b>villain</b></font>) own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect assassination, even of what I most hate.
<p/>Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.
<p/>But I'll shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with my wife , as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) company and be at hand to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) aid in the paroxysms, when my wife is prompted by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cleared and steadied my voice to reply: Adele must have a new governess, sir.'' '' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``Sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>keeper</b></font>), ``you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady: you speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) with hate--with vindictive antipathy.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Jane, my little darling -LRB-so I will call you, for so you are-RRB-, you don't know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is mad I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).
<p/>It is cruel--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cannot help being mad.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?'' <div class="bookquote">``I do indeed, sir.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about the sort of love of which I am capable.
<p/>Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.
<p/>Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.
<p/>I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>): in your quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of recognition for me.--But
<p/>'' why do I follow that train of ideas? I was talking of removing you from Thornfield. All, you know, is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.
<p/>I only ask you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever!
<p/>I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from falsehood and slander.''
<p/>'' And take Adele with you, sir,'' I interrupted; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) will be a companion for you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' What do you mean, Jane?
<p/>I told you I would send Adele to school; and what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a French dancer's bastard?
<p/>Why do you importune me about her (<font color='blue'><b>dancer</b></font>)! I say, why do you assign Adele to me for a companion?'' <div class="bookquote">``You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull: too dull for you.''

I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming in your countenance.
<p/>I shook my head: it required a degree of courage, excited as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was becoming, even to risk that mute sign of dissent.
<p/>You are to share my solitude. Do you understand? '' He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had been walking fast about the room, and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) stopped, as if suddenly rooted to one spot.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) looked at me long and hard: I turned my eyes from him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), fixed them on the fire, and tried to assume and maintain a quiet, collected aspect.
<p/>Now for the hitch in Jane's character,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said at last, speaking more calmly than from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) look I had expected him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to speak.
<p/>The reel of silk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot and a puzzle: here it is.
<p/>'' '' Now for vexation, and exasperation, and endless trouble! By God! I long to exert a fraction of Samson's strength, and break the entanglement like tow!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) recommenced his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) walk, but soon again stopped, and this time just before me. '' Jane! will you hear reason? ''
<p/>-LRB-he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) stooped and approached his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) lips to my ear-RRB-; <div class="bookquote">``because, if you won't, I'll try violence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) voice was hoarse
<p/>; his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) look that of a man who is just about to burst an insufferable bond and plunge headlong into wild license.
<p/>I saw that in another moment, and with one impetus of frenzy more, I should be able to do nothing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>).
<p/>The present--the passing second of time--was all I had in which to control and restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>)--a movement of repulsion, flight, fear would have sealed my doom,--and his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>).
<p/>But I was not afraid: not in the least. I felt an inward power; a sense of influence, which supported me.
<p/>The crisis was perilous; but not without its charm: such as the Indian, perhaps, feels when he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) slips over the rapid in his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) canoe.
<p/>I took hold of his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) clenched hand, loosened the contorted fingers, and said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>), soothingly-- <div class="bookquote">``Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.
<p/>I had been struggling with tears for some time: I had taken great pains to repress them, because I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) would not like to see me weep.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) sat down: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) did not get leave to speak directly. Now, however, I considered it well to let them flow as freely and as long as they liked.
<p/>If the flood annoyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>), so much the better. So I gave way and cried heartily. Soon I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) earnestly entreating me to be composed.
<p/>But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not endure it.
<p/>I said I could not while he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) was in such a passion. '' Hush, now, and wipe your eyes. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) softened voice announced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) was subdued; so I, in my turn, became calm.
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) made an effort to rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) head on my shoulder, but I would not permit it. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) would draw me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>): no.
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>Indian</b></font>) said, in such an accent of bitter sadness it thrilled along every nerve I had; <div class="bookquote">``you don't love me, then?

<p/>I ought probably to have done or said nothing; but I was so tortured by a sense of remorse at thus hurting his (<font color='blue'><b>ape</b></font>) feelings, I could not control the wish to drop balm where I had wounded.
<p/>I do love you,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``more than ever: but I must not show or indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.''

<p/>I say? '' '' The last time, Jane! What! '' No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but
<p/>one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.'' '' Oh, mention it! If I storm, you have the art of weeping.
<p/>'' '' Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.'' '' For how long, Jane? For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?''

<p/>You shall go to a place I have in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the Mediterranean.
<p/>I shall keep only to you so long as you and I live. There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most innocent life.

<p/>Out of pity to me and yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>To agitate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thus deeply, by a resistance he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so abhorred, was cruel: to yield was out of the question.

<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div>burst involuntarily from my lips. '' I am a fool!'' cried Mr. Rochester suddenly. '' I keep telling her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) I am not married, and do not explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) why.
<p/>I forget she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows nothing of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my infernal union with her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Just put your hand in mine, Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the case.
<p/>Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in opinion, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knows all that I know! Can you listen to me?''
<p/>Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?''
<p/>'' Yes, sir; for hours if you will. '' ``I ask only minutes. <div class="bookquote">``I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.''
 (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have understood something to that effect.
<p/>Well, Jane, being so, it was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolution to keep the property together; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not bear the idea of dividing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) estate and leaving me a fair portion: all, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Yet as little could he (<font color='blue'><b>Rowland</b></font>) endure that a son of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rowland</b></font>) should be a poor man. I must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rowland</b></font>) sought me a partner betimes. Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) old acquaintance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was certain his (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) possessions were real and vast: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) made inquiries.
<p/>Mr. Mason, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) found, had a son and daughter; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) learned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed.
<p/>My father said nothing about her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) money; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish Town for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) beauty: and this was no lie.
<p/>When I left college, I was sent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me. I found her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) a fine woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>). They showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) to me in parties, splendidly dressed.
<p/>I seldom saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) alone, and had very little private conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) charms and accomplishments.
<p/>All the men in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) circle seemed to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) and envy me. I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>).
<p/>There is no folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.
<p/>Oh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of inward contempt masters me. I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not even know her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>).
<p/>I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor refinement in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>) mind or manners--and, I married her (<font color='blue'><b>Ingram</b></font>):--gross, grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!
<p/>With less sin I might have-- But let me remember to whom I am speaking.'' '' My bride's mother I had never seen:
<p/>I understood she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was dead. The honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum.
<p/>The elder one, whom you have seen -LRB-and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor all his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) kindred, because he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) has some grains of affection in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) takes in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) once bore me-RRB-, will probably be in the same state one day.
<p/>My father and my brother Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the plot against me.''
<p/>These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife, even when I found her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nature wholly alien to mine, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) tastes obnoxious to me, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) violent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) absurd, contradictory, exacting orders--even then I restrained myself:
<p/>I eschewed upbraiding, I curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.
<p/>There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot. '' '' Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words shall express what I have to say.
<p/>I lived with that woman upstairs four years, and before that time she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had tried me indeed: her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) vices sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would not use cruelty.
<p/>Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.
<p/>What a pigmy intellect she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had, and what giant propensities! How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on me! ''
<p/>My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my father died too. I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved
<p/>And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered that my wife was mad--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity.
<p/>I ever saw, was associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me. Jane, you don't like my narrative
<p/>; you look almost sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?'' <div class="bookquote">``No, sir, finish it now; I pity you-- I do earnestly pity you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant contempt for those who have endured them.
<p/>But that is not your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.
<p/>Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion.
<p/>I accept it, Jane; let the daughter have free advent--my arms wait to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was mad?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was all that intervened between me and the gulf.
<p/>In the eyes of the world, I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mental defects.
<p/>Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) daily: something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) breath -LRB-faugh!-RRB-
<p/>mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) husband--that recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me
<p/>; moreover, I knew that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) lived I could never be the husband of another and better wife; and, though five years my senior -LRB-her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) family and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) father had lied to me even in the particular of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) age-RRB-, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was infirm in mind.
<p/>One night I had been awakened by her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) yells---LRB-since the medical men had pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mad, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had, of course, been shut up-RRB---it was a fiery West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the hurricanes of those climates.
<p/>Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless. '' Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and opened the window.
<p/>Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) threw her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest.
<p/>I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>): though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wolfish cries.
<p/>The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no refreshment anywhere. '' `This life,' said I at last, `is hell: this is the air--those are the sounds of the bottomless pit!
<p/>I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can. The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.
<p/>Of the fanatic's burning eternity I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present one--let me break away, and go home to God!'
<p/>'' I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.
<p/>I only entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.
<p/>A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure.
<p/>While I walked under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to follow.
<p/>The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living blood--my being longed for renewal--
<p/>'' I then framed and fixed a resolution. '' my soul thirsted for a pure draught. I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.
<p/>From a flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:-- ''`Go,' said Hope, `and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.
<p/>You may take the maniac with you to England; confine her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) with due attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will, and form what new tie you like.
<p/>That woman, who has so abused your long- suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband.
<p/>See that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is cared for as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) condition demands, and you have done all that God and humanity require of you.
<p/>Let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) identity, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) connection with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being.
<p/>Place her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in safety and comfort: shelter her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) degradation with secrecy, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).' '' I acted precisely on this suggestion.
<p/>My father and brother had not made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) blush to own her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter-in-law.
<p/>Far from desiring to publish the connection, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) became as anxious to conceal it as myself. '' To England, then, I conveyed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); a fearful voyage I had with such a monster in the vessel.
<p/>Glad was I when I at last got her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to Thornfield, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret inner cabinet she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a goblin's cell.
<p/>I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as it was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed; for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had lucid intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) filled up with abuse of me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and the surgeon, Carter -LRB-who dressed Mason's wounds that night he (<font color='blue'><b>Mason</b></font>) was stabbed and worried-RRB-, are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.
<p/>At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat. Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could have gained no precise knowledge as to facts.
<p/>Grace has, on the whole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) own, of which it appears nothing can cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>), and which is incident to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) harassing profession, her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.
<p/>The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) has never failed to take advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) stabbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) cell, and issue therefrom in the night-time.
<p/>On the first of these occasions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) paid that ghastly visit to you.
<p/>I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) then spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought back vague reminiscences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) own bridal days: but on what might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.
<p/>When I think of the thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--''
<p/>'' And what, sir,'' I asked, while he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) paused, <div class="bookquote">``did you do when you had settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Grace</b></font>) here? Where did you go?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' What did I do, Jane? I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp. Where did I go? I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the March-spirit.
<p/>My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--
<p/>I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its lands. '' '' But you could not marry, sir.'' <div class="bookquote">``I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.
<p/>I meant to tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was burdened.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It was not my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you. '' Well, sir?'' <div class="bookquote">``When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.
<p/>You open your eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted to read the tablet of one's heart.
<p/>It is a small phrase very frequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk:
<p/>But before I go on, tell me what you mean by your `Well, sir?' I don't very well know why.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I mean,--What next?
<p/>How did you proceed? What came of such an event?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>``Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to marry you; and what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to marry me: but what she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate.
<p/>For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence.
<p/>Provided with plenty of money and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were closed against me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen. I could not find her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeserved.
<p/>You are not to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person. I longed only for what suited me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.
<p/>Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have asked to marry me.
<p/>Disappointment made me reckless. I tried dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate. That was my Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) restrained me much, even in pleasure.
<p/>Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach me to her (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>person</b></font>) vices, and I eschewed it. '' Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses.
<p/>The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a man spurn himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) recalls them. You already know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Varens</b></font>) was, and how my liaison with her (<font color='blue'><b>Varens</b></font>) terminated.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Varens</b></font>) had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly handsome. What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?
<p/>Giacinta was unprincipled and violent : I tired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) in three months. Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to my taste.
<p/>I was glad to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) a sufficient sum to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>) up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clara</b></font>).
<p/>But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now. You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?''
<p/>Did it not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one mistress and then another?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir. You talk of it as a mere matter of course.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It was with me; and I did not like it. It was a grovelling fashion of existence: I should never like to return to it.
<p/>Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading.
<p/>I felt the truth of these words; and I drew from them the certain inference, that if I were so far to forget myself and all the teaching that had ever been instilled into me, as--under any pretext--with any justification--through any temptation--to become the successor of these poor girls, he (<font color='blue'><b>successor</b></font>) would one day regard me with the same feeling which now in his (<font color='blue'><b>successor</b></font>) mind desecrated their memory.
<p/>I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine, Giacinta, and Clara. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not give utterance to this conviction: it was enough to feel it.
<p/>I impressed it on my heart, that it might remain there to serve me as aid in the time of trial.
<p/>'' Now, Jane, why don't you say `Well, sir?' I have not done. You are looking grave. You disapprove of me still, I see.
<p/>Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all womankind -LRB-for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream-RRB-, recalled by business, I came back to England.
<p/>But let me come to the point. '' On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall. Abhorred spot!
<p/>I expected no peace--no pleasure there. On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.
<p/>I passed it as negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble guise.
<p/>I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.
<p/>Childish and slender creature! It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to bear me on its tiny wing.
<p/>I was surly; but the thing would not go: it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of authority.
<p/>I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was. '' When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap and sense--stole into my frame.
<p/>I had learnt that this elf must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind the dim hedge, without singular regret.
<p/>I heard you come home that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or watched for you.
<p/>It was well The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an- hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery. It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors.
<p/>Adele claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>), my little Jane; you talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a long time.
<p/>When at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.
<p/>Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed.
<p/>I think those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven.
<p/>The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!
<p/>I was in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch. There was much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction.
<p/>I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.'
<p/>You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was.
<p/>It seemed to say--`My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal. I was vexed with you for getting out of my sight.
<p/>'' Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my presence. An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.
<p/>You entered the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly dressed--much as you are now.
<p/>Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers.
<p/>Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.
<p/>I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more.
<p/>I made you talk: ere long I found you full of strange contrasts. Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely.
<p/>I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of freshness would leave it.
<p/>I did not then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem.
<p/>Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect.
<p/>Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure.
<p/>I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out. ''
<p/>There was something glad in your glance, and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that made you mournful.
<p/>I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent.
<p/>I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner:
<p/>you glanced at me with a slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant.
<p/>I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't talk any more of those days, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, furtively dashing away some tears from my eyes; his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) language was torture to me; for I knew what I must do--and do soon--and all these reminiscences, and these revelations of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) feelings only made my work more difficult.
<p/>No, Jane,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) returned: <div class="bookquote">``what necessity is there to dwell on the Past, when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?
<p/>I resumed my notice of you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' I shuddered to hear the infatuated assertion. '' You see now how the case stands--do you not?
<p/>After a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have found you.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) continued. '' You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel. I am bound to you with a strong attachment.
<p/>a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.
<p/>I think you good, gifted, lovely: '' It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.
<p/>To tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I had but a hideous demon.
<p/>I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character. I feared early instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences.
<p/>This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier existence--shown to you, not my resolution -LRB-that word is weak-RRB-, but my resistless bent to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return.
<p/>Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours. Jane--give it me now.
<p/>'' A pause. '' Why are you silent, Jane? '' I was experiencing an ordeal: a hand of fiery iron grasped my vitals.
<p/>Not a human being that ever lived could wish to be loved better than I was loved; and him (<font color='blue'><b>yours</b></font>) who thus loved me I absolutely worshipped: and I must renounce love and idol.
<p/>Terrible moment: full of struggle, blackness, burning! One drear word comprised my intolerable duty--<div class="bookquote">``Depart!''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div>'' Jane, you understand what I want of you?
<p/>Just this promise--'I will be yours, Mr. Rochester.''' '' Mr. Rochester, I will not be yours. '' Another long silence. ''
<p/>'' recommenced he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), with a gentleness that broke me down with grief, and turned me stone-cold with ominous terror--for this still voice was the pant of a lion
<p/>Jane! rising--<div class="bookquote">``Jane , do you mean to go one way in the world, and to let me go another?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Jane''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>-LRB-bending towards and embracing me-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">``do you mean it now?''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And now?'' softly kissing my forehead and cheek.
<p/>'' I do,'' extricating myself from restraint rapidly and completely. '' Oh, Jane, this is bitter! This--this is wicked. It would not be wicked to love me.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would to obey you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A wild look raised his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) brows--crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) features: he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) rose; but he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) forebore yet. I laid my hand on the back of a chair for support: I shook, I feared--but I resolved.
<p/>'' One instant, Jane. Give one glance to my horrible life when you are gone. All happiness will be torn away with you.
<p/>For a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some corpse in yonder churchyard.
<p/>What then is left? What shall I do, Jane? Where turn for a companion and for some hope?'' <div class="bookquote">``Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.
<p/>Believe in heaven. Hope to meet again there. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you will not yield?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) voice rose. '' I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.'' <div class="bookquote">``Then you snatch love and innocence from me?
<p/>You fling me back on lust for a passion--vice for an occupation?''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for myself.
<p/>We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so. You will forget me before I forget you.''
<p/>``You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour. I declared I could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.
<p/>Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach?
<p/>And what a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved by your conduct! for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?
<p/>This was true: and while he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) spoke my very conscience and reason turned traitors against me, and charged me with crime in resisting him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>).
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Think of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) misery; think of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) danger--look at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) state when left alone; remember his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair--soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>); save him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>); love him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>); tell him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) you love him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) and will be his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>).

<p/>'' Still indomitable was the reply-- '' I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.
<p/>I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man. I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad--as I am now.
<p/>Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be.
<p/>They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs.
<p/>If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth? Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) fury was wrought to the highest: he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) must yield to it for a moment, whatever followed; he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) crossed the floor and seized my arm and grasped my waist.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) seemed to devour me with his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) flaming glance: physically, I felt, at the moment, powerless as stubble exposed to the draught and glow of a furnace: mentally, I still possessed my soul, and with it the certainty of ultimate safety.
<p/>'' I did. Mr. Rochester, reading my countenance, saw I had done so. The soul, fortunately, has an interpreter--often an unconscious, but still a truthful interpreter--in the eye.
<p/>My eye rose to his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>); and while I looked in his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) fierce face I gave an involuntary sigh; his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) gripe was painful, and my over-taxed strength almost exhausted.
<p/>'' Never,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) ground his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) teeth, <div class="bookquote">``never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable.

<p/>Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph.
<p/>-LRB-And he (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) shook me with the force of his (<font color='blue'><b>interpreter</b></font>) hold.-RRB- '' Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful creature!

<p/>Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.
<p/>Oh! come, Jane, come!

The look was far worse to resist than the frantic strain: only an idiot, however, would have succumbed now.
<p/>I had dared and baffled his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) fury; I must elude his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sorrow: I retired to the door. '' You are going, Jane?''

<p/>Then came a deep, strong sob. I had already gained the door; but, reader, I walked back--walked back as determinedly as I had retreated.
<p/>I knelt down by him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>); I turned his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) face from the cushion to me; I kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) cheek; I smoothed his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) hair with my hand.

(<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>* * * * *
<p/>That night I never thought to sleep; but a slumber fell on me as soon as I lay down in bed.
<p/>I dreamt I lay in the red-room at Gateshead; that the night was dark, and my mind impressed with strange fears.
<p/>The light that long ago had struck me into syncope, recalled in this vision, seemed glidingly to mount the wall, and tremblingly to pause in the centre of the obscured ceiling.
<p/>I lifted up my head to look: the roof resolved to clouds, high and dim; the gleam was such as the moon imparts to vapours
<p/>I watched her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) come--watched with the strangest anticipation; as though some word of doom were to be written on her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) disk.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) broke forth as never moon yet burst from cloud: a hand first penetrated the sable folds and waved them away; then, not a moon, but a white human form shone in the azure, inclining a glorious brow earthward.
<p/>I was transported in thought to the scenes of childhood: she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) is about to sever. It gazed and gazed on me.
<p/>It spoke to my spirit: immeasurably distant was the tone, yet so near, it whispered in my heart-- '' My daughter, flee temptation.''
<p/>'' Mother, I will. '' So I answered after I had waked from the trance-like dream. It was yet night, but July nights are short: soon after midnight, dawn comes.
<p/>'' It cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,'' thought I. I rose: I was dressed; for I had taken off nothing but my shoes.
<p/>In seeking these articles, I encountered the beads of a pearl necklace Mr. Rochester had forced me to accept a few days ago.
<p/>I knew where to find in my drawers some linen, a locket, a ring. I left that; it was not mine: it was the visionary bride's who had melted in air.
<p/>The other articles I made up in a parcel; my purse, containing twenty shillings -LRB-it was all I had-RRB-, I put in my pocket: I tied on my straw bonnet, pinned my shawl, took the parcel and my slippers, which I would not put on yet, and stole from my room.
<p/>'' Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax! '' I whispered, as I glided past her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) door. '' Farewell, my darling Adele! '' I said, as I glanced towards the nursery.
<p/>No thought could be admitted of entering to embrace her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>). I had to deceive a fine ear: for aught I knew it might now be listening.
<p/>I would have got past Mr. Rochester's chamber without a pause; but my heart momentarily stopping its beat at that threshold, my foot was forced to stop also.
<p/>No sleep was there: the inmate was walking restlessly from wall to wall; and again and again he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) sighed while I listened.
<p/>There was a heaven--a temporary heaven--in this room for me, if I chose: I had but to go in and to say-- ''
<p/>Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till death,'' and a fount of rapture would spring to my lips.
<p/>I thought of this. That kind master, who could not sleep now, was waiting with impatience for day. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would send for me in the morning; I should be gone.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would have me sought for: vainly. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would feel himself forsaken; his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) love rejected: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would suffer; perhaps grow desperate.
<p/>I thought of this too. My hand moved towards the lock: I caught it back, and glided on. Drearily I wound my way downstairs: I knew what I had to do, and I did it mechanically.
<p/>I sought the key of the side-door in the kitchen; I sought, too, a phial of oil and a feather; I oiled the key and the lock.
<p/>, I got some bread: for perhaps I should have to walk far; and my strength, sorely shaken of late, must not break down.
<p/>I got some water All this I did without one sound. I opened the door, passed out, shut it softly. Dim dawn glimmered in the yard.
<p/>The great gates were closed and locked; but a wicket in one of them was only latched. Through that I departed: it, too, I shut; and now I was out of Thornfield.
<p/>A mile off, beyond the fields, lay a road which stretched in the contrary direction to Millcote; a road I had never travelled, but often noticed, and wondered where it led: thither I bent my steps.
<p/>No reflection was to be allowed now: not one glance was to be cast back; not even one forward. Not one thought was to be given either to the past or the future.
<p/>The first was a page so heavenly sweet--so deadly sad--that to read one line of it would dissolve my courage and break down my energy.
<p/>The last was an awful blank: something like the world when the deluge was gone by. I skirted fields, and hedges, and lanes till after sunrise.
<p/>I believe it was a lovely summer morning: I know my shoes, which I had put on when I left the house, were soon wet with dew.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) who is taken out to pass through a fair scene to the scaffold, thinks not of the flowers that smile on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) road, but of the block and axe-edge; of the disseverment of bone and vein; of the grave gaping at the end: and I thought of drear flight and homeless wandering--
<p/>But I looked neither to rising sun, nor smiling sky, nor wakening nature. and oh! with agony I thought of what I left.
<p/>I thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) now--in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) room--watching the sunrise; hoping I should soon come to say I would stay with him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) and be his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>).
<p/>I could not help it. I longed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ; I panted to return: it was not too late; I could yet spare him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) the bitter pang of bereavement.
<p/>As yet my flight, I was sure, was undiscovered. I could go back and be his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) comforter--his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pride; his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) redeemer from misery, perhaps from ruin.
<p/>It was a barbed arrow-head in my breast; it tore me when I tried to extract it; it sickened me when remembrance thrust it farther in.
<p/>Oh, that fear of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) self-abandonment--far worse than my abandonment--how it goaded me! Birds began singing in brake and copse: birds were faithful to their mates; birds were emblems of love.
<p/>What was I? In the midst of my pain of heart and frantic effort of principle, I abhorred myself. I had no solace from self-approbation: none even from self-respect.
<p/>I had injured--wounded--left my master. I was hateful in my own eyes. Still I could not turn, nor retrace one step.
<p/>God must have led me on. As to my own will or conscience, impassioned grief had trampled one and stifled the other.
<p/>I was weeping wildly as I walked along my solitary way: fast, fast I went like one delirious. A weakness, beginning inwardly, extending to the limbs, seized me, and I fell:
<p/>I had some fear--or hope--that here I should die: but I was soon up; crawling forwards on my hands and knees, and then again raised to my feet--as eager and as determined as ever to reach the road.
<p/>When I got there, I was forced to sit to rest me under the hedge; and while I sat, I heard wheels, and saw a coach come on.
<p/>I lay on the ground some minutes, pressing my face to the wet turf. I stood up and lifted my hand; it stopped.
<p/>I asked where it was going: the driver named a place a long way off, and where I was sure Mr. Rochester had no connections.
<p/>I asked for what sum he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would take me there; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said thirty shillings; I answered I had but twenty; well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would try to make it do.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) further gave me leave to get into the inside, as the vehicle was empty: I entered, was shut in, and it rolled on its way.
<p/>Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine.
<p/>left my lips; for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love.
<p/>May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonised as in that hour CHAPTER XXVIII Two days are passed.
<p/>It is a summer evening; the coachman has set me down at a place called Whitcross; he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) could take me no farther for the sum I had given, and I was not possessed of another shilling in the world.
<p/>At this moment I discover that I forgot to take my parcel out of the pocket of the coach, where I had placed it for safety; there it remains, there it must remain; and now, I am absolutely destitute.
<p/>Whitcross is no town, nor even a hamlet; it is but a stone pillar set up where four roads meet: whitewashed, I suppose, to be more obvious at a distance and in darkness.
<p/>The coach is a mile off by this time; I am alone. Four arms spring from its summit: the nearest town to which these point is,
<p/>From the well-known names of these towns I learn in what county I have lighted; a north-midland shire, dusk with moorland, ridged with mountain: this I see.
<p/>There are great moors behind and on each hand of me; there are waves of mountains far beyond that deep valley at my feet.
<p/>The population here must be thin, and I see no passengers on these roads: they stretch out east, west, north, and south--white, broad, lonely; they are all cut in the moor, and the heather grows deep and wild to their very verge.
<p/>according to the inscription, distant ten miles; the farthest, above twenty. Yet a chance traveller might pass by; and I wish no eye to see me now
<p/>: strangers would wonder what I am doing, lingering here at the sign-post, evidently objectless and lost. I might be questioned: I could give no answer but what would sound incredible and excite suspicion.
<p/>Not a tie holds me to human society at this moment--not a charm or hope calls me where my fellow-creatures are--none that saw me would have a kind thought or a good wish for me.
<p/>I struck straight into the heath; I held on to a hollow I saw deeply furrowing the brown moorside; I waded knee-deep in its dark growth; I turned with its turnings, and finding a moss-blackened granite crag in a hidden angle, I sat down under it.
<p/>I have no relative but the universal mother, Nature: I will seek her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) breast and ask repose. High banks of moor were about me; the crag protected my head: the sky was over that.
<p/>Some time passed before I felt tranquil even here: I had a vague dread that wild cattle might be near, or that some sportsman or poacher might discover me.
<p/>If a gust of wind swept the waste, I looked up, fearing it was the rush of a bull; if a plover whistled, I imagined it a man.
<p/>Finding my apprehensions unfounded, however, and calmed by the deep silence that reigned as evening declined at nightfall, I took confidence.
<p/>As yet I had not thought ; I had only listened, watched, dreaded; now I regained the faculty of reflection. What was I to do?
<p/>Oh, intolerable questions, when I could do nothing and go nowhere!--when a long way must yet be measured by my weary, trembling limbs before I could reach human habitation--when cold charity must be entreated before I could get a lodging: reluctant sympathy importuned, almost certain repulse incurred, before my tale could be listened to, or one of my wants relieved!
<p/>Where to go? I touched the heath: it was dry, and yet warm with the heat of the summer day. I looked at the sky; it was pure: a kindly star twinkled just above the chasm ridge.
<p/>Nature seemed to me benign and good; I thought she (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) loved me, outcast as I was; and I, who from man could anticipate only mistrust, rejection, insult, clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) with filial fondness.
<p/>To-night, at least, I would be her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) guest, as I was her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) child: my mother would lodge me without money and without price.
<p/>the remnant of a roll I had bought in a town we passed through at noon with a stray penny--my last coin.
<p/>I saw ripe bilberries gleaming here and there, like jet beads in the heath: I gathered a handful and ate them with the bread.
<p/>The dew fell, but with propitious softness; no breeze whispered. I had one morsel of bread yet: My hunger, sharp before, was, if not satisfied, appeased by this hermit's meal.
<p/>Beside the crag the heath was very deep: when I lay down my feet were buried in it; rising high on each side, it left only a narrow space for the night-air to invade.
<p/>I said my evening prayers at its conclusion, and then chose my couch. -LCB- I said my evening prayers: p311.jpg-RCB- I folded my shawl double, and spread it over me for a coverlet; a low, mossy swell was my pillow.
<p/>Thus lodged, I was not, at least--at the commencement of the night, cold. My rest might have been blissful enough, only a sad heart broke it.
<p/>It trembled for Mr. Rochester and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) doom; it bemoaned him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) with bitter pity; it demanded him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) with ceaseless longing; and, impotent as a bird with both wings broken, it still quivered its shattered pinions in vain attempts to seek him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>).
<p/>It plained of its gaping wounds, its inward bleeding, its riven chords. Worn out with this torture of thought, I rose to my knees.
<p/>We know that God is everywhere; but certainly we feel His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) presence most when His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) works are on the grandest scale spread before us; and it is in the unclouded night-sky, where His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) worlds wheel their silent course, that we read clearest His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) infinitude, His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) omnipotence, His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) omnipresence.
<p/>Night was come, and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) planets were risen: a safe, still night: too serene for the companionship of fear. I had risen to my knees to pray for Mr. Rochester.
<p/>Remembering what it was--what countless systems there swept space like a soft trace of light--I felt the might and strength of God.
<p/>Sure was I of His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) efficiency to save what He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had made: convinced I grew that neither earth should perish, nor one of the souls it treasured.
<p/>Looking up, I, with tear-dimmed eyes, saw the mighty Milky- way. I turned my prayer to thanksgiving: the Source of Life was also the Saviour of spirits.
<p/>Mr. Rochester was safe; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was God's, and by God would he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) be guarded. I again nestled to the breast of the hill; and ere long in sleep forgot sorrow.
<p/>Long after the little birds had left their nests; long after bees had come in the sweet prime of day to gather the heath honey before the dew was dried--when the long morning shadows were curtailed, and the sun filled earth and sky
<p/>But next day, Want came to me pale and bare. --I got up, and I looked round me. What a still, hot, perfect day!
<p/>What a golden desert this spreading moor! Everywhere sunshine. I wished I could live in it and on it. I saw a lizard run over the crag; I saw a bee busy among the sweet bilberries.
<p/>I would fain at the moment have become bee or lizard, that I might have found fitting nutriment, permanent shelter here.
<p/>But I was a human being, and had a human being's wants: I must not linger where there was nothing to supply them.
<p/>Hopeless of the future, I wished but this--that my Maker had that night thought good to require my soul of me while I slept; and that this weary frame, absolved by death from further conflict with fate, had now but to decay quietly, and mingle in peace with the soil of this wilderness.
<p/>I rose; I looked back at the bed I had left. Life, however, was yet in my possession, with all its requirements, and pains, and responsibilities.
<p/>The burden must be carried; the want provided for; the suffering endured; the responsibility fulfilled. I set out. Whitcross regained, I followed a road which led from the sun, now fervent and high.
<p/>I walked a long time, and when I thought I had nearly done enough, and might conscientiously yield to the fatigue that almost overpowered me--might relax this forced action, and, sitting down on a stone I saw near, submit resistlessly to the apathy that clogged heart and limb
<p/>I turned in the direction of the sound, and there, amongst the romantic hills, whose changes and aspect I had ceased to note an hour ago, I saw a hamlet and a spire.
<p/>All the valley at my right hand was full of pasture- fields, and cornfields, and wood; and a glittering stream ran zig-zag through the varied shades of green, the mellowing grain, the sombre woodland, the clear and sunny lea.
<p/>Recalled by the rumbling of wheels to the road before me, I saw a heavily-laden waggon labouring up the hill, and not far beyond were two cows and their drover.
<p/>By no other circumstance had I will to decide my choice. --I heard a bell chime--a church bell. Human life and human labour were near.
<p/>I must struggle on: strive to live and bend to toil like the rest. About two o'clock p.m. I entered the village.
<p/>At the bottom of its one street there was a little shop with some cakes of bread in the window. I coveted a cake of bread.
<p/>With that refreshment I could perhaps regain a degree of energy: without it, it would be difficult to proceed. The wish to have some strength and some vigour returned to me as soon as I was amongst my fellow-beings.
<p/>I felt it would be degrading to faint with hunger on the causeway of a hamlet. Had I nothing about me I could offer in exchange for one of these rolls?
<p/>I considered. I had a small silk handkerchief tied round my throat; I had my gloves. I could hardly tell how men and women in extremities of destitution proceeded.
<p/>I did not know whether either of these articles would be accepted: probably they would not; but I must try. I entered the shop: a woman was there.
<p/>Seeing a respectably-dressed person, a lady as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) supposed, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came forward with civility. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) serve me? I was seized with shame: my tongue would not utter the request I had prepared.
<p/>I dared not offer her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) the half-worn gloves, the creased handkerchief: besides, I felt it would be absurd. I only begged permission to sit down a moment, as I was tired.
<p/>Disappointed in the expectation of a customer, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) coolly acceded to my request. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) pointed to a seat; I sank into it.
<p/>I felt sorely urged to weep; but conscious how unseasonable such a manifestation would be, I restrained it. Soon I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the village?''
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Yes; two or three. Quite as many as there was employment for. '' I reflected. I was driven to the point now.
<p/>I was brought face to face with Necessity. I stood in the position of one without a resource, without a friend, without a coin.
<p/>I must do something. What? I must apply somewhere. Where? '' Did she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?''
<p/>'' Nay; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) couldn't say. '' '' What was the chief trade in this place? What did most of the people do?''
<p/>'' Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's needle-factory, and at the foundry.'' <div class="bookquote">``Did Mr. Oliver employ women?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Nay ; it was men's work.'' '' And what do the women do?'' <div class="bookquote">``I knawn't,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the answer. '' Some does one thing, and some another.
<p/>Poor folk mun get on as they can. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) seemed to be tired of my questions: and, indeed, what claim had I to importune her (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>)?
<p/>I passed up the street, looking as I went at all the houses to the right hand and to the left; but I could discover no pretext, nor see an inducement to enter any.
<p/>A neighbour or two came in; my chair was evidently wanted. I took leave. I rambled round the hamlet, going sometimes to a little distance and returning again, for an hour or more.
<p/>Much exhausted, and suffering greatly now for want of food, I turned aside into a lane and sat down under the hedge.
<p/>Ere many minutes had elapsed, I was again on my feet, however, and again searching something--a resource, or at least an informant.
<p/>A pretty little house stood at the top of the lane, with a garden before it, exquisitely neat and brilliantly blooming.
<p/>I stopped at it. What business had I to approach the white door or touch the glittering knocker? In what way could it possibly be the interest of the inhabitants of that dwelling to serve me?
<p/>In such a voice as might be expected from a hopeless heart and fainting frame--a voice wretchedly low and faltering--I asked if a servant was wanted here?
<p/>Yet I drew near and knocked. A mild-looking, cleanly-attired young woman opened the door. '' No,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``we do not keep a servant.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I continued. '' I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.
<p/>But it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) business to think for me, or to seek a place for me: besides, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes, how doubtful must have appeared my character, position, tale.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">``was sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could give me no information,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and the white door closed, quite gently and civilly: but it shut me out.
<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had held it open a little longer, I believe I should have begged a piece of bread; for I was now brought low.
<p/>I want some work: no matter what. '' I could not bear to return to the sordid village, where, besides, no prospect of aid was visible.
<p/>I should have longed rather to deviate to a wood I saw not far off, which appeared in its thick shade to offer inviting shelter; but I was so sick, so weak, so gnawed with nature's cravings, instinct kept me roaming round abodes where there was a chance of food.
<p/>I drew near houses; I left them, and came back again, and again I wandered away: always repelled by the consciousness of having no claim to ask--no right to expect interest in my isolated lot.
<p/>Solitude would be no solitude--rest no rest--while the vulture, hunger, thus sank beak and talons in my side. Meantime, the afternoon advanced, while I thus wandered about like a lost and starving dog.
<p/>Near the churchyard, and in the middle of a garden, stood a well-built though small house, which I had no doubt was the parsonage.
<p/>I remembered that strangers who arrive at a place where they have no friends, and who want employment, sometimes apply to the clergyman for introduction and aid.
<p/>In crossing a field, I saw the church spire before me: I hastened towards it. It is the clergyman's function to help--at least with advice--those who wished to help themselves.
<p/>I seemed to have something like a right to seek counsel here. Renewing then my courage, and gathering my feeble remains of strength, I pushed on.
<p/>I reached the house, and knocked at the kitchen-door. An old woman opened: I asked was this the parsonage? <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was the clergyman in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``No.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Would he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) be in soon?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' No, he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was gone from home.'' <div class="bookquote">``To a distance?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not so far--happen three mile.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) had been called away by the sudden death of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) father: he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a fortnight longer.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Nay, there was naught but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was housekeeper;''  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), reader, I could not bear to ask the relief for want of which I was sinking; I could not yet beg; and again I crawled away.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Was there any lady of the house?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Once more I took off my handkerchief--once more I thought of the cakes of bread in the little shop.
<p/>Instinctively I turned my face again to the village; I found the shop again, and I went in; and though others were there besides the woman I ventured the request--<div class="bookquote">``Would she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) give me a roll for this handkerchief?
<p/>Oh, for but a crust! for but one mouthful to allay the pang of famine! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked at me with evident suspicion: <div class="bookquote">``Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) never sold stuff
<p/>i' that way. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Almost desperate, I asked for half a cake; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) again refused. '' How could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) tell where I had got the handkerchief?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) said. '' Would she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) take my gloves?'' '' No! what could she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) do with them?'' Reader, it is not pleasant to dwell on these details.
<p/>Some say there is enjoyment in looking back to painful experience past; but at this day I can scarcely bear to review the times to which I allude: the moral degradation, blent with the physical suffering, form too distressing a recollection ever to be willingly dwelt on.
<p/>I felt it was what was to be expected, and what could not be helped: an ordinary beggar is frequently an object of suspicion; a well-dressed beggar inevitably so.
<p/>I blamed none of those who repulsed me. To be sure, what I begged was employment; but whose business was it to provide me with employment?
<p/>And as to the woman who would not take my handkerchief in exchange for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) bread, why, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was right, if the offer appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sinister or the exchange unprofitable.
<p/>Not, certainly, that of persons who saw me then for the first time, and who knew nothing about my character. Let me condense now.
<p/>A little before dark I passed a farm-house, at the open door of which the farmer was sitting, eating his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) supper of bread and cheese.
<p/>I am sick of the subject. I stopped and said-- <div class="bookquote">``Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) cast on me a glance of surprise; but without answering, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) cut a thick slice from his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) loaf, and gave it to me.
<p/>I imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) did not think I was a beggar, but only an eccentric sort of lady, who had taken a fancy to his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) brown loaf.
<p/>I could not hope to get a lodging under a roof, and sought it in the wood I have before alluded to.
<p/>But my night was wretched, my rest broken: the ground was damp, the air cold: besides, intruders passed near me more than once, and I had again and again to change my quarters; no sense of safety or tranquillity befriended me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As soon as I was out of sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) house, I sat down and ate it. Towards morning it rained; the whole of the following day was wet.
<p/>Do not ask me, reader, to give a minute account of that day; as before, I sought work; as before, I was repulsed; as before, I starved; but once did food pass my lips.
<p/>At the door of a cottage I saw a little girl about to throw a mess of cold porridge into a pig trough.
<p/>'' Will you give me that? '' I asked. -LCB-<div class="bookquote">``Will you give me that?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked: p316.jpg-RCB- She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stared at me.
<p/>'' Mother!'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) exclaimed, <div class="bookquote">``there is a woman wants me to give her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) these porridge.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Well lass,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>replied a voice within, <div class="bookquote">``give it her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)'s a beggar.
<p/>T' pig doesn't want it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>The girl</b></font>)</div>The girl emptied the stiffened mould into my hand, and I devoured it ravenously. As the wet twilight deepened, I stopped in a solitary bridle-path, which I had been pursuing an hour or more.
<p/>'' My strength is quite failing me,'' I said in a soliloquy. '' I feel I cannot go much farther. Shall I be an outcast again this night?
<p/>While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground? I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?
<p/>But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation--this total prostration of hope.
<p/>In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning. And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death? Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life?
<p/>Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.
<p/>Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer! Aid!--direct me! '' My glazed eye wandered over the dim and misty landscape. I saw I had strayed far from the village: it was quite out of sight.
<p/>I had, by cross-ways and by- paths, once more drawn near the tract of moorland; and now, only a few fields, almost as wild and unproductive as the heath from which they were scarcely reclaimed, lay between me and the dusky hill.
<p/>The very cultivation surrounding it had disappeared. '' Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road,'' I reflected.
<p/>And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's grave.
<p/>It remained now only to find a hollow where I could lie down, and feel at least hidden, if not secure.
<p/>It showed no variation but of tint: green, where rush and moss overgrew the marshes; black, where the dry soil bore only heath.
<p/>Dark as it was getting, I could still see these changes, though but as mere alternations of light and shade; for colour had faded with the daylight.
<p/>My eye still roved over the sullen swell and along the moor-edge, vanishing amidst the wildest scenery, when at one dim point, far in among the marshes and the ridges, a light sprang up.
<p/>'' '' To the hill, then, I turned. I reached it. But all the surface of the waste looked level. ''
<p/>That is an ignis fatuus ,'' was my first thought; and I expected it would soon vanish. It burnt on, however, quite steadily, neither receding nor advancing.
<p/>'' Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled? '' I questioned. I watched to see whether it would spread: but no; as it did not diminish, so it did not enlarge.
<p/>'' It may be a candle in a house,'' I then conjectured; <div class="bookquote">``but if so, I can never reach it. It is much too far away: and were it within a yard of me,
<p/>what would it avail? I should but knock at the door to have it shut in my face. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And I sank down where I stood, and hid my face against the ground.
<p/>I lay still a while: the night-wind swept over the hill and over me, and died moaning in the distance; the rain fell fast, wetting me afresh to the skin.
<p/>Could I but have stiffened to the still frost--the friendly numbness of death--it might have pelted on; I should not have felt it; but my yet living flesh shuddered at its chilling influence.
<p/>I rose ere long. The light was yet there, shining dim but constant through the rain. I tried to walk again: I dragged my exhausted limbs slowly towards it.
<p/>It led me aslant over the hill, through a wide bog, which would have been impassable in winter, and was splashy and shaking even now, in the height of summer.
<p/>Here I fell twice; but as often I rose and rallied my faculties. This light was my forlorn hope: I must gain it.
<p/>I approached it; it was a road or a track: it led straight up to the light, which now beamed from a sort of knoll, amidst a clump of trees--firs, apparently, from what I could distinguish of the character of their forms and foliage through the gloom.
<p/>Having crossed the marsh, I saw a trace of white over the moor. My star vanished as I drew near: some obstacle had intervened between me and it.
<p/>I put out my hand to feel the dark mass before me: I discriminated the rough stones of a low wall--above it, something like palisades, and within, a high and prickly hedge.
<p/>Again a whitish object gleamed before me: it was a gate--a wicket; it moved on its hinges as I touched it.
<p/>Entering the gate and passing the shrubs, the silhouette of a house rose to view, black, low, and rather long; but the guiding light shone nowhere.
<p/>I groped on. On each side stood a sable bush-holly or yew. All was obscurity. Were the inmates retired to rest?
<p/>In seeking the door, I turned an angle: there shot out the friendly gleam again, from the lozenged panes of a very small latticed window, within a foot of the ground, made still smaller by the growth of ivy or some other creeping plant, whose leaves clustered thick over the portion of the house wall in which it was set.
<p/>The aperture was so screened and narrow, that curtain or shutter had been deemed unnecessary; and when I stooped down and put aside the spray of foliage shooting over it, I could see all within.
<p/>I could see clearly a room with a sanded floor, clean scoured; a dresser of walnut, with pewter plates ranged in rows, reflecting the redness and radiance of a glowing peat-fire.
<p/>The candle, whose ray had been my beacon, burnt on the table; and by its light an elderly woman, somewhat rough-looking, but scrupulously clean, like all about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), was knitting a stocking.
<p/>I feared it must be so. I could see a clock, a white deal table, some chairs. I noticed these objects cursorily only--in them there was nothing extraordinary.
<p/>Two young, graceful women--ladies in every point--sat, one in a low rocking-chair, the other on a lower stool; both wore deep mourning of crape and bombazeen, which sombre garb singularly set off very fair necks and faces: a large old pointer dog rested its massive head on the knee of one girl--in the lap of the other was cushioned a black cat.
<p/>A group of more interest appeared near the hearth, sitting still amidst the rosy peace and warmth suffusing it. A strange place was this humble kitchen for such occupants!
<p/>They could not be the daughters of the elderly person at the table; for she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) looked like a rustic, and they were all delicacy and cultivation.
<p/>I had nowhere seen such faces as theirs: and yet, as I gazed on them, I seemed intimate with every lineament.
<p/>I cannot call them handsome--they were too pale and grave for the word: as they each bent over a book, they looked thoughtful almost to severity.
<p/>A stand between them supported a second candle and two great volumes, to which they frequently referred, comparing them, seemingly, with the smaller books they held in their hands, like people consulting a dictionary to aid them in the task of translation.
<p/>This scene was as silent as if all the figures had been shadows and the firelit apartment a picture: so hushed was it, I could hear the cinders fall from the grate,
<p/>Who were they? the clock tick in its obscure corner; and I even fancied I could distinguish the click-click of the woman's knitting-needles.
<p/>Listen, Diana,'' said one of the absorbed students; <div class="bookquote">``Franz and old Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which he (<font color='blue'><b>Franz</b></font>) has awakened in terror--listen!
<p/>And in a low voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) read something, of which not one word was intelligible to me; for it was in an unknown tongue--neither French nor Latin.
<p/>When, therefore, a voice broke the strange stillness at last, it was audible enough to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>the students</b></font>)</div>'' Whether it were Greek or German I could not tell.
<p/>The other girl, who had lifted her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) sister, repeated, while she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) gazed at the fire, a line of what had been read.
<p/>At a later day, I knew the language and the book; therefore, I will here quote the line: though, when I first heard it, it was only like a stroke on sounding brass to me--conveying no meaning:-- '''
<p/>'' That is strong,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) said, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had finished: <div class="bookquote">``I relish it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'
<p/>Good! good! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) exclaimed, while her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dark and deep eye sparkled. '' There you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!
<p/>The line is worth a hundred pages of fustian. ' Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'
<p/>I like it!'' Both were again silent. '' Is there ony country where they talk i' that way? '' asked the old woman, looking up from her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knitting.
<p/>'' Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no other way. '' '' Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t'

<p/>We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say; and then we shall get more money than we do now.
<p/>'' And what good does it do you?'' '' '' '' Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think we have: at least I'm tired. Mary, are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon.''
<p/>``Surely he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will not be long now: it is just ten -LRB-looking at a little gold watch she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) girdle-RRB-.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home.''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>It rains fast, Hannah: will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?''
<p/>The woman rose: she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opened a door, through which I dimly saw a passage: soon I heard her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stir a fire in an inner room; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) presently came back.
<p/>'' Ah, childer! '' said she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now: it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wiped her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) eyes with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) apron: the two girls, grave before, looked sad now. '' But he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is in a better place,'' continued Hannah: <div class="bookquote">``we shouldn't wish him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) here again.
<p/>And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>'' You say he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) never mentioned us? '' inquired one of the ladies.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when Mr. St. John asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would like either o' ye to be sent for, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fair laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) began again with a bit of a heaviness in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head the next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went to sleep and niver wakened: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wor a`most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and fand him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hadn't time, bairn: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was gone in a minute, was your father. Ah, childer! i' your way, and a`most as book-learned.
<p/>I thought them so similar I could not tell where the old servant -LRB-for such I now concluded her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to be-RRB- saw the difference.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wor the pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father. '' Both were fair complexioned and slenderly made; both possessed faces full of distinction and intelligence.
<p/>One, to be sure, had hair a shade darker than the other, and there was a difference in their style of wearing it; Mary's pale brown locks were parted and braided smooth: Diana's duskier tresses covered her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) neck with thick curls.
<p/>The clock struck ten. '' Ye'll want your supper, I am sure,'' observed Hannah; <div class="bookquote">``and so will Mr. St. John when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) comes in.
<p/>Till this moment, I had been so intent on watching them, their appearance and conversation had excited in me so keen an interest
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) proceeded to prepare the meal. The ladies rose; they seemed about to withdraw to the parlour. , I had half-forgotten my own wretched position: now it recurred to me.
<p/>And how impossible did it appear to touch the inmates of this house with concern on my behalf; to make them believe in the truth of my wants and woes--to induce them to vouchsafe a rest for my wanderings!
<p/>As I groped out the door, and knocked at it hesitatingly, I felt that last idea to be a mere chimera.
<p/>More desolate, more desperate than ever, it seemed from contrast. Hannah opened. '' What do you want? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) inquired, in a voice of surprise, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) surveyed me by the light of the candle she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) held.
<p/>'' May I speak to your mistresses? '' I said. '' You had better tell me what you have to say to them.
<p/>Where do you come from?'' <div class="bookquote">``I am a stranger. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' What is your business here at this hour?'' <div class="bookquote">``I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of bread to eat.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Distrust, the very feeling I dreaded, appeared in Hannah's face. '' I'll give you a piece of bread,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) said, after a pause;
<p/><div class="bookquote">``but we can't take in a vagrant to lodge. It isn't likely.''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do let me speak to your mistresses.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' No, not I.
<p/>What can they do for you? You should not be roving about now; it looks very ill.'' '' But where shall I go if you drive me away?
<p/>What shall I do?'' '' Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do. Mind you don't do wrong, that's all.
<p/>Here is a penny; now go--'' '' A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther. Don't shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must; the rain is driving in-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell the young ladies. Let me see them--''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed, I will not. You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't make such a noise.

<p/>If you've any followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and guns.
<p/>, that bring you about folk's houses at this time o' night. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Here the honest but inflexible servant clapped the door to and bolted it within.
<p/>This was the climax. A pang of exquisite suffering--a throe of true despair--rent and heaved my heart. Worn out, indeed, I was; not another step could I stir.
<p/>I sank on the wet doorstep: I groaned-- I wrung my hands--I wept in utter anguish. Oh, this spectre of death!
<p/>Not only the anchor of hope, but the footing of fortitude was gone--at least for a moment; but the last I soon endeavoured to regain.
<p/>Oh, this last hour, approaching in such horror! Alas, this isolation--this banishment from my kind! '' I can but die,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``and I believe in God.
<p/>These words I not only thought, but uttered; and thrusting back all my misery into my heart, I made an effort to compel it to remain there--dumb and still.
<p/>All men must die,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said a voice quite close at hand; <div class="bookquote">``but all are not condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be if you perished here of want.
<p/>Let me try to wait His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will in silence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' '' '' Who or what speaks? '' I asked, terrified at the unexpected sound, and incapable now of deriving from any occurrence a hope of aid.
<p/>A form was near--what form, the pitch-dark night and my enfeebled vision prevented me from distinguishing. With a loud long knock, the new-comer appealed to the door.
<p/>'' Is it you, Mr. St. John? '' cried Hannah. '' Yes--yes; open quickly. '' '' Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!
<p/>Come in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad folks about. There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) is not gone yet!--laid down there.
<p/>Get up! for shame! Move off, I say!'' <div class="bookquote">``Hush, Hannah! I have a word to say to the woman. You have done your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
<p/>I was near, and listened to both you and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). I think this is a peculiar case--I must at least examine into it.
<p/>Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div>-LCB-Hush, Hannah ; I have a word to say to the woman: p323.jpg-RCB- With difficulty I obeyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>).
<p/>Presently I stood within that clean, bright kitchen--on the very hearth--trembling, sickening; conscious of an aspect in the last degree ghastly, wild, and weather-beaten.
<p/>The two ladies, their brother, Mr. St. John, the old servant, were all gazing at me. '' St. John, who is it?''
<p/>I heard one ask. '' I cannot tell: I found her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) at the door,'' was the reply. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does look white,'' said Hannah.
<p/>'' As white as clay or death,'' was responded. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) will fall: let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) sit. '' And indeed my head swam: I dropped, but a chair received me.
<p/>I still possessed my senses, though just now I could not speak. '' Perhaps a little water would restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>). Hannah, fetch some.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) is worn to nothing. How very thin, and how very bloodless!'' '' A mere spectre!'' <div class="bookquote">``Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) ill, or only famished?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Diana</b></font>)</div><p/>Diana -LRB-I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) by the long curls which I saw drooping between me and the fire as she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) bent over me-RRB- broke some bread, dipped it in milk, and put it to my lips.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Famished, I think. Hannah, is that milk? Give it me, and a piece of bread. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) face was near mine: I saw there was pity in it, and I felt sympathy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) hurried breathing.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) simple words, too, the same balm-like emotion spoke: <div class="bookquote">``Try to eat.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes--try,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ann/Mary Ann Wilson</b></font>)</div>repeated Mary gently; and Mary's hand removed my sodden bonnet and lifted my head.
<p/>I tasted what they offered me: feebly at first, eagerly soon. '' Not too much at first--restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),'' said the brother; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has had enough.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>the brother</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) withdrew the cup of milk and the plate of bread. '' A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``No more at present, sister. Try if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) can speak now--ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) name. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I felt I could speak, and I answered--<div class="bookquote">``My
<p/>name is Jane Elliott. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Anxious as ever to avoid discovery, I had before resolved to assume an alias . ''
<p/>And where do you live? Where are your friends? '' I was silent. '' Can we send for any one you know?
<p/>Somehow, now that I had once crossed the threshold of this house, and once was brought face to face with its owners, I felt no longer outcast, vagrant, and disowned by the wide world.
<p/>'' I shook my head. '' What account can you give of yourself? '' I dared to put off the mendicant--to resume my natural manner and character.
<p/>I began once more to know myself; and when Mr. St. John demanded an account--which at present I was far too weak to render--I said after a brief pause-- <div class="bookquote">``Sir, I can give you no details to-night.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But what, then,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``do you expect me to do for you?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Nothing,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied. My strength sufficed for but short answers.
<p/>Diana took the word-- <div class="bookquote">``Do you mean,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``that we have now given you what aid you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had, I thought, a remarkable countenance, instinct both with power and goodness. I took sudden courage.
<p/>If I were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.
<p/>Answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) compassionate gaze with a smile, I said--<div class="bookquote">``I will trust you. Do with me and for me as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short
<p/>Hannah,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said Mr. St. John, at last, <div class="bookquote">``let her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) sit there at present, and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) no questions; in ten minutes more, give her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) the remainder of that milk and bread.
<p/>--I feel a spasm when I speak. ''  (<font color='red'><b>St. John/Mr. St. John/Mr. John</b></font>)</div>All three surveyed me, and all three were silent. '' Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the matter over.
<p/>'' They withdrew. Very soon one of the ladies returned--I could not tell which. A kind of pleasant stupor was stealing over me as I sat by the genial fire.
<p/>Ere long, with the servant's aid, I contrived to mount a staircase; my dripping clothes were removed; soon a warm, dry bed received me.
<p/>In an undertone she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) gave some directions to Hannah. I thanked God--experienced amidst unutterable exhaustion a glow of grateful joy--and slept.
<p/>CHAPTER XXIX The recollection of about three days and nights succeeding this is very dim in my mind. I can recall some sensations felt in that interval; but few thoughts framed, and no actions performed.
<p/>To that bed I seemed to have grown; I lay on it motionless as a stone; and to have torn me from it would have been almost to kill me.
<p/>I knew I was in a small room and in a narrow bed. I took no note of the lapse of time--of the change from morning to noon, from noon to evening.
<p/>I observed when any one entered or left the apartment: I could even tell who they were; I could understand what was said when the speaker stood near to me; but I could not answer; to open my lips or move my limbs was equally impossible.
<p/>I had a feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wished me away: that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) did not understand me or my circumstances; that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was prejudiced against me.
<p/>Hannah, the servant, was my most frequent visitor. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) coming disturbed me. Diana and Mary appeared in the chamber once or twice a day.
<p/>Yes; she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) been left out all night.
<p/>They would whisper sentences of this sort at my bedside-- <div class="bookquote">``It is very well we took her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) in.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I wonder what she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) has gone through?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) manner of speaking; her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) accent was quite pure; and the clothes she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) took off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.''
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>``She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) physiognomy would be agreeable.
<p/>Never once in their dialogues did I hear a syllable of regret at the hospitality they had extended to me, or of suspicion of, or aversion to, myself.
<p/>Mr. St. John came but once: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looked at me, and said my state of lethargy was the result of reaction from excessive and protracted fatigue.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' I was comforted. He (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) pronounced it needless to send for a doctor: nature, he (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) was sure, would manage best, left to herself.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) said every nerve had been overstrained in some way, and the whole system must sleep torpid a while. There was no disease.
<p/>These opinions he (<font color='blue'><b>wanderer</b></font>) delivered in a few words, in a quiet, low voice; and added, after a pause, in the tone of a man little accustomed to expansive comment, <div class="bookquote">``Rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imagined my recovery would be rapid enough when once commenced. ''  (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>'' Far otherwise,'' responded Diana. '' To speak truth, St. John, my heart rather warms to the poor little soul.
<p/>You will find she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) friends, and has probably injudiciously left them.
<p/>We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) to them, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) face which make me sceptical of her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) tractability.
<p/>I wish we may be able to benefit her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) permanently. '' '' That is hardly likely,'' was the reply. '' ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stood considering me some minutes; then added, <div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) looks sensible, but not at all handsome.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is so ill, St. John.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Ill or well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) would always be plain. The grace and harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features.
<p/>'' On the third day I was better; on the fourth, I could speak, move, rise in bed, and turn. Hannah had brought me some gruel and dry toast, about, as I supposed, the dinner-hour.
<p/>I had eaten with relish: the food was good--void of the feverish flavour which had hitherto poisoned what I had swallowed.
<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) left me, I felt comparatively strong and revived: ere long satiety of repose and desire for action stirred me.
<p/>I wished to rise; but what could I put on? Only my damp and bemired apparel; in which I had slept on the ground and fallen in the marsh.
<p/>I felt ashamed to appear before my benefactors so clad. I was spared the humiliation. On a chair by the bedside were all my own things, clean and dry.
<p/>The traces of the bog were removed from it; the creases left by the wet smoothed out: it was quite decent.
<p/>My black silk frock hung against the wall. My very shoes and stockings were purified and rendered presentable. There were the means of washing in the room, and a comb and brush to smooth my hair.
<p/>My clothes hung loose on me; for I was much wasted, but I covered deficiencies with a shawl, and once more, clean and respectable looking--
<p/>no speck of the dirt, no trace of the disorder I so hated, and which seemed so to degrade me, left
<p/>--I crept down a stone staircase with the aid of the banisters, to a narrow low passage, and found my way presently to the kitchen.
<p/>After a weary process, and resting every five minutes, I succeeded in dressing myself. It was full of the fragrance of new bread and the warmth of a generous fire.
<p/>Prejudices, it is well known, are most difficult to eradicate from the heart whose soil has never been loosened or fertilised by education: they grow there, firm as weeds among stones.
<p/>Hannah had been cold and stiff, indeed, at the first: latterly she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) had begun to relent a little; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) saw me come in tidy and well-dressed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) even smiled.
<p/>Hannah was baking. '' What, you have got up! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) said. '' You are better, then. You may sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) pointed to the rocking-chair: I took it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) bustled about, examining me every now and then with the corner of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) eye.
<p/>Turning to me, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) took some loaves from the oven, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) asked bluntly-- <div class="bookquote">``Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?
<p/>I was indignant for a moment; but remembering that anger was out of the question, and that I had indeed appeared as a beggar to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>), I answered quietly, but still not without a certain marked firmness--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar. I am no beggar; any more than yourself or your young ladies.
<p/>The want of house or brass -LRB-by which I suppose you mean money-RRB- does not make a beggar in your sense of the word.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' After a pause she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I dunnut understand that: you've like no house, nor no brass, I guess?''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Are you book-learned?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) inquired presently. '' Yes, very. '' '' But you've never been to a boarding-school?'' <div class="bookquote">``I was at a boarding-school eight years.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) eyes wide. '' Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?'' <div class="bookquote">``I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.
<p/>What are you going to do with these gooseberries? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I inquired, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) brought out a basket of the fruit.
<p/>'' Mak' 'em into pies. '' <div class="bookquote">``Give them to me and I'll pick them.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Nay ; I dunnut want ye to do nought.''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) consented; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) even brought me a clean towel to spread over my dress, <div class="bookquote">``lest,''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I should mucky it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But I must do something. Let me have them. '' <div class="bookquote">``Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) remarked.
<p/>And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we are.''
<p/>'' Happen ye've been a dressmaker?'' '' No, you are wrong. '' Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Nay; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) doesn't live here: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is only staying a while.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is at home, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own parish at Morton.'' '' That village a few miles off? <div class="bookquote">``Aye.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And what is he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)?'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is a parson. '' I remembered the answer of the old housekeeper at the parsonage, when I had asked to see the clergyman.
<p/>'' This, then, was his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) father's residence?'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) father, and grandfather, and gurt -LRB-great-RRB- grandfather afore him (<font color='blue'><b>grandfather</b></font>).''
 (<font color='red'><b>that gentleman</b></font>)</div><p/>'' The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?'' <div class="bookquote">``Aye; St. John is like his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) kirstened name.''  (<font color='red'><b>sisters</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>And his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?'' <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>'' Their father is dead?'' '' Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke.''
<p/>'' They have no mother?'' '' The mistress has been dead this mony a year. '' <div class="bookquote">``Have you lived with the family long?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I've lived here thirty year. I nursed them all three.''  (<font color='red'><b>an servant</b></font>)</div>'' That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.
<p/>I will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a beggar. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) again regarded me with a surprised stare.
<p/>I believe,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats goes about, you mun forgie me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And though,'' I continued, rather severely, <div class="bookquote">``you wished to turn me from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' '' Well, it was hard: but what can a body do? I thought more o' th' childer nor of mysel: poor things!
<p/>They've like nobody to tak' care on 'em but me. I'm like to look sharpish. '' I maintained a grave silence for some minutes.
<p/>'' You munnut think too hardly of me,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) again remarked. '' But I do think hardly of you,'' I said; <div class="bookquote">``and
<p/>I'll tell you why--not so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no `brass' and no house.
<p/>Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>No more I ought,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) floury and horny hand into mine; another and heartier smile illumined her (<font color='blue'><b>impostor</b></font>) rough face, and from that moment we were friends.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You look a raight down dacent little crater.'' '' That will do--I forgive you now. Shake hands. '' Hannah was evidently fond of talking.
<p/>While I picked the fruit, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) made the paste for the pies, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) proceeded to give me sundry details about her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) deceased master and mistress, and <div class="bookquote">``the childer,''  (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) called the young people.
<p/>Old Mr. Rivers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) said, was a plain man enough, but a gentleman, and of as ancient a family as could be found.
<p/>Marsh End had belonged to the Rivers ever since it was a house: and it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) affirmed, ``aboon two hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.
<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) could remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers wor gentry i' th' owd days o ' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry.
<p/>Still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) allowed, <div class="bookquote">``the owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>'' The mistress was different. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) was a great reader, and studied a deal; and the <div class="bookquote">``bairns''  (<font color='red'><b>a reader bairns</b></font>)</div>had taken after her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).
<p/>There was nothing like them in these parts, nor ever had been; they had liked learning, all three, almost from the time they could speak; and they had always been ``of a mak' of their own.
<p/>Mr. St. John, when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) grew up, would go to college and be a parson; and the girls, as soon as they left school, would seek places as governesses: for they had told her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) their father had some years ago lost a great deal of money by a man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had trusted turning bankrupt; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now not rich enough to give them fortunes, they must provide for themselves.
<p/>They had lived very little at home for a long while, and were only come now to stay a few weeks on account of their father's death; but they did so like Marsh End and Morton, and all these moors and hills about.
<p/>They had been in London, and many other grand towns; but they always said there was no place like home; and then they were so agreeable with each other--never fell out nor <div class="bookquote">``threaped.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) did not know where there was such a family for being united. Having finished my task of gooseberry picking, I asked where the two ladies and their brother were now.
<p/>'' Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour to tea. '' They returned within the time Hannah had allotted them: they entered by the kitchen door.
<p/>Mary, in a few words, kindly and calmly expressed the pleasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt in seeing me well enough to be able to come down; Diana took my hand: she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) head at me.
<p/>Mr. St. John, when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) saw me, merely bowed and passed through; the two ladies stopped: '' You should have waited for my leave to descend,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said.
<p/>'' You still look very pale--and so thin! Poor child!--poor girl! '' Diana had a voice toned, to my ear, like the cooing of a dove.
<p/>Mary's countenance was equally intelligent--her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) features equally pretty; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) expression was more reserved, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) manners, though gentle, more distant.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) possessed eyes whose gaze I delighted to encounter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) whole face seemed to me full of charm. Diana looked and spoke with a certain authority
<p/>It was my nature to feel pleasure in yielding to an authority supported like hers, and to bend, where my conscience and self-respect permitted, to an active will.
<p/>: she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had a will, evidently. '' And what business have you here? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) continued. '' It is not your place.
<p/>Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the parlour.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am very well here.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Besides, the fire is too hot for you,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ann/Mary Ann Wilson</b></font>)</div>interposed Mary.
<p/>'' To be sure,'' added her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister. '' Come, you must be obedient. '' And still holding my hand she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made me rise, and led me into the inner room.
<p/>Sit there,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, placing me on the sofa, <div class="bookquote">``while we take our things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) closed the door, leaving me solus with Mr. St. John, who sat opposite, a book or newspaper in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' I examined first, the parlour, and then its occupant. The parlour was rather a small room, very plainly furnished, yet comfortable, because clean and neat.
<p/>A few strange, antique portraits of the men and women of other days decorated the stained walls; a cupboard with glass doors contained some books and an ancient set of china.
<p/>There was no superfluous ornament in the room--not one modern piece of furniture, save a brace of workboxes and a lady's desk in rosewood, which stood on a side-table: everything--including the carpet and curtains--looked at once well worn and well saved.
<p/>Mr. St. John--sitting as still as one of the dusty pictures on the walls, keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes fixed on the page he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) perused, and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lips mutely sealed--was easy enough to examine.
<p/>The old-fashioned chairs were very bright, and the walnut-wood table was like a looking-glass. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) been a statue instead of a man, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could not have been easier.
<p/>; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face riveted the eye; it was like a Greek face, very pure in outline: quite a straight, classic nose; quite an Athenian mouth and chin.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was young--perhaps from twenty- eight to thirty--tall, slender It is seldom, indeed, an English face comes so near the antique models as did his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes were large and blue, with brown lashes; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) high forehead, colourless as ivory, was partially streaked over by careless locks of fair hair.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might well be a little shocked at the irregularity of my lineaments, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own being so harmonious. This is a gentle delineation, is it not, reader?
<p/>Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) whom it describes scarcely impressed one with the idea of a gentle, a yielding, an impressible, or even of a placid nature.
<p/>Quiescent as he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) now sat, there was something about his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) nostril, his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) mouth, his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) brow, which, to my perceptions, indicated elements within either restless, or hard, or eager.
<p/>Diana, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) passed in and out, in the course of preparing tea, brought me a little cake, baked on the top of the oven.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) did not speak to me one word, nor even direct to me one glance, till his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) sisters returned. '' Eat that now,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``you must be hungry.
<p/>Hannah says you have had nothing but some gruel since breakfast. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I did not refuse it, for my appetite was awakened and keen.
<p/>Mr. Rivers now closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) book, approached the table, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) took a seat, fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) blue pictorial-looking eyes full on me.
<p/>There was an unceremonious directness, a searching, decided steadfastness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) gaze now, which told that intention, and not diffidence, had hitherto kept it averted from the stranger.
<p/>'' You are very hungry,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) said. '' I am, sir. '' It is my way--it always was my way, by instinct--ever to meet the brief with brevity, the direct with plainness.
<p/>It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings of your appetite at first.
<p/>'' Now you may eat, though still not immoderately.'' <div class="bookquote">``I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was my very clumsily- contrived, unpolished answer.
<p/>No,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) said coolly: <div class="bookquote">``when you have indicated to us the residence of your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being absolutely without home and friends.
<p/>'' The three looked at me, but not distrustfully ; I felt there was no suspicion in their glances: there was more of curiosity.
<p/>I speak particularly of the young ladies. St. John's eyes, though clear enough in a literal sense, in a figurative one were difficult to fathom.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed to use them rather as instruments to search other people's thoughts, than as agents to reveal his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own: the which combination of keenness and reserve was considerably more calculated to embarrass than to encourage.
<p/>Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess to admittance under any roof in England.
<p/>'' Do you mean to say,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``that you are completely isolated from every connection?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``A most singular position at your age!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Here I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) glance directed to my hands, which were folded on the table before me. I wondered what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sought there: his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) words soon explained the quest.
<p/>'' You have never been married? You are a spinster? '' Diana laughed. '' Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old, St. John,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>).
<p/>I felt a burning glow mount to my face; for bitter and agitating recollections were awakened by the allusion to marriage.
<p/>Diana and Mary relieved me by turning their eyes elsewhere than to my crimsoned visage; but the colder and sterner brother continued to gaze, till the trouble he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had excited forced out tears as well as colour.
<p/>'' I am near nineteen: but I am not married. No. '' They all saw the embarrassment and the emotion. ''
<p/>You are too inquisitive, St. John,'' murmured Mary in a low voice; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) leaned over the table and required an answer by a second firm and piercing look.
<p/>Where did you last reside? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now asked. '' '' The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my secret,'' I replied concisely.
<p/>Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from St. John and every other questioner,'' remarked Diana.
<p/>'' '' Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said. '' And you need help, do you not?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life.
<p/>I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' First, then, tell me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you can do. '' I had now swallowed my tea.
<p/>I was mightily refreshed by the beverage; as much so as a giant with wine: it gave new tone to my unstrung nerves, and enabled me to address this penetrating young judge steadily.
<p/>Mr. Rivers,'' I said, turning to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>), and looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) looked at me, openly and without diffidence, <div class="bookquote">``you and your sisters have done me a great service--the greatest man can do his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow-being; you have rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death.
<p/>This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence.
<p/>I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman. My parents died before I could know them. I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable institution.
<p/>I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum, --shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>``I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.
<p/>I obtained a good situation, and was happy. This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here.
<p/>The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible.
<p/>Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature.
<p/>I observed but two points in planning my departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to Whitcross.
<p/>No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three. To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.
<p/>I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.
<p/>I know all your sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Don't make her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) talk any more now, St. John,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana</b></font>)</div>said Diana, as I paused; <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is evidently not yet fit for excitement.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Come to the sofa and sit down now, Miss Elliott. '' I gave an involuntary half start at hearing the alias : I had forgotten my new name.
<p/>Mr. Rivers, whom nothing seemed to escape, noticed it at once. '' You said your name was Jane Elliott? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) observed.
<p/>I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it sounds strange to me.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Your real name you will not give?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would lead to it, I avoid.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You are quite right , I am sure,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana</b></font>)</div>said Diana. '' Now do, brother, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) be at peace a while.
<p/>'' But when St. John had mused a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) recommenced as imperturbably and with as much acumen as ever.
<p/>You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion, and, above all, with my charity
<p/>'' -LRB-I am quite sensible of the distinction drawn, nor do I resent it --it is just-RRB-: you desire to be independent of us?''
<p/>Show me how to work, or how to seek work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do: I have already said so. : I dread another essay of the horrors of homeless destitution.''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Indeed you shall stay here,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana</b></font>)</div>said Diana, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) white hand on my head.
<p/>My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,'' said Mr. St. John, <div class="bookquote">``as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.
<p/>I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>St. John/Mr. St. John/Mr. John</b></font>)</div>You shall ,'' repeated Mary, in the tone of undemonstrative sincerity which seemed natural to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). '' I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort.
<p/>And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can offer.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has already said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is willing to do anything honest she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) can do,''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana</b></font>)</div>answered Diana for me; <div class="bookquote">``and you know, St. John, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) has no choice of helpers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) is forced to put up with such crusty people as you.''
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.
<p/>'' '' Right,'' said Mr. St. John, quite coolly. '' If such is your spirit, I promise to aid you, in my own time and way.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now resumed the book with which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been occupied before tea. I soon withdrew, for I had talked as much, and sat up as long, as my present strength would permit.
<p/>In a few days I had so far recovered my health that I could sit up all day, and walk out sometimes.
<p/>I could join with Diana and Mary in all their occupations; converse with them as much as they wished, and aid them when and where they would allow me.
<p/>There was a reviving pleasure in this intercourse, of a kind now tasted by me for the first time--the pleasure arising from perfect congeniality of tastes, sentiments, and principles.
<p/>CHAPTER XXX The more I knew of the inmates of Moor House, the better I liked them. I liked to read what they liked to read: what they enjoyed, delighted me; what they approved, I reverenced.
<p/>I, too, in the grey, small, antique structure, with its low roof, its latticed casements, its mouldering walls, its avenue of aged firs--all grown aslant under the stress of mountain winds;
<p/>its garden, dark with yew and holly--and where no flowers but of the hardiest species would bloom--found a charm both potent and permanent.
<p/>They clung to the purple moors behind and around their dwelling--to the hollow vale into which the pebbly bridle-path leading from their gate descended, and which wound between fern-banks first, and then amongst a few of the wildest little pasture-fields that ever bordered a wilderness of heath, or gave sustenance to a flock of grey moorland sheep, with their little mossy- faced lambs:--they clung to this scene, I say, with a perfect enthusiasm of attachment.
<p/>They loved their sequestered home. I could comprehend the feeling, and share both its strength and truth. I saw the fascination of the locality.
<p/>I felt the consecration of its loneliness: my eye feasted on the outline of swell and sweep--on the wild colouring communicated to ridge and dell by moss, by heath-bell, by flower-sprinkled turf, by brilliant bracken, and mellow granite crag.
<p/>The strong blast and the soft breeze; the rough and the halcyon day; the hours of sunrise and sunset; the moonlight and the clouded night, developed for me, in these regions, the same attraction as for them--wound round my faculties the same spell that entranced theirs.
<p/>These details were just to me what they were to them--so many pure and sweet sources of pleasure. Indoors we agreed equally well.
<p/>They were both more accomplished and better read than I was; but with eagerness I followed in the path of knowledge they had trodden before me.
<p/>I devoured the books they lent me: then it was full satisfaction to discuss with them in the evening what I had perused during the day.
<p/>Thought fitted thought ; opinion met opinion: we coincided, in short, perfectly. If in our trio there was a superior and a leader, it was Diana.
<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) animal spirits there was an affluence of life and certainty of flow, such as excited my wonder, while it baffled my comprehension.
<p/>Physically, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) far excelled me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was handsome; she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was vigorous. I could talk a while when the evening commenced, but the first gush of vivacity and fluency gone
<p/>, I was fain to sit on a stool at Diana's feet, to rest my head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) knee, and listen alternately to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) and Mary, while they sounded thoroughly the topic on which I had but touched.
<p/>Diana offered to teach me German. I liked to learn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) : I saw the part of instructress pleased and suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>); that of scholar pleased and suited me no less.
<p/>Our natures dovetailed: mutual affection--of the strongest kind--was the result. They discovered I could draw: their pencils and colour-boxes were immediately at my service.
<p/>Mary would sit and watch me by the hour together: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would take lessons; and a docile, intelligent, assiduous pupil she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made.
<p/>My skill, greater in this one point than theirs, surprised and charmed them. Thus occupied, and mutually entertained, days passed like hours, and weeks like days.
<p/>As to Mr. St John, the intimacy which had arisen so naturally and rapidly between me and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sisters did not extend to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>One reason of the distance yet observed between us was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was comparatively seldom at home: a large proportion of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) time appeared devoted to visiting the sick and poor among the scattered population of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) parish.
<p/>No weather seemed to hinder him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in these pastoral excursions: rain or fair, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would, when his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hours of morning study were over, take his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hat, and, followed by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father's old pointer, Carlo, go out on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mission of love or duty
<p/>--I scarcely know in which light he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) regarded it. Sometimes, when the day was very unfavourable, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sisters would expostulate. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would then say, with a peculiar smile, more solemn than cheerful--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I propose to myself?
<p/>But besides his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) frequent absences, there was another barrier to friendship with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed of a reserved, an abstracted, and even of a brooding nature.
<p/>Zealous in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ministerial labours, blameless in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) life and habits, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) yet did not appear to enjoy that mental serenity, that inward content, which should be the reward of every sincere Christian and practical philanthropist.
<p/>Often, of an evening, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) sat at the window, his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) desk and papers before him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would cease reading or writing, rest his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) chin on his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) hand, and deliver himself up to
<p/>I know not what course of thought; but that it was perturbed and exciting might be seen in the frequent flash and changeful dilation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) eye.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>Diana and Mary's general answer to this question was a sigh, and some minutes of apparently mournful meditation. I think, moreover, that Nature was not to him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) that treasury of delight it was to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) sisters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) expressed once, and but once in my hearing, a strong sense of the rugged charm of the hills, and an inborn affection for the dark roof and hoary walls he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) called his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) home; but there was more of gloom than pleasure in the tone and words in which the sentiment was manifested; and never did he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) seem to roam the moors for the sake of their soothing silence--never seek out or dwell upon the thousand peaceful delights they could yield.
<p/>Incommunicative as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was, some time elapsed before I had an opportunity of gauging his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) mind. I first got an idea of its calibre when I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) preach in his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own church at Morton.
<p/>I wish I could describe that sermon: but it is past my power. I cannot even render faithfully the effect it produced on me.
<p/>It began calm--and indeed, as far as delivery and pitch of voice went, it was calm to the end: an earnestly felt, yet strictly restrained zeal breathed soon in the distinct accents, and prompted the nervous language.
<p/>This grew to force--compressed, condensed, controlled. The heart was thrilled, the mind astonished, by the power of the preacher: neither were softened.
<p/>Throughout there was a strange bitterness; an absence of consolatory gentleness; stern allusions to Calvinistic doctrines--election, predestination, reprobation--were frequent; and each reference to these points sounded like a sentence pronounced for doom.
<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) had done, instead of feeling better, calmer, more enlightened by his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) discourse, I experienced an inexpressible sadness; for it seemed to me--
<p/>I know not whether equally so to others--that the eloquence to which I had been listening had sprung from a depth where lay turbid dregs of disappointment--where moved troubling impulses of insatiate yearnings and disquieting aspirations.
<p/>I was sure St. John Rivers--pure-lived, conscientious, zealous as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) was--had not yet found that peace of God which passeth all understanding: he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had no more found it
<p/>, I thought, than had I with my concealed and racking regrets for my broken idol and lost elysium-- regrets to which I have latterly avoided referring, but which possessed me and tyrannised over me ruthlessly.
<p/>Diana and Mary were soon to leave Moor House, and return to the far different life and scene which awaited them, as governesses in a large, fashionable, south-of-England city, where each held a situation in families by whose wealthy and haughty members they were regarded only as humble dependants, and who neither knew nor sought out their innate excellences, and appreciated only their acquired accomplishments as they appreciated the skill of their cook or the taste of their waiting-woman.
<p/>Mr. St. John had said nothing to me yet about the employment he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had promised to obtain for me; yet it became urgent that I should have a vocation of some kind.
<p/>One morning, being left alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a few minutes in the parlour, I ventured to approach the window-recess--which his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) table, chair, and desk consecrated as a kind of study--and I was going to speak, though not very well knowing in what words to frame my inquiry--for it is at all times difficult to break the ice of reserve glassing over such natures as his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) saved me the trouble by being the first to commence a dialogue.
<p/>Meantime a month was gone. Looking up as I drew near--<div class="bookquote">``You have a question to ask of me? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching departure from Marsh End
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer myself to undertake?'' should render yours necessary.''
<p/>'' And they will go in three days now? '' I said. '' Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton:
<p/>I waited a few moments, expecting he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) would go on with the subject first broached: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) seemed to have entered another train of reflection: his (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) look denoted abstraction from me and my business.
<p/>I was obliged to recall him (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) to a theme which was of necessity one of close and anxious interest to me.
<p/>Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up. '' '' What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?
<p/>I hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.'' '' Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept.
<p/>I grew impatient: a restless movement or two, and an eager and exacting glance fastened on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) face, conveyed the feeling to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) as effectually as words could have done, and with less trouble.
<p/>You need be in no hurry to hear,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``let me frankly tell you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.
<p/>Before I explain, recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind man would help the lame.
<p/>I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.
<p/>I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>) native country--not only for life, but in death.
<p/>Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>) shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he (<font color='blue'><b>alien</b></font>) is one, shall give the word, `Rise, follow Me!'
<p/>St. John said these words as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pronounced his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sermons, with a quiet, deep voice; with an unflushed cheek, and a coruscating radiance of glance.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) again paused: there seemed a reluctance to continue. '' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) resumed-- '' And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of poverty and obscurity.
<p/>You may even think it degrading--for I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but I consider that no service degrades which can better our race.
<p/>I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer's task of tillage is appointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)--the scantier the meed his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) toil brings--the higher the honour.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles --their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) looked at me before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) proceeded: indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) seemed leisurely to read my face, as if its features and lines were characters on a page.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Well? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) again paused--<div class="bookquote">``proceed. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The conclusions drawn from this scrutiny he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) partially expressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) succeeding observations.
<p/>I believe you will accept the post I offer you,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and hold it for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Do explain,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I urged, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) halted once more. '' I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how cramping.
<p/>I shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement.
<p/>Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress.
<p/>I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead, and that I am my own master. I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school for girls.
<p/>I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) salary will be thirty pounds a year: her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr.
<p/>The same lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own house and the school as her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) occupation of teaching will prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) having time to discharge in person.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) put the question rather hurriedly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) seemed half to expect an indignant, or at least a disdainful rejection of the offer: not knowing all my thoughts and feelings, though guessing some, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could not tell in what light the lot would appear to me.
<p/>Oliver, the proprietor of a needle- factory and iron-foundry in the valley. Will you be this mistress? '' In truth it was humble--but then it was sheltered, and I wanted a safe asylum
<p/>: it was plodding--but then, compared with that of a governess in a rich house, it was independent; and the fear of servitude with strangers entered my soul like iron: it was not ignoble--not unworthy--not mentally degrading, I made my decision.
<p/>'' I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my heart.'' '' But you comprehend me?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) said. '' It is a village school: your scholars will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers' daughters.
<p/>Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all you will have to teach. What will you do with your accomplishments? What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Save them till they are wanted. They will keep.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You know what you undertake, then?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I do. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) now smiled: and not a bitter or a sad smile, but one well pleased and deeply gratified.
<p/>'' And when will you commence the exercise of your function?'' <div class="bookquote">``I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next week.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well: so be it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) rose and walked through the room. Standing still, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) again looked at me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers? '' I asked. '' You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the maintenance of an even tenor in life.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Why? What is your reason for saying so?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I am not ambitious. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) started at the word <div class="bookquote">``ambitious. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) repeated, <div class="bookquote">``No.
<p/>What made you think of ambition? Who is ambitious? I know I am: but how did you find it out?''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was speaking of myself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Well, if you are not ambitious, you are-- '' He (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) paused. <div class="bookquote">``What?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have misunderstood the word, and been displeased.
<p/>I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus: any more than I can be content,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>tenor</b></font>) added, with emphasis, <div class="bookquote">``to live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.
<p/>I mean, that human affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you. You hear now how I contradict myself.
<p/>I, who preached contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers of water in God's service--I, His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) ordained minister, almost rave in my restlessness.
<p/>In this brief hour I had learnt more of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) than in the whole previous month: yet still he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) puzzled me.
<p/>Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by some means. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) left the room. Diana and Mary Rivers became more sad and silent as the day approached for leaving their brother and their home.
<p/>They both tried to appear as usual; but the sorrow they had to struggle against was one that could not be entirely conquered or concealed.
<p/>It would probably, as far as St. John was concerned, be a parting for years: it might be a parting for life.
<p/>Diana intimated that this would be a different parting from any they had ever yet known. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will sacrifice all to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) long-framed resolves,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``natural affection and feelings more potent still.
<p/>You would think him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gentle, yet in some things he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) for it.
<p/>St. John looks quiet, Jane; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hides a fever in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) vitals. It is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>And the tears gushed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) fine eyes. Mary bent her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head low over her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) work. '' We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) murmured.
<p/>At that moment a little accident supervened, which seemed decreed by fate purposely to prove the truth of the adage, that <div class="bookquote">``misfortunes never come singly,''  (<font color='red'><b>the lip</b></font>)</div>and to add to their distresses the vexing one of the slip between the cup and the lip.
<p/>St. John passed the window reading a letter. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entered. '' Our uncle John is dead,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). Both the sisters seemed struck: not shocked or appalled; the tidings appeared in their eyes rather momentous than afflicting.
<p/>'' Dead? '' repeated Diana. '' Yes. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) riveted a searching gaze on her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) brother's face. '' And what then?'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) demanded, in a low voice.
<p/>'' What then, Die? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) replied, maintaining a marble immobility of feature. '' What then? Why--nothing. Read. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) threw the letter into her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) lap.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) glanced over it, and handed it to Mary. Mary perused it in silence, and returned it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother. All three looked at each other, and all three smiled--a dreary, pensive smile enough.
<p/>'' Amen! We can yet live,'' said Diana at last. '' At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,'' remarked Mary.
<p/>Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what might have been ,'' said Mr. Rivers, <div class="bookquote">``and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with what is .
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rivers/Rivers</b></font>)</div>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) folded the letter, locked it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) desk, and again went out. For some minutes no one spoke.
<p/>Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and think us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) or known him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).
<p/>Diana then turned to me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was my mother's brother. My father and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) quarrelled long ago. It was by his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) advice that my father risked most of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) property in the speculation that ruined him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).
<p/>Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and were never reconciled. My uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) realised a fortune of twenty thousand pounds.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was never married, and had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.
<p/>My father always cherished the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would atone for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) error by leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) possessions to us; that letter informs us that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had a right, of course, to do as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news.
<p/>Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it would have enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to do.
<p/>This explanation given, the subject was dropped, and no further reference made to it by either Mr. Rivers or his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) sisters.
<p/>'' The next day I left Marsh End for Morton. The day after, Diana and Mary quitted it for distant B-.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXI My home, then, when I at last find a home,--is a cottage; a little room with whitewashed walls and a sanded floor, containing four painted chairs and a table, a clock, a cupboard, with two or three plates and dishes, and a set of tea-things in delf.
<p/>Above, a chamber of the same dimensions as the kitchen, with a deal bedstead and chest of drawers; small, yet too large to be filled with my scanty wardrobe: though the kindness of my gentle and generous friends has increased that, by a modest stock of such things as are necessary.
<p/>In a week, Mr. Rivers and Hannah repaired to the parsonage: and so the old grange was abandoned. It is evening.
<p/>I have dismissed, with the fee of an orange, the little orphan who serves me as a handmaid. I am sitting alone on the hearth.
<p/>This morning, the village school opened. I had twenty scholars. But three of the number can read: none write or cipher.
<p/>Several knit, and a few sew a little. They speak with the broadest accent of the district. At present, they and I have a difficulty in understanding each other's language.
<p/>Some of them are unmannered, rough, intractable, as well as ignorant; but others are docile, have a wish to learn, and evince a disposition that pleases me.
<p/>I must not forget that these coarsely-clad little peasants are of flesh and blood as good as the scions of gentlest genealogy; and that the germs of native excellence, refinement, intelligence, kind feeling, are as likely to exist in their hearts as in those of the best-born.
<p/>Much enjoyment I do not expect in the life opening before me: yet it will, doubtless, if I regulate my mind, and exert my powers as I ought, yield me enough to live on from day to day.
<p/>My duty will be to develop these germs: surely I shall find some happiness in discharging that office. Was I very gleeful, settled, content, during the hours I passed in yonder bare, humble schoolroom this morning and afternoon?
<p/>Not to deceive myself, I must reply-- No: I felt desolate to a degree. I felt--yes, idiot that I am--I felt degraded.
<p/>I doubted I had taken a step which sank instead of raising me in the scale of social existence. I was weakly dismayed at the ignorance, the poverty, the coarseness of all I heard and saw round me.
<p/>But let me not hate and despise myself too much for these feelings; I know them to be wrong--that is a great step gained; I shall strive to overcome them.
<p/>To-morrow, I trust, I shall get the better of them partially; and in a few weeks, perhaps, they will be quite subdued.
<p/>In a few months, it is possible, the happiness of seeing progress, and a change for the better in my scholars may substitute gratification for disgust.
<p/>Which is better?--To have surrendered to temptation; listened to passion; made no painful effort--no struggle;--but to have sunk down in the silken snare; fallen asleep on the flowers covering it; wakened in a southern clime, amongst the luxuries of a pleasure villa: to have been now living in France, Mr. Rochester's mistress; delirious with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) love half my time--for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would--oh, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would have loved me well for a while.
<p/>I shall never more know the sweet homage given to beauty, youth, and grace--for never to any one else shall I seem to possess these charms.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was fond and proud of me--it is what no man besides will ever be.--But where am I wandering, and what am I saying, and above all, feeling?
<p/>Whether is it better, I ask, to be a slave in a fool's paradise at Marseilles--fevered with delusive bliss one hour--suffocating with the bitterest tears of remorse and shame the next--or to be a village-schoolmistress, free and honest, in a breezy mountain nook in the healthy heart of England?
<p/>Yes; I feel now that I was right when I adhered to principle and law, and scorned and crushed the insane promptings of a frenzied moment.
<p/>Meantime, let me ask myself one question-- He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) did love me--no one will ever love me so again. God directed me to a correct choice: I thank His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) providence for the guidance!
<p/>Having brought my eventide musings to this point, I rose, went to my door, and looked at the sunset of the harvest-day, and at the quiet fields before my cottage, which, with the school, was distant half a mile from the village.
<p/>The birds were singing their last strains-- <div class="bookquote">``The air was mild, the dew was balm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>While I looked, I thought myself happy, and was surprised to find myself ere long weeping--and why?
<p/>For the doom which had reft me from adhesion to my master: for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) I was no more to see; for the desperate grief and fatal fury--consequences of my departure--which might now, perhaps, be dragging him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) from the path of right, too far to leave hope of ultimate restoration thither.
<p/>At this thought, I turned my face aside from the lovely sky of eve and lonely vale of Morton--I say lonely , for in that bend of it visible to me there was no building apparent save the church and the parsonage, half-hid in trees, and, quite at the extremity, the roof of Vale Hall, where the rich Mr. Oliver and his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) daughter lived.
<p/>I hid my eyes, and leant my head against the stone frame of my door; but soon a slight noise near the wicket which shut in my tiny garden from the meadow beyond it made me look up.
<p/>A dog--old Carlo, Mr. Rivers' pointer, as I saw in a moment--was pushing the gate with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) nose, and St. John himself leant upon it with folded arms; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brow knit, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gaze, grave almost to displeasure, fixed on me.
<p/>I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to come in. '' No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters left for you.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) examined my face, I thought, with austerity, as I came near: the traces of tears were doubtless very visible upon it.
<p/>I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper. '' I approached to take it: a welcome gift it was. ''
<p/>Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked. '' Oh, no! On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my scholars very well.''
<p/>'' But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have disappointed your expectations? They are, in truth, scanty enough; but-- '' I interrupted-- ''
<p/>I am not absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a business.
<p/>My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and commodious. All I see has made me thankful, not despondent. I wonder at the goodness of God;
<p/>the generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot. I do not repine. '' '' But you feel solitude an oppression?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow impatient under one of loneliness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears of Lot's wife.
<p/>What you had left before I saw you, of course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career steadily, for some months at least.''
<p/>The little house there behind you is dark and empty. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``It is what I mean to do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.
<p/>God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.
<p/>St. John continued-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had made a mistake in entering the ministry
<p/>I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.
<p/>: its uniform duties wearied me to death. I considered; my life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.
<p/>my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread their wings, and mount beyond ken.
<p/>God had an errand for me; to bear which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.
<p/>From that moment my state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.
<p/>My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) death, I have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I will overcome--and I leave Europe for the East.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) said this, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) peculiar, subdued, yet emphatic voice; looking, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) had ceased speaking, not at me, but at the setting sun, at which I looked too.
<p/>After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: '' A missionary I resolved to be. '' Both he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) and I had our backs towards the path leading up the field to the wicket.
<p/>We had heard no step on that grass-grown track; the water running in the vale was the one lulling sound of the hour and scene; we might well then start when a gay voice, sweet as a silver bell, exclaimed-- <div class="bookquote">``Good evening, Mr. Rivers.
<p/>Your dog is quicker to recognise his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) friends than you are, sir; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) pricked his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) ears and wagged his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have your back towards me now.
<p/>Though Mr. Rivers had started at the first of those musical accents, as if a thunderbolt had split a cloud over his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) stood yet, at the close of the sentence, in the same attitude in which the speaker had surprised him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>)--his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) arm resting on the gate, his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) face directed towards the west.
<p/>And good evening, old Carlo. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) turned at last, with measured deliberation. A vision, as it seemed to me, had risen at his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) side.
<p/>There appeared, within three feet of him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>), a form clad in pure white--a youthful, graceful form: full, yet fine in contour; and when, after bending to caress Carlo, it lifted up its head, and threw back a long veil, there bloomed under his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) glance a face of perfect beauty.
<p/>Perfect beauty is a strong expression; but I do not retrace or qualify it: as sweet features as ever the temperate clime of Albion moulded; as pure hues of rose and lily as ever her (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) humid gales and vapoury skies generated and screened, justified, in this instance, the term.
<p/>No charm was wanting, no defect was perceptible; the young girl had regular and delicate lineaments; eyes shaped and coloured as we see them in lovely pictures, large, and dark, and full; the long and shadowy eyelash which encircles a fine eye with so soft a fascination; the pencilled brow which gives such clearness; the white smooth forehead, which adds such repose to the livelier beauties of tint and ray; the cheek oval, fresh, and smooth; the lips, fresh too, ruddy, healthy, sweetly formed; the even and gleaming teeth without flaw; the small dimpled chin; the ornament of rich, plenteous tresses--all advantages, in short, which, combined, realise the ideal of beauty, were fully hers.
<p/>Nature had surely formed her in a partial mood; and, forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) usual stinted step-mother dole of gifts, had endowed this, her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) darling, with a grand-dame's bounty.
<p/>I wondered, as I looked at this fair creature: I admired her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) with my whole heart. What did St. John Rivers think of this earthly angel?
<p/>I naturally asked myself that question as I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) turn to her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) and look at her (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>); and, as naturally, I sought the answer to the inquiry in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) countenance.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) had already withdrawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) eye from the Peri, and was looking at a humble tuft of daisies which grew by the wicket.
<p/>A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) crushed the snowy heads of the closed flowers with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) foot.
<p/>'' '' Oh, I only came home from S- '' -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>her</b></font>) mentioned the name of a large town some twenty miles distant-RRB- <div class="bookquote">``this afternoon.
<p/>Papa told me you had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)
<p/>: this is she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>pointing to me. '' It is,'' said St. John. '' Do you think you shall like Morton?
<p/>'' she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) asked of me, with a direct and naive simplicity of tone and manner, pleasing, if child-like. '' I hope I shall.
<p/>I have many inducements to do so. '' <div class="bookquote">``Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Quite. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Do you like your house?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very much.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Have I furnished it nicely?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Very nicely, indeed.''  (<font color='red'><b>an attendant</b></font>)</div>'' And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?''
<p/>-LRB-This then, I thought, is Miss Oliver, the heiress; favoured, it seems, in the gifts of fortune, as well as in those of nature!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You have indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is teachable and handy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>What happy combination of the planets presided over her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) birth, I wonder?-RRB-
<p/>'' I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) added. '' It will be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.
<p/>Mr. Rivers, I have been so gay during my stay at S-. Last night, or rather this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.
<p/>The --th regiment are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) mouth certainly looked a good deal compressed, and the lower part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) face unusually stern and square, as the laughing girl gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) this information.
<p/>'' It seemed to me that Mr. St. John's under lip protruded, and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) upper lip curled a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gaze, too, from the daisies, and turned it on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>An unsmiling, a searching, a meaning gaze it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) answered it with a second laugh, and laughter well became her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) youth, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) roses, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) dimples, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bright eyes.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stood, mute and grave, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) again fell to caressing Carlo. '' Poor Carlo loves me,'' said she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) is not stern and distant to his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) friends; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) could speak, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) would not be silent.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) patted the dog's head, bending with native grace before his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) young and austere master, I saw a glow rise to that master's face.
<p/>'' I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) solemn eye melt with sudden fire, and flicker with resistless emotion. Flushed and kindled thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) looked nearly as beautiful for a man as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) for a woman.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) chest heaved once, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) large heart, weary of despotic constriction, had expanded, despite the will, and made a vigorous bound for the attainment of liberty.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) curbed it, I think, as a resolute rider would curb a rearing steed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>) responded neither by word nor movement to the gentle advances made him (<font color='blue'><b>Carlo</b></font>). ''
<p/>Papa says you never come to see us now,'' continued Miss Oliver, looking up. '' You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) is alone this evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)?'' <div class="bookquote">``It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>answered St. John.
<p/>It is just the hour when papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) has no business to occupy him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>).
<p/>'' Not a seasonable hour! But I declare it is. Now, Mr. Rivers, do come. Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) filled up the hiatus his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) silence left by a reply of her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) own. '' I forgot! '' she (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) exclaimed, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) beautiful curled head, as if shocked at herself.
<p/>'' I am so giddy and thoughtless! Do excuse me. It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter.
<p/>Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely. I am sure I pity you.
<p/>Do come and see papa. '' <div class="bookquote">``Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night. ''  (<font color='red'><b>St. John/Mr. St. John/Mr. John</b></font>)</div>Mr. St. John spoke almost like an automaton: himself only knew the effort it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thus to refuse.
<p/>Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any longer: the dew begins to fall.
<p/>'' Good evening! '' She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) hand. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) just touched it. '' Good evening! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) repeated, in a voice low and hollow as an echo.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) turned, but in a moment returned. '' Are you well? '' she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) asked. Well might she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) put the question: his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) face was blanched as her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) gown.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) turned twice to gaze after him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) tripped fairy-like down the field; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) strode firmly across, never turned at all.
<p/>'' Quite well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) enunciated; and, with a bow, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) left the gate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) went one way; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) another. This spectacle of another's suffering and sacrifice rapt my thoughts from exclusive meditation on my own.
<p/>Diana Rivers had designated her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) brother <div class="bookquote">``inexorable as death. ''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had not exaggerated. CHAPTER XXXII I continued the labours of the village-school as actively and faithfully as I could.
<p/>It was truly hard work at first. Some time elapsed before, with all my efforts, I could comprehend my scholars and their nature.
<p/>Wholly untaught, with faculties quite torpid, they seemed to me hopelessly dull; and, at first sight, all dull alike: but I soon found I was mistaken.
<p/>There was a difference amongst them as amongst the educated; and when I got to know them, and they me, this difference rapidly developed itself.
<p/>Their amazement at me, my language, my rules, and ways, once subsided, I found some of these heavy-looking, gaping rustics wake up into sharp-witted girls enough.
<p/>Many showed themselves obliging, and amiable too; and I discovered amongst them not a few examples of natural politeness, and innate self-respect, as well as of excellent capacity, that won both my goodwill and my admiration.
<p/>These soon took a pleasure in doing their work well, in keeping their persons neat, in learning their tasks regularly, in acquiring quiet and orderly manners.
<p/>The rapidity of their progress, in some instances, was even surprising; and an honest and happy pride I took in it: besides, I began personally to like some of the best girls; and they liked me.
<p/>These could already read, write, and sew; and to them I taught the elements of grammar, geography, history, and the finer kinds of needlework.
<p/>I found estimable characters amongst them--characters desirous of information and disposed for improvement--with whom I passed many a pleasant evening hour in their own homes.
<p/>I had amongst my scholars several farmers' daughters: young women grown, almost. Their parents then -LRB-the farmer and his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) wife-RRB- loaded me with attentions.
<p/>There was an enjoyment in accepting their simple kindness, and in repaying it by a consideration--a scrupulous regard to their feelings--to which they were not, perhaps, at all times accustomed, and which both charmed and benefited them; because, while it elevated them in their own eyes, it made them emulous to merit the deferential treatment they received.
<p/>I felt I became a favourite in the neighbourhood. Whenever I went out, I heard on all sides cordial salutations, and was welcomed with friendly smiles.
<p/>To live amidst general regard, though it be but the regard of working people, is like <div class="bookquote">``sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;''  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>serene inward feelings bud and bloom under the ray.
<p/>At this period of my life, my heart far oftener swelled with thankfulness than sank with dejection: and yet, reader, to tell you all, in the midst of this calm, this useful existence--after a day passed in honourable exertion amongst my scholars, an evening spent in drawing or reading contentedly alone--I used to rush into strange dreams at night: dreams many-coloured, agitated, full of the ideal, the stirring, the stormy--
<p/>, I still again and again met Mr. Rochester, always at some exciting crisis; and then the sense of being in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arms, hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) voice, meeting his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eye, touching his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hand and cheek, loving him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), being loved by him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)--the hope of passing a lifetime at his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) side, would be renewed, with all its first force and fire.
<p/>dreams where, amidst unusual scenes, charged with adventure, with agitating risk and romantic chance Then I awoke. Then I recalled where I was, and how situated.
<p/>Then I rose up on my curtainless bed, trembling and quivering; and then the still, dark night witnessed the convulsion of despair, and heard the burst of passion.
<p/>By nine o'clock the next morning I was punctually opening the school; tranquil, settled, prepared for the steady duties of the day.
<p/>Rosamond Oliver kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) word in coming to visit me. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) call at the school was generally made in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) morning ride.
<p/>Anything more exquisite than her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) appearance, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) purple habit, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) Amazon's cap of black velvet placed gracefully above the long curls that kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) cheek and floated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) shoulders, can scarcely be imagined: and it was thus she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would enter the rustic building, and glide through the dazzled ranks of the village children.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) would canter up to the door on her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pony, followed by a mounted livery servant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) generally came at the hour when Mr. Rivers was engaged in giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) daily catechising lesson.
<p/>A sort of instinct seemed to warn him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) entrance, even when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) did not see it; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) was looking quite away from the door, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) appeared at it, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) cheek would glow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) marble-seeming features, though they refused to relax, changed indescribably, and in their very quiescence became expressive of a repressed fervour, stronger than working muscle or darting glance could indicate.
<p/>Keenly, I fear, did the eye of the visitress pierce the young pastor's heart. Of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) power: indeed, he (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) did not, because he (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) could not, conceal it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>).
<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) Christian stoicism, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) went up and addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>), and smiled gaily, encouragingly, even fondly in his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) face, his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) hand would tremble and his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) eye burn.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) seemed to say, with his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) sad and resolute look, if he (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) did not say it with his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) lips, <div class="bookquote">``I love you, and I know you prefer me.
<p/>It is not despair of success that keeps me dumb. If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.
<p/>But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.
<p/>And then she (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) would pout like a disappointed child; a pensive cloud would soften her (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) radiant vivacity; she (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) would withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) hand hastily from his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>), and turn in transient petulance from his (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) aspect, at once so heroic and so martyr-like.
<p/>St. John, no doubt, would have given the world to follow, recall, retain her (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) thus left him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would not give one chance of heaven, nor relinquish, for the elysium of her (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) love, one hope of the true, eternal Paradise.
<p/>Besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could not bind all that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nature--the rover, the aspirant, the poet, the priest--in the limits of a single passion.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could not--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would not--renounce his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wild field of mission warfare for the parlours and the peace of Vale Hall.
<p/>I learnt so much from himself in an inroad I once, despite his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) reserve, had the daring to make on his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) confidence.
<p/>I had learnt her (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) whole character, which was without mystery or disguise: she (<font color='blue'><b>pastor</b></font>) was coquettish but not heartless; exacting, but not worthlessly selfish.
<p/>Miss Oliver already honoured me with frequent visits to my cottage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had been indulged from her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) birth, but was not absolutely spoilt.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was hasty, but good-humoured; vain -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) could not help it, when every glance in the glass showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) such a flush of loveliness-RRB-, but not affected; liberal-handed; innocent of the pride of wealth; ingenuous; sufficiently intelligent; gay, lively, and unthinking: she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was very charming, in short, even to a cool observer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) own sex like me; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was not profoundly interesting or thoroughly impressive.
<p/>Still, I liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) almost as I liked my pupil Adele; except that, for a child whom we have watched over and taught, a closer affection is engendered than we can give an equally attractive adult acquaintance.
<p/>A very different sort of mind was hers from that, for instance, of the sisters of St. John. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) had taken an amiable caprice to me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said I was like Mr. Rivers, only, certainly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) allowed, <div class="bookquote">``not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) was an angel.
<p/>I was a lusus naturae , she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) affirmed, as a village schoolmistress: she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was sure my previous history, if known, would make a delightful romance.
<p/>One evening, while, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) usual child-like activity, and thoughtless yet not offensive inquisitiveness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) was rummaging the cupboard and the table-drawer of my little kitchen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) discovered first two French books, a volume of Schiller, a German grammar and dictionary, and then my drawing-materials and some sketches, including a pencil-head of a pretty little cherub-like girl, one of my scholars, and sundry views from nature, taken in the Vale of Morton and on the surrounding moors.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I was, however, good, clever, composed, and firm, like him (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was first transfixed with surprise, and then electrified with delight.
<p/>'' Had I done these pictures? Did I know French and German? What a love--what a miracle I was! I drew better than her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) master in the first school in S-.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``With pleasure,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I replied; and I felt a thrill of artist-delight at the idea of copying from so perfect and radiant a model.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had then on a dark-blue silk dress; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) arms and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) neck were bare; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) only ornament was her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) chestnut tresses, which waved over her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) shoulders with all the wild grace of natural curls.
<p/>Would I sketch a portrait of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), to show to papa?'' I took a sheet of fine card-board, and drew a careful outline.
<p/>I promised myself the pleasure of colouring it; and, as it was getting late then, I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must come and sit another day.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) made such a report of me to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father, that Mr. Oliver himself accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) next evening--a tall, massive-featured, middle-aged, and grey-headed man, at whose side his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lovely daughter looked like a bright flower near a hoary turret.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared a taciturn, and perhaps a proud personage; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very kind to me. The sketch of Rosamond's portrait pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) highly: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said I must make a finished picture of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) insisted, too, on my coming the next day to spend the evening at Vale Hall. I went. I found it a large, handsome residence, showing abundant evidences of wealth in the proprietor.
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father was affable; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entered into conversation with me after tea, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expressed in strong terms his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) approbation of what I had done in Morton school, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) only feared, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) saw and heard, I was too good for the place, and would soon quit it for one more suitable.
<p/>Rosamond was full of glee and pleasure all the time I stayed. '' Indeed,'' cried Rosamond, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) is clever enough to be a governess in a high family, papa.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Rosamond/Rosamond Oliver</b></font>)</div>I thought I would far rather be where I am than in any high family in the land. Mr. Oliver spoke of Mr. Rivers--of the Rivers family--with great respect.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said it was a very old name in that neighbourhood; that the ancestors of the house were wealthy; that all Morton had once belonged to them; that even now he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) considered the representative of that house might, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) liked, make an alliance with the best.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) accounted it a pity that so fine and talented a young man should have formed the design of going out as a missionary; it was quite throwing a valuable life away.
<p/>Mr. Oliver evidently regarded the young clergyman's good birth, old name, and sacred profession as sufficient compensation for the want of fortune.
<p/>It appeared, then, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) father would throw no obstacle in the way of Rosamond's union with St. John. It was the 5th of November, and a holiday.
<p/>My little servant, after helping me to clean my house, was gone, well satisfied with the fee of a penny for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) aid.
<p/>All about me was spotless and bright--scoured floor, polished grate, and well-rubbed chairs. I had also made myself neat, and had now the afternoon before me to spend as I would.
<p/>The translation of a few pages of German occupied an hour; then I got my palette and pencils, and fell to the more soothing, because easier occupation, of completing Rosamond Oliver's miniature.
<p/>The head was finished already: there was but the background to tint and the drapery to shade off; a touch of carmine, too, to add to the ripe lips--a soft curl here and there to the tresses--a deeper tinge to the shadow of the lash under the azured eyelid.
<p/>I was absorbed in the execution of these nice details, when, after one rapid tap, my door unclosed, admitting St. John Rivers.
<p/>'' I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) said. '' Not, I hope, in thought? No, that is well
<p/>: while you draw you will not feel lonely. You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up wonderfully so far.
<p/>I have brought you a book for evening solace,'' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) laid on the table a new publication--a poem: one of those genuine productions so often vouchsafed to the fortunate public of those days--the golden age of modern literature.
<p/>I know poetry is not dead, nor genius lost; nor has Mammon gained power over either, to bind or slay: they will both assert their existence, their presence, their liberty and strength again one day.
<p/>Alas! the readers of our era are less favoured. But courage! I will not pause either to accuse or repine. Powerful angels, safe in heaven!
<p/>they smile when sordid souls triumph, and feeble ones weep over their destruction. Poetry destroyed? Genius banished? No! Mediocrity, no: do not let envy prompt you to the thought.
<p/>No; they not only live, but reign and redeem: and without their divine influence spread everywhere, you would be in hell--the hell of your own meanness.
<p/>While I was eagerly glancing at the bright pages of <div class="bookquote">``Marmion''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-for <div class="bookquote">``Marmion''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>it was-RRB-, St. John stooped to examine my drawing.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tall figure sprang erect again with a start: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said nothing. I looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shunned my eye.
<p/>I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thoughts well, and could read his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart plainly; at the moment I felt calmer and cooler than he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>):
<p/>I had then temporarily the advantage of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and I conceived an inclination to do him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) some good, if I could.
<p/>'' With all his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) firmness and self-control,'' thought I, <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) tasks himself too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses, imparts nothing.
<p/>I am sure it would benefit him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to talk a little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) thinks he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ought not to marry: I will make him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) talk.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said first, <div class="bookquote">``Take a chair, Mr. Rivers. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) answered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) always did, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) could not stay.
<p/>'' Very well,'' I responded, mentally, <div class="bookquote">``stand if you like; but you shall not go just yet , I am determined: solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me.
<p/>I'll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Is this portrait like? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I asked bluntly. '' Like! Like whom? I did not observe it closely. '' '' You did, Mr. Rivers.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) almost started at my sudden and strange abruptness: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) looked at me astonished. '' Oh, that is nothing yet,'' I muttered within.
<p/>'' I don't mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to considerable lengths.
<p/>I continued, <div class="bookquote">``You observed it closely and distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I rose and placed it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) hand.
<p/>'' '' A well-executed picture,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``very soft, clear colouring; very graceful and correct drawing. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes, yes; I know all that.
<p/>And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.
<p/>But what of the resemblance? Who is it like?''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mastering some hesitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``Miss Oliver, I presume.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Of course. I don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would deem worthless.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) continued to gaze at the picture: the longer he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) looked, the firmer he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) held it, the more he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) seemed to covet it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' It is like!'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) murmured; <div class="bookquote">``the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect. It smiles!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?
<p/>When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession?
<p/>Tell me that. or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress? ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) now furtively raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) eyes: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) glanced at me, irresolute, disturbed: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) again surveyed the picture.
<p/>'' That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious or wise is another question. ''
<p/>Since I had ascertained that Rosamond really preferred him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>), and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Rosamond</b></font>) father was not likely to oppose the match, I--less exalted in my views than St. John--had been strongly disposed in my own heart to advocate their union.
<p/>It seemed to me that, should he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) become the possessor of Mr. Oliver's large fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might do as much good with it as if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) went and laid his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) genius out to wither, and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) strength to waste, under a tropical sun.
<p/>With this persuasion I now answered-- <div class="bookquote">``As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to take to yourself the original at once.
<p/>By this time he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had sat down: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had laid the picture on the table before him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brow supported on both hands, hung fondly over it.
<p/>I saw even that to be thus frankly addressed on a subject he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had deemed unapproachable--to hear it thus freely handled--was beginning to be felt by him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as a new pleasure--an unhoped-for relief.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I discerned he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was now neither angry nor shocked at my audacity. Reserved people often really need the frank discussion of their sentiments and griefs more than the expansive.
<p/>The sternest-seeming stoic is human after all; and to <div class="bookquote">``burst''  (<font color='red'><b>souls</b></font>)</div>with boldness and good-will into <div class="bookquote">``the silent sea''  (<font color='red'><b>souls</b></font>)</div>of their souls is often to confer on them the first of obligations.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) likes you, I am sure,'' said I, as I stood behind his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chair, <div class="bookquote">``and her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) father respects you.

<p/>Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying plans.
<p/>And now it is deluged with a nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is talking to me with her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes
<p/>your skilful hand has copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips. She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) is mine--I am hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.

<p/>You might relinquish that scheme. '' ``Relinquish! What! my vocation? My great work? My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven?
<p/>My hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope of heaven for the fear of hell?
<p/>Must I relinquish that? It is dearer than the blood in my veins. It is what I have to look forward to, and to live for.

(<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) will forget me; and will marry, probably, some one who will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) far happier than I should do.''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom.

<p/>I could never rest in communication with strong, discreet, and refined minds, whether male or female, till I had passed the outworks of conventional reserve, and crossed the threshold of confidence, and won a place by their heart's very hearthstone.

<p/>That is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea. Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I smiled incredulously. '' You have taken my confidence by storm,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">``and now it is much at your service.

<p/>I honour endurance, perseverance, industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence.
<p/>I watch your career with interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you still suffer.
<p/>Natural affection only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over me. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said.
<p/>'' No. There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I believe; and I believe the Gospel. You missed your epithet.
<p/>I am not a pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus. As His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) disciple I adopt His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) pure, His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) merciful, His (<font color='blue'><b>Jesus</b></font>) benignant doctrines.
<p/>I advocate them: I am sworn to spread them. Won in youth to religion, she (<font color='blue'><b>philosophers</b></font>) has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From
<p/>the minute germ, natural affection, she (<font color='blue'><b>philosophers</b></font>) has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy. From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she (<font color='blue'><b>philosophers</b></font>) has reared a due sense of the Divine justice.
<p/>Of the ambition to win power and renown for my wretched self, she (<font color='blue'><b>philosophers</b></font>) has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.
<p/>So much has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning and training nature. But she (<font color='blue'><b>philosophers</b></font>) could not eradicate nature: nor will it be eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'
<p/>'' Having said this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) hat, which lay on the table beside my palette. Once more he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) looked at the portrait.
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>philosophers</b></font>) is lovely,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) murmured. '' She (<font color='blue'><b>philosophers</b></font>) is well named the Rose of the World, indeed!'' '' And may I not paint one like it for you?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) drew over the picture the sheet of thin paper on which I was accustomed to rest my hand in painting, to prevent the cardboard from being sullied.
<p/>What he (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) suddenly saw on this blank paper, it was impossible for me to tell; but something had caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) eye.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) took it up with a snatch; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) looked at the edge; then shot a glance at me, inexpressibly peculiar, and quite incomprehensible: a glance that seemed to take and make note of every point in my shape, face, and dress; for it traversed all, quick, keen as lightning.
<p/>'' Cui bono ? No. '' His (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) lips parted, as if to speak: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) checked the coming sentence, whatever it was.
<p/>Nothing in the world,'' was the reply; and, replacing the paper, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) dexterously tear a narrow slip from the margin.
<p/>'' What is the matter? '' I asked. '' It disappeared in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) glove; and, with one hasty nod and <div class="bookquote">``good-afternoon,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rose</b></font>) vanished.
<p/>I, in my turn, scrutinised the paper; but saw nothing on it save a few dingy stains of paint where I had tried the tint in my pencil.
<p/>I pondered the mystery a minute or two; but finding it insolvable, and being certain it could not be of much moment, I dismissed, and soon forgot it.
<p/>'' Well!'' I exclaimed, using an expression of the district, <div class="bookquote">``that caps the globe, however!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER XXXIII When Mr. St. John went, it was beginning to snow; the whirling storm continued all night.
<p/>The next day a keen wind brought fresh and blinding falls; by twilight the valley was drifted up and almost impassable.
<p/>I had closed my shutter, laid a mat to the door to prevent the snow from blowing in under it, trimmed my fire, and after sitting nearly an hour on the hearth listening to the muffled fury of the tempest, I lit a candle, took down <div class="bookquote">``Marmion,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and beginning-- <div class="bookquote">``Day set on Norham's castled steep, And Tweed's fair river broad and deep, And Cheviot's mountains lone; The massive towers, the donjon keep, The flanking walls that round them sweep,
<p/>In yellow lustre shone'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-- I soon forgot storm in music. I heard a noise: the wind, I thought, shook the door.
<p/>No; it was St. John Rivers, who, lifting the latch, came in out of the frozen hurricane--the howling darkness--and stood before me: the cloak that covered his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) tall figure all white as a glacier.
<p/>I was almost in consternation, so little had I expected any guest from the blocked-up vale that night. '' Any ill news?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) answered, removing his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) cloak and hanging it up against the door, towards which he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) again coolly pushed the mat which his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) entrance had deranged.
<p/>'' I demanded. '' Has anything happened?'' '' No. How very easily alarmed you are! He (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) stamped the snow from his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) boots.
<p/>'' I shall sully the purity of your floor,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``but you must excuse me for once. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) approached the fire.
<p/>I have had hard work to get here, I assure you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) observed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) hands over the flame.
<p/>'' '' One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet. '' '' But why are you come?
<p/>Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you
<p/>Besides, since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is impatient to hear the sequel.
<p/>'' I could not forbear saying. '' ; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sat down.
<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) were insane, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was a very cool and collected insanity: I had never seen that handsome-featured face of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) look more like chiselled marble than it did just now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) put aside his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) snow-wet hair from his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) forehead and let the firelight shine free on his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) pale brow and cheek as pale, where it grieved me to discover the hollow trace of care or sorrow now so plainly graved.
<p/>I waited, expecting he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) would say something I could at least comprehend; but his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) hand was now at his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) chin, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) finger on his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) lip: he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was thinking.
<p/>I recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) singular conduct of yesterday, and really I began to fear his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) wits were touched. It struck me that his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) hand looked wasted like his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) face.
<p/>A perhaps uncalled-for gush of pity came over my heart: I was moved to say-- <div class="bookquote">``I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you
<p/>: it is too bad that you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own health. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Not at all,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">``I care for myself when necessary. I am well now. What do you see amiss in me?
<p/>This was said with a careless, abstracted indifference, which showed that my solicitude was, at least in his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) opinion, wholly superfluous.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) still slowly moved his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) finger over his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) upper lip, and still his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) eye dwelt dreamily on the glowing grate; thinking it urgent to say something, I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) presently if he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt any cold draught from the door, which was behind him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>).
<p/>Well,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I reflected, <div class="bookquote">``if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you alone now, and return to my book.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was silenced. '' No, no! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) responded shortly and somewhat testily. '' '' So I snuffed the candle and resumed the perusal of <div class="bookquote">``Marmion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) soon stirred; my eye was instantly drawn to his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) movements; he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) only took out a morocco pocket-book, thence produced a letter, which he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) read in silence, folded it, put it back, relapsed into meditation.
<p/>It was vain to try to read with such an inscrutable fixture before me; nor could I, in impatience, consent to be dumb; he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) might rebuff me if he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) liked, but talk I would.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?'' '' Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Baffled so far, I changed my ground. I bethought myself to talk about the school and my scholars.
<p/>Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Indeed!''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Oliver/Oliver</b></font>)</div>'' Mr. Oliver pays for two.'' <div class="bookquote">``Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>)?''

<p/><div class="bookquote">``I know. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Was it your suggestion?''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Again came the blank of a pause: the clock struck eight strokes. It aroused him (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) uncrossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) legs, sat erect, turned to me.
<p/>'' Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) said. Wondering, and of my wonder finding no end, I complied.
<p/>Half-an-hour ago,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``I spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener.
<p/>Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips.
<p/>Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) name at this moment--fell in love with a rich man's daughter; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fell in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>), and married him (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>), against the advice of all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) friends, who consequently disowned her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) immediately after the wedding.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short. '' Before two years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab.

<p/>They left a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night.
<p/>Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in- law, called -LRB-I come to names now-RRB-
<p/>I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To proceed.
<p/>Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>), I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of that time she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) transferred it to a place you know--being no other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.
<p/>It seems her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) became a teacher, like yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) history and yours--she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were analogous; she (<font color='blue'><b>Reed</b></font>) undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester.
<p/>I can guess your feelings,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``but restrain them for a while: I have nearly finished; hear me to the end.
<p/>Of Mr. Rochester's character I know nothing, but the one fact that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) discovered he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.
<p/>What his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was discovered she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) course had been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of information could be gathered respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>).
<p/>Yet that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should be found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``Just tell me this,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, ``and since you know so much, you surely can tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to.

(<font color='red'><b>the governess</b></font>)</div>You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event which requires her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) appearance.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then? Did no one see Mr. Rochester?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I suppose not.''

<p/>Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his (<font color='blue'><b>Briggs</b></font>) application was not from Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed `Alice Fairfax.'
<p/>I felt cold and dismayed: my worst fears then were probably true: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had in all probability left England and rushed in reckless desperation to some former haunt on the Continent.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Of course. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) say? Who has his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) letters?'' '' '' And what opiate for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) severe sufferings--what object for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) strong passions--had he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sought there?
<p/>I dared not answer the question. Oh, my poor master--once almost my husband--whom I had often called <div class="bookquote">``my dear Edward!''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must have been a bad man,'' observed Mr. Rivers. '' You don't know him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>)--don't pronounce an opinion upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>), '' I said, with warmth.
<p/>'' Very well,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) answered quietly: <div class="bookquote">``and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>): I have my tale to finish.
<p/>Since you won't ask the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord. Stay! I have it here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black and white.
<p/>And the pocket-book was again deliberately produced, opened, sought through; from one of its compartments was extracted a shabby slip of paper, hastily torn off: I recognised in its texture and its stains of ultra-marine, and lake, and vermillion, the ravished margin of the portrait-cover.

<p/>And then there are other chances in life far more thrilling and rapture-giving: this is solid, an affair of the actual world, nothing ideal about it: all its associations are solid and sober, and its manifestations are the same.
<p/>at hearing one has got a fortune; one begins to consider responsibilities, and to ponder business; on a base of steady satisfaction rise certain grave cares, and we contain ourselves, and brood over our bliss with a solemn brow.
<p/>'' Here was a new card turned up! all at once. One does not jump, and spring, and shout hurrah! Besides, the words Legacy, Bequest, go side by side with the words, Death, Funeral.
<p/>my only relative; ever since being made aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) existence, I had cherished the hope of one day seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>): now, I never should.
<p/>My uncle I had heard was dead-- And then this money came only to me: not to me and a rejoicing family, but to my isolated self.
<p/>It was a grand boon doubtless; and independence would be glorious-- yes, I felt that--that thought swelled my heart. '' You unbend your forehead at last,'' said Mr. Rivers.
<p/>'' I thought Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone. Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``How much am I worth?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Oh, a trifle! Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I think they say--but what is that?''
<p/>This news actually took my breath for a moment: Mr. St. John, whom I had never heard laugh before, laughed now.
<p/>Well,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), ``if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Twenty thousand pounds? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Here was a new stunner--I had been calculating on four or five thousand. '' '' <div class="bookquote">``It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?''

<p/>I again felt rather like an individual of but average gastronomical powers sitting down to feast alone at a table spread with provisions for a hundred.
<p/>If it were not such a very wild night,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>individual</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I would send Hannah down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left alone.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Mr. Rivers rose now and put his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) cloak on. '' But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I: her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) legs are not quite so long:
<p/>so I must e`en leave you to your sorrows. Good-night. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) was lifting the latch: a sudden thought occurred to me.
<p/>``It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he (<font color='blue'><b>Briggs</b></font>) knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way place, had the power to aid in my discovery.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Stop one minute! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cried. '' Well?'' '' '' Oh! I am a clergyman,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``and the clergy are often appealed to about odd matters.
<p/>I exclaimed: and indeed there was something in the hasty and unexplanatory reply which, instead of allaying, piqued my curiosity more than ever.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Again the latch rattled. '' No; that does not satisfy me!'' '' It is a very strange piece of business,'' I added; <div class="bookquote">``I must know more about it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Another time.'' '' No; to-night!--to-night! '' and as he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) turned from the door, I placed myself between it and him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) looked rather embarrassed. '' You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,'' I said. '' I would rather not just now.
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``You shall!--you must!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I would rather Diana or Mary informed you. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Of course these objections wrought my eagerness to a climax:
<p/>gratified it must be, and that without delay; and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) so. '' But I apprised you that I was a hard man,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``difficult to persuade.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off. '' -LCB- And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off: p369.jpg-RCB-
<p/>'' And then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursued, <div class="bookquote">``I am cold: no fervour infects me.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.
<p/>The blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my floor, and made it like a trampled street.
<p/>As you hope ever to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.
<p/>Well, then,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' Besides, you must know some day,--as well now as later. Your name is Jane Eyre?'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course: that was all settled before.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I never asked for what name it stood.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No, indeed! But what then?
<p/>'' I stopped: I could not trust myself to entertain, much less to express, the thought that rushed upon me--that embodied itself,--that, in a second, stood out a strong, solid probability.
<p/>Circumstances knit themselves, fitted themselves, shot into order: the chain that had been lying hitherto a formless lump of links was drawn out straight,--every ring was perfect, the connection complete.
<p/>I knew, by instinct, how the matter stood, before St. John had said another word; but I cannot expect the reader to have the same intuitive perception, so I must repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) explanation.
<p/>Surely-- '' My mother's name was Eyre; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) had two brothers; one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.
<p/>Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had left his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) property to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) brother the clergyman's orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) and my father.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wrote again a few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>).
<p/>A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her (<font color='blue'><b>heiress</b></font>) out. You know the rest. ''
<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was going, but I set my back against the door. '' Do let me speak,'' I said; <div class="bookquote">``let me have one moment to draw breath and reflect.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I paused--he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) stood before me, hat in hand, looking composed enough. I resumed-- '' Your mother was my father's sister?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>'' My aunt, consequently?'' He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) bowed. '' My uncle John was your uncle John? You, Diana, and Mary are his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sister's children, as I am his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brother's child?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Undeniably.''  (<font color='red'><b>cousins</b></font>)</div>'' You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from the same source?'' <div class="bookquote">``We are cousins; yes.
<p/>It seemed I had found a brother: one I could be proud of,--one I could love; and two sisters, whose qualities were such, that, when I knew them but as mere strangers, they had inspired me with genuine affection and admiration.
<p/>The two girls, on whom, kneeling down on the wet ground, and looking through the low, latticed window of Moor House kitchen, I had gazed with so bitter a mixture of interest and despair, were my near kinswomen; and the young and stately gentleman who had found me almost dying at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) threshold was my blood relation.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I surveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). Glorious discovery to a lonely wretch! This was wealth indeed!--wealth to the heart!--a mine of pure, genial affections.
<p/>This was a blessing, bright, vivid, and exhilarating;--not like the ponderous gift of gold: rich and welcome enough in its way, but sobering from its weight.
<p/>I now clapped my hands in sudden joy--my pulse bounded, my veins thrilled. '' Oh, I am glad!--I am glad! ''
<p/>I exclaimed. St. John smiled. '' Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue trifles? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked. ''
<p/>You were serious when I told you you had got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.
<p/>It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world full-grown.
<p/>I walked fast through the room: I stopped, half suffocated with the thoughts that rose faster than I could receive, comprehend, settle them:--thoughts of what might, could, would, and should be, and that ere long.
<p/>'' '' What can you mean? I say again, I am glad! '' I looked at the blank wall: it seemed a sky thick with ascending stars,--every one
<p/>lit me to a purpose or delight. Those who had saved my life, whom, till this hour, I had loved barrenly, I could now benefit.
<p/>They were under a yoke,--I could free them: they were scattered,--I could reunite them: the independence, the affluence which was mine, might be theirs too.
<p/>Were we not four? Twenty thousand pounds shared equally would be five thousand each, justice--enough and to spare: justice would be done,--mutual happiness secured.
<p/>Now the wealth did not weigh on me: now it was not a mere bequest of coin,--it was a legacy of life, hope, enjoyment.
<p/>How I looked while these ideas were taking my spirit by storm, I cannot tell; but I perceived soon that Mr. Rivers had placed a chair behind me, and was gently attempting to make me sit down on it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) also advised me to be composed; I scorned the insinuation of helplessness and distraction, shook off his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) hand, and began to walk about again.
<p/>Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>said St. John; <div class="bookquote">``you must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``and tell them to come home directly. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?
<p/>Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down like an ordinary mortal?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You wander: your head becomes confused.
<p/>you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I have been too abrupt in communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength. '' ``Mr. Rivers! <div class="bookquote">``Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should comprehend better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the nephew nieces</b></font>)</div><p/>You cannot fail to see that twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?
<p/>What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the fortune that has accrued to them.''
<p/>``Explain! What is there to explain? <div class="bookquote">``To you, you mean. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any other.
<p/>I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful. Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.
<p/>I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary, and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.
<p/>It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice, though it might in law.
<p/>Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once.
<p/>This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely superfluous to me. '' '' '' Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of the case?''
<p/>Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own efforts; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was free to leave it to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would: he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) left it to you.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom. After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience, consider it absolutely your own.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``With me,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, ``it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so.
<p/>Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to myself lifelong friends.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You think so now,''  (<font color='red'><b>St. John/Mr. St. John/Mr. John</b></font>)</div>rejoined St. John, <div class="bookquote">``because you do not know what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to you: you cannot--''  (<font color='red'><b>St. John/Mr. St. John/Mr. John</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And you,''  (<font color='red'><b>St. John/Mr. St. John/Mr. John</b></font>)</div>I interrupted, <div class="bookquote">``cannot at all imagine the craving I have for fraternal and sisterly love.
<p/>I never had a home, I never had brothers or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.''
<p/>'' Brother? Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues! Sisters? Yes; slaving amongst strangers! I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit!
<p/>But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry.''
<p/>You, penniless! Famous equality and fraternisation! Close union! Intimate attachment!'' '' '' Nonsense, again! Marry! I don't want to marry, and never shall marry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.
<p/>No one would take me for love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation.
<p/>And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien, different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow- feeling.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the excitement under which you labour. ''  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>Say again you will be my brother:
<p/>when you uttered the words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely. '' <div class="bookquote">``I think I can.
<p/>I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and admiration of their talents.
<p/>You too have principle and mind: your tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace.
<p/>I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest sister. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Thank you: that contents me for to-night. Now you had better go; for if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Eyre</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And the school, Miss Eyre? It must now be shut up, I suppose?'' '' No. I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.
<p/>I need not narrate in detail the further struggles I had, and arguments I used, to get matters regarding the legacy settled as I wished.
<p/>My task was a very hard one; but, as I was absolutely resolved--as my cousins saw at length that my mind was really and immutably fixed on making a just division of the property--as they must in their own hearts have felt the equity of the intention; and must, besides, have been innately conscious that in my place they would have done precisely what I wished to do--they yielded at length so far as to consent to put the affair to arbitration.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) smiled approbation: we shook hands, and he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) took leave. The judges chosen were Mr. Oliver and an able lawyer: both coincided in my opinion:
<p/>I carried my point. The instruments of transfer were drawn out: St. John, Diana, Mary, and I, each became possessed of a competency.
<p/>CHAPTER XXXIV It was near Christmas by the time all was settled: the season of general holiday approached. I now closed Morton school, taking care that the parting should not be barren on my side.
<p/>Good fortune opens the hand as well as the heart wonderfully; and to give somewhat when we have largely received, is but to afford a vent to the unusual ebullition of the sensations.
<p/>I had long felt with pleasure that many of my rustic scholars liked me, and when we parted, that consciousness was confirmed: they manifested their affection plainly and strongly.
<p/>Deep was my gratification to find I had really a place in their unsophisticated hearts: I promised them that never a week should pass in future that I did not visit them, and give them an hour's teaching in their school.
<p/>Mr. Rivers came up as, having seen the classes, now numbering sixty girls, file out before me, and locked the door, I stood with the key in my hand, exchanging a few words of special farewell with some half-dozen of my best scholars: as decent, respectable, modest, and well-informed young women as could be found in the ranks of the British peasantry.
<p/>And that is saying a great deal; for after all, the British peasantry are the best taught, best mannered, most self-respecting of any in Europe: since those days I have seen paysannes and Bauerinnen; and the best of them seemed to me ignorant, coarse, and besotted, compared with my Morton girls.
<p/>'' Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?'' asked Mr. Rivers, when they were gone.
<p/>'' Does not the consciousness of having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?'' <div class="bookquote">``Doubtless.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' And you have only toiled a few months!
<p/>Would not a life devoted to the task of regenerating your race be well spent?'' '' Yes,'' I said; <div class="bookquote">``but I could not go on for ever so
<p/>I must enjoy them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of it and disposed for full holiday.
<p/>: I want to enjoy my own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) looked grave.
<p/>'' What now? What sudden eagerness is this you evince? What are you going to do?'' <div class="bookquote">``To be active: as active as I can.
<p/>And first I must beg you to set Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Do you want her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)?''
 (<font color='red'><b>Diana</b></font>)</div><p/>Diana and Mary will be at home in a week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Yes, to go with me to Moor House. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I understand. I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.
<p/>It is better so : Hannah shall go with you.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key
<p/>You give it up very gleefully,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``I don't quite understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing.
<p/>: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) took it. '' What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?''
<p/>My first aim will be to clean down -LRB-do you comprehend the full force of the expression?-RRB---to clean down Moor House from chamber to cellar; my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you.
<p/>My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.
<p/>It is all very well for the present,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``but seriously, I trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' '' St. John smiled slightly: still he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was dissatisfied. '' '' The best things the world has! '' I interrupted.
<p/>No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful.''
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``I mean, on the contrary, to be busy. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div>'' Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace
<p/>I allow you for the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with this late-found charm of relationship; but then , I hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.
<p/>I hope your energies will then once more trouble you with their strength. '' I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) with surprise. ''
<p/>St. John,'' I said, ``I think you are almost wicked to talk so. I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and you try to stir me up to restlessness!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to your keeping; and of which He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will surely one day demand a strict account.
<p/>To what end?''  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Eyre/Eyre</b></font>)</div>Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously --I warn you of that. And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.
<p/>Don't cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.
<p/>Do you hear, Jane?'' '' Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek. I feel I have adequate cause to be happy, and I will be happy.
<p/>: she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was charmed to see how jovial I could be amidst the bustle of a house turned topsy-turvy--how I could brush, and dust, and clean, and cook.
<p/>And really, after a day or two of confusion worse confounded, it was delightful by degrees to invoke order from the chaos ourselves had made.
<p/>I had previously taken a journey to S-- to purchase some new furniture: my cousins having given me carte blanche to effect what alterations I pleased, and a sum having been set aside for that purpose.
<p/>Goodbye! '' Happy at Moor House I was, and hard I worked; and so did Hannah The ordinary sitting-room and bedrooms
<p/>for I knew Diana and Mary would derive more pleasure from seeing again the old homely tables, and chairs, and beds, than from the spectacle of the smartest innovations.
<p/>I left much as they were: Still some novelty was necessary, to give to their return the piquancy with which I wished it to be invested.
<p/>Dark handsome new carpets and curtains, an arrangement of some carefully selected antique ornaments in porcelain and bronze, new coverings, and mirrors, and dressing-cases, for the toilet tables, answered the end: they looked fresh without being glaring.
<p/>A spare parlour and bedroom I refurnished entirely, with old mahogany and crimson upholstery: I laid canvas on the passage, and carpets on the stairs.
<p/>When all was finished, I thought Moor House as complete a model of bright modest snugness within, as it was, at this season, a specimen of wintry waste and desert dreariness without.
<p/>They were expected about dark, and ere dusk fires were lit upstairs and below; the kitchen was in perfect trim; Hannah and I were dressed, and all was in readiness.
<p/>I had entreated him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) to keep quite clear of the house till everything was arranged: and, indeed, the bare idea of the commotion, at once sordid and trivial, going on within its walls sufficed to scare him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) to estrangement.
<p/>The eventful Thursday at length came. St. John arrived first. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) found me in the kitchen, watching the progress of certain cakes for tea, then baking.
<p/>Approaching the hearth, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked, <div class="bookquote">``If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work? ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I answered by inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to accompany me on a general inspection of the result of my labours.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) just looked in at the doors I opened; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had wandered upstairs and downstairs, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said I must have gone through a great deal of fatigue and trouble to have effected such considerable changes in so short a time: but not a syllable did he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) utter indicating pleasure in the improved aspect of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) abode.
<p/>With some difficulty, I got him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to make the tour of the house. This silence damped me. I thought perhaps the alterations had disturbed some old associations he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) valued.
<p/>Not at all; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously respected every association: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth.
<p/>How many minutes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye, could I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) where such a book was?
<p/>I showed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) the volume on the shelf: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took it down, and withdrawing to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) accustomed window recess, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) began to read it.
<p/>I inquired whether this was the case: no doubt in a somewhat crest-fallen tone. '' '' Now, I did not like this, reader.
<p/>St. John was a good man; but I began to feel he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had spoken truth of himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was hard and cold.
<p/>Literally, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lived only to aspire--after what was good and great, certainly; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would never rest, nor approve of others resting round him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>As I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lofty forehead, still and pale as a white stone--at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fine lineaments fixed in study--I comprehended all at once that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would hardly make a good husband: that it would be a trying thing to be his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wife.
<p/>I understood, as by inspiration, the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) love for Miss Oliver; I agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that it was but a love of the senses.
<p/>I comprehended how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should despise himself for the feverish influence it exercised over him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should wish to stifle and destroy it; how he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should mistrust its ever conducting permanently to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) happiness or hers.
<p/>I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was of the material from which nature hews her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) heroes--Christian and Pagan--her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) lawgivers, her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) statesmen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) conquerors: a steadfast bulwark for great interests to rest upon; but, at the fireside, too often a cold cumbrous column, gloomy and out of place.
<p/>This parlour is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) sphere,'' I reflected: <div class="bookquote">``the Himalayan ridge or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) better.
<p/>Well may he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) element: there his (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to advantage.
<p/>It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) will speak and move, the leader and superior.
<p/>The humanities and amenities of life had no attraction for him (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>)--its peaceful enjoyments no charm. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A merry child would have the advantage of him (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) on this hearth.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Pagan</b></font>) is right to choose a missionary's career --I see it now. '' '' They are coming! they are coming! '' cried Hannah, throwing open the parlour door.
<p/>At the same moment old Carlo barked joyfully. Out I ran. It was now dark; but a rumbling of wheels was audible.
<p/>Hannah soon had a lantern lit. The vehicle had stopped at the wicket; the driver opened the door: first one well-known form, then another, stepped out.
<p/>In a minute I had my face under their bonnets, in contact first with Mary's soft cheek, then with Diana's flowing curls.
<p/>Hannah: patted Carlo, who was half wild with delight; asked eagerly if all was well; and being assured in the affirmative, hastened into the house.
<p/>They were stiff with their long and jolting drive from Whitcross, and chilled with the frosty night air; but their pleasant countenances expanded to the cheerful firelight.
<p/>They laughed--kissed me--then While the driver and Hannah brought in the boxes, they demanded St. John. At this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) advanced from the parlour.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gave each one quiet kiss, said in a low tone a few words of welcome, stood a while to be talked to, and then, intimating that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) supposed they would soon rejoin him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in the parlour, withdrew there as to a place of refuge.
<p/>I had lit their candles to go upstairs, but Diana had first to give hospitable orders respecting the driver; this done, both followed me.
<p/>They were delighted with the renovation and decorations of their rooms; with the new drapery, and fresh carpets, and rich tinted china vases: they expressed their gratification ungrudgingly.
<p/>I had the pleasure of feeling that my arrangements met their wishes exactly, and that what I had done added a vivid charm to their joyous return home.
<p/>They both threw their arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>driver</b></font>) neck at once. Sweet was that evening. My cousins, full of exhilaration, were so eloquent in narrative and comment, that their fluency covered St. John's taciturnity:
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was sincerely glad to see his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sisters; but in their glow of fervour and flow of joy he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could not sympathise.
<p/>The event of the day--that is, the return of Diana and Mary--pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); but the accompaniments of that event, the glad tumult, the garrulous glee of reception irked him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>): I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wished the calmer morrow was come.
<p/>Hannah entered with the intimation that <div class="bookquote">``a poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) mother, who was drawing away.''
 (<font color='red'><b>Hannah</b></font>)</div><p/>In the very meridian of the night's enjoyment, about an hour after tea, a rap was heard at the door. <div class="bookquote">``Where does she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) live, Hannah?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the way.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) I will go.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' I'm sure, sir, you had better not. It's the worst road to travel after dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.
<p/>And then it is such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt. You had better send word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.
<p/>'' But he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) was already in the passage, putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) cloak; and without one objection, one murmur, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) departed. It was then nine o'clock: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) did not return till midnight.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) had performed an act of duty; made an exertion; felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) own strength to do and deny, and was on better terms with himself.
<p/>Starved and tired enough he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) was: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) looked happier than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) set out. I am afraid the whole of the ensuing week tried his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) patience.
<p/>The air of the moors, the freedom of home, the dawn of prosperity, acted on Diana and Mary's spirits like some life-giving elixir: they were gay from morning till noon, and from noon till night.
<p/>They could always talk; and their discourse, witty, pithy, original, had such charms for me, that I preferred listening to, and sharing in it, to doing anything else.
<p/>It was Christmas week: we took to no settled employment, but spent it in a sort of merry domestic dissipation. St. John did not rebuke our vivacity; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) escaped from it:
<p/>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was seldom in the house; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) parish was large, the population scattered, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) found daily business in visiting the sick and poor in its different districts.
<p/>One morning at breakfast, Diana, after looking a little pensive for some minutes, asked him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``If his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) plans were yet unchanged.''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Unchanged and unchangeable,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the reply. And he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) proceeded to inform us that his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) departure from England was now definitively fixed for the ensuing year.
<p/>'' suggested Mary, the words seeming to escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) lips involuntarily: for no sooner had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) uttered them, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made a gesture as if wishing to recall them.
<p/>St. John had a book in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand--it was his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) unsocial custom to read at meals--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) closed it, and looked up.
<p/>Rosamond Oliver,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her (<font color='blue'><b>Oliver</b></font>) father yesterday.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And Rosamond Oliver? '' '' His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) sisters looked at each other and at me; we all three looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was serene as glass.
<p/>'' The match must have been got up hastily,'' said Diana: <div class="bookquote">``they cannot have known each other long.''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana</b></font>)</div>'' But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.
<p/>But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will be married as soon as S-- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them, can he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederic</b></font>) refitted for their reception.
<p/>The first time I found St. John alone after this communication, I felt tempted to inquire if the event distressed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>): but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed so little to need sympathy, that, so far from venturing to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) more, I experienced some shame at the recollection of what I had already hazarded.
<p/>'' Besides, I was out of practice in talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) : his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) reserve was again frozen over, and my frankness was congealed beneath it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not kept his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) promise of treating me like his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sisters; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) continually made little chilling differences between us, which did not at all tend to the development of cordiality: in short, now that I was acknowledged his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) kinswoman, and lived under the same roof with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), I felt the distance between us to be far greater than when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had known me only as the village schoolmistress.
<p/>Such being the case, I felt not a little surprised when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) raised his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head suddenly from the desk over which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was stooping, and said--
<p/>When I remembered how far I had once been admitted to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) confidence, I could hardly comprehend his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) present frigidity. <div class="bookquote">``You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Startled at being thus addressed, I did not immediately reply: after a moment's hesitation I answered-- ``But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose triumphs have cost them too dear?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be called upon to contend for such another.
<p/>Would not such another ruin you?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The event of the conflict is decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!''
<p/>As our mutual happiness -LRB- i.e. , Diana's, Mary's, and mine-RRB- settled into a quieter character, and we resumed our usual habits and regular studies, St. John stayed more at home: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sat with us in the same room, sometimes for hours together.
<p/>While Mary drew, Diana pursued a course of encyclopaedic reading she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had -LRB-to my awe and amazement-RRB- undertaken, and I fagged away at German, he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) pondered a mystic lore of his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) own: that of some Eastern tongue, the acquisition of which he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) thought necessary to his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) plans.
<p/>Thus engaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) appeared, sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) own recess, quiet and absorbed enough; but that blue eye of his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) had a habit of leaving the outlandish- looking grammar, and wandering over, and sometimes fixing upon us, his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) fellow-students, with a curious intensity of observation: if caught, it would be instantly withdrawn; yet ever and anon, it returned searchingly to our table.
<p/>I wondered what it meant: I wondered, too, at the punctual satisfaction he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) never failed to exhibit on an occasion that seemed to me of small moment, namely, my weekly visit to Morton school; and still more was I puzzled when, if the day was unfavourable, if there was snow, or rain, or high wind, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) sisters urged me not to go, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) would invariably make light of their solicitude, and encourage me to accomplish the task without regard to the elements.
<p/>Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>),'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) would say: <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of us.
<p/>So saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) papers and his (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) silence. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) constitution is both sound and elastic;--better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.
<p/>And when I returned, sometimes a good deal tired, and not a little weather-beaten, I never dared complain, because I saw that to murmur would be to vex him (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>): on all occasions fortitude pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>); the reverse was a special annoyance.
<p/>'' One afternoon, however, I got leave to stay at home, because I really had a cold. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) sisters were gone to Morton in my stead: I sat reading Schiller; he (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>), deciphering his (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) crabbed Oriental scrolls.
<p/>As I exchanged a translation for an exercise, I happened to look his (<font color='blue'><b>Schiller</b></font>) way: there I found myself under the influence of the ever-watchful blue eye.
<p/>How long it had been searching me through and through, and over and over, I cannot tell: so keen was it, and yet so cold, I felt for the moment superstitious--as if I were sitting in the room with something uncanny.
<p/>'' Jane, what are you doing?'' <div class="bookquote">``Learning German.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You are not in earnest?''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) then went on to explain that Hindostanee was the language he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) was himself at present studying; that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) advanced, he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) was apt to forget the commencement; that it would assist him (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) greatly to have a pupil with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) might again and again go over the elements, and so fix them thoroughly in his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) mind; that his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) choice had hovered for some time between me and his (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) sisters; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) had fixed on me because he (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) saw I could sit at a task the longest of the three.
<p/>'' In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why. '' Would I do him (<font color='blue'><b>German</b></font>) this favour?
<p/>St. John was not a man to be lightly refused: you felt that every impression made on him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), either for pain or pleasure, was deep-graved and permanent.
<p/>I should not, perhaps, have to make the sacrifice long, as it wanted now barely three months to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) departure. I consented.
<p/>When Diana and Mary returned, the former found her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) scholar transferred from her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) brother: she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) laughed, and both she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) and Mary agreed that St. John should never have persuaded them to such a step.
<p/>I found him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a very patient, very forbearing, and yet an exacting master: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) expected me to do a great deal; and when I fulfilled his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) expectations, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own way, fully testified his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) approbation.
<p/>By degrees, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) acquired a certain influence over me that took away my liberty of mind: his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) praise and notice were more restraining than his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) indifference.
<p/>I could no longer talk or laugh freely when he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was by, because a tiresomely importunate instinct reminded me that vivacity -LRB-at least in me-RRB-
<p/>I was so fully aware that only serious moods and occupations were acceptable, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) presence every effort to sustain or follow any other
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) answered quietly-- <div class="bookquote">``I know it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was distasteful to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). became vain: I fell under a freezing spell. When he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) said <div class="bookquote">``go,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I went; <div class="bookquote">``come,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I came; <div class="bookquote">``do this,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did it.
<p/>One evening when, at bedtime, his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sisters and I stood round him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), bidding him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) good-night, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) kissed each of them, as was his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) custom; and,
<p/>But I did not love my servitude : I wished, many a time, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had continued to neglect me. as was equally his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) custom, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) gave me his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) hand.
<p/>Diana, who chanced to be in a frolicsome humour -LRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) was not painfully controlled by his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will; for hers, in another way, was as strong-RRB-, exclaimed-- <div class="bookquote">``St. John!
<p/>you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) as such: you should kiss her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) too. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>I thought Diana very provoking, and felt uncomfortably confused; and while I was thus thinking and feeling, St. John bent his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) head; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) Greek face was brought to a level with mine, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes questioned my eyes piercingly--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) kissed me.
<p/>There are no such things as marble kisses or ice kisses, or I should say my ecclesiastical cousin's salute belonged to one of these classes; but there may be experiment kisses, and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was an experiment kiss.
<p/>When given, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) viewed me to learn the result; it was not striking: I am sure I did not blush; perhaps I might have turned a little pale, for I felt as if this kiss were a seal affixed to my fetters.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) never omitted the ceremony afterwards, and the gravity and quiescence with which I underwent it, seemed to invest it for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) with a certain charm.
<p/>As for me, I daily wished more to please him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>); but to do so, I felt daily more and more that I must disown half my nature, stifle half my faculties, wrest my tastes from their original bent, force myself to the adoption of pursuits for which I had no natural vocation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wanted to train me to an elevation I could never reach; it racked me hourly to aspire to the standard he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) uplifted.
<p/>The thing was as impossible as to mould my irregular features to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) correct and classic pattern, to give to my changeable green eyes the sea-blue tint and solemn lustre of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own.
<p/>Of late it had been easy enough for me to look sad: a cankering evil sat at my heart and drained my happiness at its source--the evil of suspense.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) pushed me towards him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). Not his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) ascendancy alone, however, held me in thrall at present. Perhaps you think I had forgotten Mr. Rochester, reader, amidst these changes of place and fortune.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) idea was still with me, because it was not a vapour sunshine could disperse, nor a sand-traced effigy storms could wash away; it was a name graven on a tablet, fated to last as long as the marble it inscribed.
<p/>The craving to know what had become of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) followed me everywhere; when I was at Morton, I re-entered my cottage every evening to think of that; and now at Moor House, I sought my bedroom each night to brood over it.
<p/>In the course of my necessary correspondence with Mr. Briggs about the will, I had inquired if he (<font color='blue'><b>Briggs</b></font>) knew anything of Mr. Rochester's present residence and state of health; but, as St. John had conjectured, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was quite ignorant of all concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>Not for a moment. I then wrote to Mrs. Fairfax, entreating information on the subject. I had calculated with certainty on this step answering my end
<p/>I was astonished when a fortnight passed without reply; but when two months wore away, and day after day the post arrived and brought nothing for me, I fell a prey to the keenest anxiety.
<p/>: I felt sure it would elicit an early answer. I wrote again: there was a chance of my first letter having missed.
<p/>Renewed hope followed renewed effort: it shone like the former for some weeks, then, like it, it faded, flickered: not a line, not a word reached me.
<p/>When half a year wasted in vain expectancy, my hope died out, and then I felt dark indeed. A fine spring shone round me, which I could not enjoy.
<p/>Summer approached; Diana tried to cheer me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) said I looked ill, and wished to accompany me to the sea-side. This St. John opposed; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said I did not want dissipation
<p/>, I wanted employment; my present life was too purposeless, I required an aim; and, I suppose, by way of supplying deficiencies, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) prolonged still further my lessons in Hindostanee, and grew more urgent in requiring their accomplishment: and I, like a fool, never thought of resisting him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)--I could not resist him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).
<p/>One day I had come to my studies in lower spirits than usual; the ebb was occasioned by a poignantly felt disappointment.
<p/>Hannah had told me in the morning there was a letter for me, and when I went down to take it, almost certain that the long-looked for tidings were vouchsafed me at last, I found only an unimportant note from Mr. Briggs on business.
<p/>The bitter check had wrung from me some tears; and now, as I sat poring over the crabbed characters and flourishing tropes of an Indian scribe, my eyes filled again.
<p/>St. John called me to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) side to read; in attempting to do this my voice failed me: words were lost in sobs.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and I were the only occupants of the parlour: Diana was practising her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) music in the drawing-room, Mary was gardening--it was a very fine May day, clear, sunny, and breezy.
<p/>My companion expressed no surprise at this emotion, nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) question me as to its cause; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) only said-- <div class="bookquote">``We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.
<p/>And while I smothered the paroxysm with all haste, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sat calm and patient, leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) desk, and looking like a physician watching with the eye of science an expected and fully understood crisis in a patient's malady.
<p/>Having stifled my sobs, wiped my eyes, and muttered something about not being very well that morning, I resumed my task, and succeeded in completing it.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>St. John put away my books and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), locked his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) desk, and said-- <div class="bookquote">``Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.''
 (<font color='red'><b>St. John/Mr. St. John/Mr. John</b></font>)</div><p/>Put on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I will call Diana and Mary.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you. ''
<p/>I know no medium: I never in my life have known any medium in my dealings with positive, hard characters, antagonistic to my own, between absolute submission and determined revolt.
<p/>I have always faithfully observed the one, up to the very moment of bursting, sometimes with volcanic vehemence, into the other; and as neither present circumstances warranted, nor my present mood inclined me to mutiny, I observed careful obedience to St. John's directions; and in ten minutes I was treading the wild track of the glen, side by side with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>The breeze was from the west: it came over the hills, sweet with scents of heath and rush; the sky was of stainless blue; the stream descending the ravine, swelled with past spring rains, poured along plentiful and clear, catching golden gleams from the sun, and sapphire tints from the firmament.
<p/>As we advanced and left the track, we trod a soft turf, mossy fine and emerald green, minutely enamelled with a tiny white flower, and spangled with a star-like yellow blossom: the hills, meantime, shut us quite in; for the glen, towards its head, wound to their very core.
<p/>Let us rest here,'' said St. John, as we reached the first stragglers of a battalion of rocks, guarding a sort of pass, beyond which the beck rushed down a waterfall; and where, still a little farther, the mountain shook off turf and flower, had only heath for raiment and crag for gem--where it exaggerated the wild to the savage, and exchanged the fresh for the frowning--where it guarded the forlorn hope of solitude, and a last refuge for silence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looked up the pass and down the hollow; his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) glance wandered away with the stream, and returned to traverse the unclouded heaven which coloured it: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) removed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hat, let the breeze stir his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hair and kiss his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) brow.
<p/>'' I took a seat: St. John stood near me. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seemed in communion with the genius of the haunt: with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eye he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) bade farewell to something.
<p/>And I shall see it again,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said aloud, <div class="bookquote">``in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes me--on the shore of a darker stream!''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>'' Strange words of a strange love! An austere patriot's passion for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fatherland! He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sat down; for half-an-hour we never spoke; neither he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to me nor I to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>):
<p/>that interval past, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) recommenced-- <div class="bookquote">``Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails on the 20th of June.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``God will protect you; for you have undertaken His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) work,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. '' Yes,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``there is my glory and joy.
<p/>I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.
<p/>It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the same enterprise.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I am the servant of an infallible Master. '' All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to march with the strong.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) chosen.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?
<p/>I felt as if an awful charm was framing round and gathering over me: I trembled to hear some fatal word spoken which would at once declare and rivet the spell.
<p/>'' Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.'' '' '' '' And what does your heart say?'' demanded St. John.
<p/>'' My heart is mute,--my heart is mute,'' I answered, struck and thrilled. '' Then I must speak for it,'' continued the deep, relentless voice.
<p/>'' Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer. '' The glen and sky spun round: the hills heaved!
<p/>It was as if I had heard a summons from Heaven--as if a visionary messenger, like him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) of Macedonia, had enounced, <div class="bookquote">``Come over and help us!''
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>But I was no apostle,--I could not behold the herald,--I could not receive his (<font color='blue'><b>apostle</b></font>) call. '' Oh, St. John! '' I cried, <div class="bookquote">``have some mercy!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I appealed to one who, in the discharge of what he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) believed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) duty, knew neither mercy nor remorse. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) continued--
<p/><div class="bookquote">``God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife. It is not personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for labour, not for love.
<p/>A missionary's wife you must--shall be. You shall be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's service.''
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had calculated on these first objections: he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was not irritated by them.
<p/>, I saw he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was prepared for a long and trying opposition, and had taken in a stock of patience to last him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to its close--resolved, however, that that close should be conquest for him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).
<p/>Indeed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) leaned back against the crag behind him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), folded his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) arms on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) chest, and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) countenance ''
<p/>Humility, Jane,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you say right that you are not fit for the work.
<p/>Who is fit for it? Or who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons? I, for instance, am but dust and ashes.

<p/>I know my Leader: that He (<font color='blue'><b>Leader</b></font>) is just as well as mighty; and while He (<font color='blue'><b>Leader</b></font>) has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task, He (<font color='blue'><b>Leader</b></font>) will, from the boundless stores of His (<font color='blue'><b>Leader</b></font>) providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end.
<p/>Think like me, Jane--trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to moment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary labours.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' This I could do in the beginning:
<p/>soon -LRB-for I know your powers-RRB- you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help.''
<p/>'' But my powers--where are they for this undertaking? I do not feel them. Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.
<p/>Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!''
<p/>I am sensible of no light kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering. <div class="bookquote">``I have an answer for you--hear it. I have watched you ever since we first met: I have made you my study for ten months.
<p/>In the village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly, labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.
<p/>In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.
<p/>In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of sacrifice.
<p/>In the tractability with which, at my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek.
<p/>Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.
<p/>I have proved you in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited? As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will be to me invaluable.
<p/>Shut my eyes as I would, these last words of his (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) succeeded in making the way, which had seemed blocked up, comparatively clear.
<p/>My work, which had appeared so vague, so hopelessly diffuse, condensed itself as he (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) proceeded, and assumed a definite form under his (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) shaping hand.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>My iron shroud contracted round me; persuasion advanced with slow sure step. He (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) waited for an answer. I demanded a quarter of an hour to think, before I again hazarded a reply.
<p/>Very willingly,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) rejoined; and rising, he (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) strode a little distance up the pass, threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still.
<p/>I can do what he (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge that,'' I meditated,--<div class="bookquote">``that is, if life be spared me.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LCB- He (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) threw himself down on a swell of heath, and there lay still: p389.jpg-RCB- '' But I feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) does not care for that: when my time came to die, he (<font color='blue'><b>helper</b></font>) would resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.
<p/>What then? The case is very plain before me. In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) were, what is, what can that ever be to me?
<p/>My business is to live without him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).
<p/>Of course -LRB-as St. John once said-RRB- I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign?
<p/>Is it not, by its noble cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes?
<p/>I believe I must say, Yes--and yet I shudder. Alas! If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I go to premature death.
<p/>And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled? Oh, I know well!
<p/>By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I shall satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) expectations.
<p/>If I do go with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--if I do make the sacrifice he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire victim.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) will never love me; but he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) shall approve me; I will show him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) energies he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) has not yet seen, resources he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) has never suspected.
<p/>That, too, is very clear to my vision. Yes, I can work as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) can, and with as little grudging.
<p/>It is--that he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) asks me to be his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) wife, and has no more of a husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge.
<p/>'' Consent, then, to his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful item. He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and that is all.
<p/>Unmarried to him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>), this would never grieve me; but can I let him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) complete his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) calculations--coolly put into practice his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) plans--go through the wedding ceremony?
<p/>Can I receive from him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love -LRB-which I doubt not he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) would scrupulously observe-RRB- and know that the spirit was quite absent?
<p/>Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) bestows is a sacrifice made on principle? No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.
<p/>I will never undergo it. As his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) sister, I might accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>)--not as his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) wife: I will tell him (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) so. ''
<p/>I looked towards the knoll: there he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) lay, still as a prostrate column; his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) face turned to me: his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) eye beaming watchful and keen.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) started to his (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) feet and approached me. '' I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.''
<p/>'' Your answer requires a commentary,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>victim</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``it is not clear.''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister:
<p/>let us continue as such: you and I had better not marry. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) head. '' Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.
<p/>But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to any other plan.
<p/>If you were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no wife. Do you not see it, Jane?
<p/>I did consider; and still my sense, such as it was, directed me only to the fact that we did not love each other as man and wife should: and therefore it inferred we ought not to marry.
<p/>Consider a moment--your strong sense will guide you. '' I said so. '' St. John,'' I returned, <div class="bookquote">``I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us continue.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' We cannot--we cannot,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answered, with short, sharp determination: <div class="bookquote">``it would not do. You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you have said that.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Conditionally. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Well--well. To the main point--the departure with me from England, the co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.
<p/>You have already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to withdraw it. You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have undertaken can best be done.
<p/>Simplify your complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your great Master.
<p/>To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that is a loose tie--but a husband. I, too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from me.
<p/>I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death. '' I shuddered as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) spoke: I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) influence in my marrow--his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) hold on my limbs.
<p/>'' Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.'' '' One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.
<p/>Again I tell you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with the man's selfish senses-- I wish to mate: it is the missionary.''
<p/>And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wants--but not myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.
<p/>'' For them he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no use: I retain them.'' '' You cannot--you ought not. Do you think God will be satisfied with half an oblation?
<p/>Will He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) accept a mutilated sacrifice? It is the cause of God I advocate: it is under His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) standard I enlist you.
<p/>I cannot accept on His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.'' '' Oh! I will give my heart to God,'' I said.
<p/>I will not swear, reader, that there was not something of repressed sarcasm both in the tone in which I uttered this sentence, and in the feeling that accompanied it.
<p/>'' You do not want it. '' I had silently feared St. John till now, because I had not understood him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>How much of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was saint, how much mortal, I could not heretofore tell: but revelations were being made in this conference: the analysis of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) nature was proceeding before my eyes.
<p/>I understood that, sitting there where I did, on the bank of heath, and with that handsome form before me, I sat at the feet of a man, caring as I.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had held me in awe, because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had held me in doubt. I saw his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fallibilities: I comprehended them. The veil fell from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hardness and despotism.
<p/>Having felt in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the presence of these qualities, I felt his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imperfection and took courage. I was with an equal--one with whom I might argue--one whom, if I saw good, I might resist.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was silent after I had uttered the last sentence, and I presently risked an upward glance at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, bent on me, expressed at once stern surprise and keen inquiry.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said ere long; <div class="bookquote">``one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Is she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sarcastic, and sarcastic to me ! '' it seemed to say. '' What does this signify?'' I trust,
<p/>Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to God : it is all I want.
<p/>Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end.
<p/>You will see what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once.''
<p/>I said briefly; and I looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) features, beautiful in their harmony, but strangely formidable in their still severity; at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) brow, commanding but not open; at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) eyes, bright and deep and searching, but never soft; at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) tall imposing figure; and fancied myself in idea his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife .
<p/>As his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) curate, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) comrade, all would be right: I would cross oceans with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in that capacity; toil under Eastern suns, in Asian deserts with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in that office; admire and emulate his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) courage and devotion and vigour; accommodate quietly to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) masterhood; smile undisturbed at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) ineradicable ambition; discriminate the Christian from the man: profoundly esteem the one, and freely forgive the other.
<p/>I should suffer often, no doubt, attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) only in this capacity: my body would be under rather a stringent yoke, but my heart and mind would be free.
<p/>I should still have my unblighted self to turn to: my natural unenslaved feelings with which to communicate in moments of loneliness.
<p/>There would be recesses in my mind which would be only mine, to which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) never came, and sentiments growing there fresh and sheltered which his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) austerity could never blight, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) measured warrior-march trample down: but as his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife--at his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) side always, and always restrained, and always checked--forced to keep the fire of my nature continually low, to compel it to burn inwardly and never utter a cry, though the imprisoned flame consumed vital after vital-- this would be unendurable.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Shall I? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! it would never do! '' St. John! '' I exclaimed, when I had got so far in my meditation.
<p/>I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.''
<p/>'' Well?'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) answered icily. '' <div class="bookquote">``A part of me you must become,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) answered steadily; ``otherwise the whole bargain is void.
<p/>How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) be married to me?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Very well,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said shortly; <div class="bookquote">``under the circumstances, quite as well as if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like yourself.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.
<p/>How can we be for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes--and unwed?'' '' And for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's heart and--it would not do.''
<p/>I have a woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) hierophant: nothing more--don't fear.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would do,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I affirmed with some disdain, <div class="bookquote">``perfectly well. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``It is what I want,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>) said, speaking to himself; <div class="bookquote">``it is just what I want.
<p/>And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down. Jane, you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we must be married.
<p/>I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your eyes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I scorn your idea of love,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not help saying, as I rose up and stood before him (<font color='blue'><b>comrade</b></font>), leaning my back against the rock.
<p/>'' I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer it. '' He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looked at me fixedly, compressing his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) well-cut lips while he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did so.
<p/>Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was incensed or surprised, or what, it was not easy to tell: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could command his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) countenance thoroughly. ''
<p/>I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said: ``I think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have been roused to speak so unguardedly.
<p/>You have introduced a topic on which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between us.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was touched by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gentle tone, and overawed by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) high, calm mien. If the reality were required, what should we do?
<p/>No,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present.

<p/>I shall be absent a fortnight--take that space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but God.
<p/>Through my means, He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) opens to you a noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it. Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity.
<p/>Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had done. Turning from me, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) once more <div class="bookquote">``Looked to river, looked to hill. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But this time his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) feelings were all pent in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) heart: I was not worthy to hear them uttered.
<p/>As I walked by his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) side homeward, I read well in his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) iron silence all he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt towards me: the disappointment of an austere and despotic nature, which has met resistance where it expected submission--the disapprobation of a cool, inflexible judgment, which has detected in another feelings and views in which it has no power to sympathise: in short, as a man, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have wished to coerce me into obedience: it was only as a sincere Christian he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) bore so patiently with my perversity, and allowed so long a space for reflection and repentance.
<p/>That night, after he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had kissed his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) sisters, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) thought proper to forget even to shake hands with me, but left the room in silence.
<p/>I--who, though I had no love, had much friendship for him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)--was hurt by the marked omission: so much hurt that tears started to my eyes.
<p/>'' I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,'' said Diana, <div class="bookquote">``during your walk on the moor. But go after him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is now lingering in the passage expecting you--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will make it up.
<p/>I have not much pride under such circumstances: I would always rather be happy than dignified; and I ran after him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Diana</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stood at the foot of the stairs. '' Good-night, St. John,'' said I. <div class="bookquote">``Good-night, Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) replied calmly. ''
<p/>Then shake hands,'' I added. What a cold, loose touch, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) impressed on my fingers! He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was deeply displeased by what had occurred that day; cordiality would not warm, nor tears move him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>No happy reconciliation was to be had with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)-- no cheering smile or generous word: but still the Christian was patient and placid; and
<p/>when I asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) forgave me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was not in the habit of cherishing the remembrance of vexation; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had nothing to forgive, not having been offended.
<p/>And with that answer he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) left me. I would much rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had knocked me down. CHAPTER XXXV He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) did not leave for Cambridge the next day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) would.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) deferred his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) departure a whole week, and during that time he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) made me feel what severe punishment a good yet stern, a conscientious yet implacable man can inflict on one who has offended him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).
<p/>Without one overt act of hostility, one upbraiding word, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contrived to impress me momently with the conviction that I was put beyond the pale of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favour.
<p/>Not that St. John harboured a spirit of unchristian vindictiveness--not that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have injured a hair of my head, if it had been fully in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) power to do so.
<p/>Both by nature and principle, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was superior to the mean gratification of vengeance: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had forgiven me for saying I scorned him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) love, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not forgotten the words; and as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and I lived he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) never would forget them.
<p/>I saw by his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) look, when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned to me, that they were always written on the air between me and him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); whenever I spoke, they sounded in my voice to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ear, and their echo toned every answer he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gave me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not abstain from conversing with me: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) even called me as usual each morning to join him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) desk; and I fear the corrupt man within him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a pleasure unimparted to, and unshared by, the pure Christian, in evincing with what skill he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) could, while acting and speaking apparently just as usual, extract from every deed and every phrase the spirit of interest and approval which had formerly communicated a certain austere charm to his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) language and manner.
<p/>To me, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was in reality become no longer flesh, but marble; his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) eye was a cold, bright, blue gem; his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) tongue a speaking instrument--nothing more.
<p/>All this was torture to me--refined, lingering torture. It kept up a slow fire of indignation and a trembling trouble of grief, which harassed and crushed me altogether.
<p/>I felt how--if I were his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) wife, this good man, pure as the deep sunless source, could soon kill me, without drawing from my veins a single drop of blood, or receiving on his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) own crystal conscience the faintest stain of crime.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) experienced no suffering from estrangement--no yearning after reconciliation; and though, more than once, my fast falling tears blistered the page over which we both bent, they produced no more effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) than if his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) heart had been really a matter of stone or metal.
<p/>To his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) sisters, meantime, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) was somewhat kinder than usual: as if afraid that mere coldness would not sufficiently convince me how completely I was banished and banned, he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) added the force of contrast; and this I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) did not by force, but on principle.
<p/>The night before he (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) left home, happening to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) walking in the garden about sunset, and remembering, as I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>), that this man, alienated as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now was, had once saved my life, and that we were near relations, I was moved to make a last attempt to regain his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friendship.
<p/>I went out and approached him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood leaning over the little gate; I spoke to the point at once.
<p/>Especially I felt this when I made any attempt to propitiate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). No ruth met my ruth. '' St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I hope we are friends,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was the unmoved reply; while he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) still watched the rising of the moon, which he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had been contemplating as I approached.
<p/>Let us be friends.'' '' No, St. John, we are not friends as we were. You know that.'' ``Are we not?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>That is wrong. For my part, I wish you no ill and all good.'' <div class="bookquote">``Of course,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said. '' Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from regarding you as a stranger.
<p/>Had I attended to the suggestions of pride and ire, I should immediately have left him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>); but something worked within me more strongly than those feelings could.
<p/>'' This, spoken in a cool, tranquil tone, was mortifying and baffling enough. I deeply venerated my cousin's talent and principle.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) friendship was of value to me: to lose it tried me severely. I would not so soon relinquish the attempt to reconquer it.
<p/>'' Must we part in this way, St. John? And when you go to India, will you leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now turned quite from the moon and faced me. '' When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!
<p/>What! do you not go to India?'' '' You said I could not unless I married you.'' '' And you will not marry me!
<p/>You adhere to that resolution? '' Reader, do you know, as I do, what terror those cold people can put into the ice of their questions?
<p/>How much of the fall of the avalanche is in their anger? of the breaking up of the frozen sea in their displeasure?
<p/>'' No. St. John, I will not marry you. I adhere to my resolution. '' The avalanche had shaken and slid a little forward, but it did not yet crash down.
<p/>'' Once more, why this refusal? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked. '' Formerly,'' I answered, <div class="bookquote">``because you did not love me; now, I reply, because you almost hate me.
<p/>If I were to marry you, you would kill me. You are killing me now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lips and cheeks turned white--quite white.
<p/>'' I should kill you -- I am killing you ? Your words are such as ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.
<p/>They betray an unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fellow even until seventy-and-seven times.
<p/>While earnestly wishing to erase from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind the trace of my former offence, I had stamped on that tenacious surface another and far deeper impression, I had burnt it in.
<p/>'' I had finished the business now. '' Now you will indeed hate me,'' I said. '' It is useless to attempt to conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.
<p/>'' A fresh wrong did these words inflict: the worse, because they touched on the truth. That bloodless lip quivered to a temporary spasm.
<p/>You utterly misinterpret my words,'' I said, at once seizing his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) hand: <div class="bookquote">``I have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not.
<p/>I knew the steely ire I had whetted. I was heart-wrung. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' Most bitterly he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) smiled--most decidedly he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) hand from mine.
<p/>'' And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume? '' said he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>), after a considerable pause.
<p/>What struggle there was in him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) between Nature and Grace in this interval, I cannot tell: only singular gleams scintillated in his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) eyes, and strange shadows passed over his (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) face.
<p/>I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.
<p/>I proved it to you in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever again alluding to the plan.
<p/>'' Yes, I will, as your assistant,'' I answered. A very long silence succeeded. He (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>) spoke at last. '' That you have done so
<p/>, I regret--for your sake. '' I interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>assistant</b></font>). Anything like a tangible reproach gave me courage at once. '' Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.
<p/>You are not really shocked: for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.
<p/>You pretend to be shocked by what I have said. I say again, I will be your curate, if you like, but never your wife.
<p/>'' Again he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) turned lividly pale; but, as before, controlled his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) passion perfectly. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) answered emphatically but calmly-- <div class="bookquote">``A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.
<p/>With me, then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor.
<p/>Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your promise and deserting the band you engaged to join.
<p/>Now I never had, as the reader knows, either given any formal promise or entered into any engagement; and this language was all much too hard and much too despotic for the occasion.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>I replied-- '' There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case. I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with strangers.
<p/>With you I would have ventured much, because I admire, confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate.''
<p/>God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide.
<p/>Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by some means that doubt is removed.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Ah! you are afraid of yourself,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said, curling his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lip. '' I am. '' What do you mean?'' <div class="bookquote">``I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.
<p/>The interest you cherish is lawless and unconsecrated. Long since you ought to have crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.
<p/>You think of Mr. Rochester? ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was true. I confessed it by silence. '' Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It remains for me, then,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said, ``to remember you in my prayers, and to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed become a castaway.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I must find out what is become of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen. But God sees not as man sees: His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will be done--
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) opened the gate, passed through it, and strayed away down the glen. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was soon out of sight. On re-entering the parlour, I found Diana standing at the window, looking very thoughtful.
<p/>Diana was a great deal taller than I: she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hand on my shoulder, and, stooping, examined my face. ''
<p/>Jane,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``you are always agitated and pale now. I am sure there is something the matter. Tell me what business St. John
<p/>I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly know what.
<p/>and you have on hands. St. John is a strange being-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) paused-- I did not speak: soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) resumed-- <div class="bookquote">``That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting you
<p/>, I am sure: he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never showed to any one else--to what end?
<p/>I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) loved you--does he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), Jane? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I put her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cool hand to my hot forehead; <div class="bookquote">``No, Die, not one whit.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Then why does he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) follow you so with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and keep you so continually at his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) side?
<p/>'' Mary and I had both concluded he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wished you to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).'' '' He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does--he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has asked me to be his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife.
<p/>'' Diana clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) hands. '' That is just what we hoped and thought! And you will marry him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), Jane, won't you?
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Far from that, Diana; his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a fitting fellow-labourer in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) Indian toils.
<p/>And then he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will stay in England.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' <div class="bookquote">``What! He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wishes you to go to India?''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Yes.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Madness!''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) exclaimed. ''
<p/>You would not live three months there, I am certain. You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I have refused to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)--''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``And have consequently displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)? ''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) suggested. '' Deeply: he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister.''
<p/>'' It was frantic folly to do so, Jane. Think of the task you undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak.
<p/>St. John--you know him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--would urge you to impossibilities: with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) there would be no permission to rest during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) exacts, you force yourself to perform.
<p/>I am astonished you found courage to refuse his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand. You do not love him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) then, Jane?'' '' Not as a husband.''
<p/>'' Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is a handsome fellow.'' '' And I am so plain, you see, Die. We should never suit.'' <div class="bookquote">``Plain!
<p/>You? Not at all. You are much too pretty, as well as too good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I must indeed,'' I said; <div class="bookquote">``for when just now I repeated the offer of serving him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) for a deacon, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) expressed himself shocked at my want of decency.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find in him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a brother, and habitually regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as such.
<p/>And again she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) earnestly conjured me to give up all thoughts of going out with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brother. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' What makes you say he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does not love you, Jane?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You should hear himself on the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has again and again explained that it is not himself, but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) office he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wishes to mate.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no doubt. But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that I am not formed for marriage.
<p/>Would it not be strange, Die, to be chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>And then,'' I continued, ``though I have only sisterly affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) now, yet, if forced to be his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, I can imagine the possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) look, manner, and conversation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not want me to love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and if I showed the feeling, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would make me sensible that it was a superfluity, unrequired by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), unbecoming in me.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' In that case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would.'' '' And yet St. John is a good man,'' said Diana.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is a good and a great man; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own large views.
<p/>It is better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) way, lest, in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) progress, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) should trample them down.
<p/>'' Here he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) comes! I will leave you, Diana. '' And I hastened upstairs as I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entering the garden.
<p/>I had thought he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would hardly speak to me, and I was certain he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had given up the pursuit of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) matrimonial scheme
<p/>But I was forced to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) again at supper. During that meal he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) appeared just as composed as usual. : the sequel showed I was mistaken on both points.
<p/>No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had invoked the help of the Holy Spirit to subdue the anger I had roused in him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and now believed he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had forgiven me once more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) addressed me precisely in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ordinary manner, or what had, of late, been his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ordinary manner--one scrupulously polite. For the evening reading before prayers, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) selected the twenty-first chapter of Revelation.
<p/>It was at all times pleasant to listen while from his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lips fell the words of the Bible: never did his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) fine voice sound at once so sweet and full--never did his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) manner become so impressive in its noble simplicity, as when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) delivered the oracles of God: and to-night that voice took a more solemn tone--that manner a more thrilling meaning--as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sat in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) household circle -LRB-the May moon shining in through the uncurtained window, and rendering almost unnecessary the light of the candle on the table-RRB-: as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sat there, bending over the great old Bible, and described from its page the vision of the new heaven and the new earth--told how God would come to dwell with men, how He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) would wipe away all tears from their eyes, and promised that there should be no more death, neither sorrow nor crying, nor any more pain, because the former things were passed away.
<p/>The succeeding words thrilled me strangely as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke them: especially as I felt, by the slight, indescribable alteration in sound, that in uttering them, his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) eye had turned on me.
<p/>But,'' was slowly, distinctly read, <div class="bookquote">``the fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) God, and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) shall be my son. ''
<p/>Henceforward, I knew what fate St. John feared for me. A calm, subdued triumph, blent with a longing earnestness, marked his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) enunciation of the last glorious verses of that chapter.
<p/>The reader believed his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) name was already written in the Lamb's book of life, and he (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) yearned after the hour which should admit him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) to the city to which the kings of the earth bring their glory and honour; which has no need of sun or moon to shine in it, because the glory of God lightens it, and the Lamb is the light thereof.
<p/>In the prayer following the chapter, all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) energy gathered--all his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) stern zeal woke: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) was in deep earnest, wrestling with God, and resolved on a conquest.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) supplicated strength for the weak-hearted; guidance for wanderers from the fold: a return, even at the eleventh hour, for those whom the temptations of the world and the flesh were luring from the narrow path.
<p/>Earnestness is ever deeply solemn: first, as I listened to that prayer, I wondered at his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); then, when it continued and rose, I was touched by it, and at last awed.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) felt the greatness and goodness of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) purpose so sincerely: others who heard him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) plead for it, could not but feel it too.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) asked, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) urged, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) claimed the boon of a brand snatched from the burning. The prayer over, we took leave of him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was to go at a very early hour in the morning.
<p/>Diana and Mary having kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), left the room--in compliance, I think, with a whispered hint from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>): I tendered my hand, and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) a pleasant journey.
<p/>'' Thank you, Jane. As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.
<p/>If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do all things to the glory of God.
<p/>My Master was long-suffering: so will I be. I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath: repent--resolve, while there is yet time.
<p/>Remember, we are bid to work while it is day--warned that `the night cometh when no man shall work.' Remember the fate of Dives, who had his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) good things in this life.
<p/>God give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) laid his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand on my head as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) uttered the last words.
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) look was not, indeed, that of a lover beholding his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mistress, but it was that of a pastor recalling his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) wandering sheep--or better, of a guardian angel watching the soul for which he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is responsible.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had spoken earnestly, mildly: All men of talent, whether they be men of feeling or not; whether they be zealots, or aspirants, or despots--provided only they be sincere--have their sublime moments, when they subdue and rule.
<p/>I felt veneration for St. John--veneration so strong that its impetus thrust me at once to the point I had so long shunned.
<p/>I was tempted to cease struggling with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)--to rush down the torrent of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) will into the gulf of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) existence, and there lose my own.
<p/>I was almost as hard beset by him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now as I had been once before, in a different way, by another.
<p/>To have yielded then would have been an error of principle; to have yielded now would have been an error of judgment.
<p/>So I think at this hour, when I look back to the crisis through the quiet medium of time: I was unconscious of folly at the instant.
<p/>I was a fool both times. I stood motionless under my hierophant's touch. My refusals were forgotten--my fears overcome--my wrestlings paralysed.
<p/>The Impossible-- i.e. , my marriage with St. John-- was fast becoming the Possible. All was changing utterly with a sudden sweep.
<p/>Religion called--Angels beckoned--God commanded--life rolled together like a scroll--death's gates opening, showed eternity beyond: it seemed, that for safety and bliss there, all here might be sacrificed in a second.
<p/>The dim room was full of visions. '' Could you decide now?'' asked the missionary. The inquiry was put in gentle tones: he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) drew me to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as gently.
<p/>Oh, that gentleness! how far more potent is it than force! I could resist St. John's wrath: I grew pliant as a reed under his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) kindness.
<p/>Yet I knew all the time, if I yielded now, I should not the less be made to repent, some day, of my former rebellion.
<p/>I could decide if I were but certain,'' I answered: <div class="bookquote">``were I but convinced that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here and now--come afterwards what would!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) nature was not changed by one hour of solemn prayer: it was only elevated. '' '' My prayers are heard!'' ejaculated St. John.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hand firmer on my head, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) claimed me: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) surrounded me with his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arm, almost as if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) loved me -LRB-I say almost --I knew the difference--for I had felt what it was to be loved; but, like him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), I had now put love out of the question, and thought only of duty-RRB-.
<p/>I contended with my inward dimness of vision, before which clouds yet rolled. I sincerely, deeply, fervently longed to do what was right; and only that.
<p/>I was excited more than I had ever been; and whether what followed was the effect of excitement the reader shall judge.
<p/>'' Show me, show me the path! '' I entreated of Heaven. All the house was still; for I believe all, except St. John and myself, were now retired to rest.
<p/>The one candle was dying out: the room was full of moonlight. My heart beat fast and thick: I heard its throb.
<p/>Suddenly it stood still to an inexpressible feeling that thrilled it through, and passed at once to my head and extremities.
<p/>The feeling was not like an electric shock, but it was quite as sharp, as strange, as startling: it acted on my senses as if their utmost activity hitherto had been but torpor, from which they were now summoned and forced to wake.
<p/>They rose expectant: eye and ear waited while the flesh quivered on my bones. '' What have you heard? What do you see?'' asked St. John.
<p/>I saw nothing, but I heard a voice somewhere cry-- <div class="bookquote">``Jane! Jane! Jane!'' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>--nothing more. '' O God! what is it? ''
<p/>'' for it did not seem in the room--nor in the house--nor in the garden; it did not come out of the air--nor from under the earth--nor from overhead.
<p/>And it was the voice of a human being--a known, loved, well-remembered voice--that of Edward Fairfax Rochester; and it spoke in pain and woe, wildly, eerily, urgently.
<p/>I gasped. I might have said, <div class="bookquote">``Where is it? I had heard it--where, or whence, for ever impossible to know! ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I am coming! '' I cried. '' Wait for me! Oh, I will come! '' I flew to the door and looked into the passage: it was dark.
<p/>I ran out into the garden: it was void. '' Where are you? '' I exclaimed. The hills beyond Marsh Glen sent the answer faintly back--<div class="bookquote">``Where are you?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>Glen</b></font>)</div>I listened. The wind sighed low in the firs: all was moorland loneliness and midnight hush. '' Down superstition! ''
<p/>I commented, as that spectre rose up black by the black yew at the gate. '' This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft: it is the work of nature.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was roused, and did--no miracle--but her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) best. '' I broke from St. John, who had followed, and would have detained me.
<p/>It was my time to assume ascendency. My powers were in play and in force. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to forbear question or remark; I desired him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to leave me: I must and would be alone.
<p/>I mounted to my chamber; locked myself in; fell on my knees; and prayed in my way--a different way to St. John's, but effective in its own fashion.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) obeyed at once. Where there is energy to command well enough, obedience never fails. I seemed to penetrate very near a Mighty Spirit; and my soul rushed out in gratitude at His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) feet.
<p/>I rose from the thanksgiving--took a resolve--and lay down, unscared, enlightened--eager but for the daylight. CHAPTER XXXVI The daylight came. I rose at dawn.
<p/>I busied myself for an hour or two with arranging my things in my chamber, drawers, and wardrobe, in the order wherein I should wish to leave them during a brief absence.
<p/>Meantime, I heard St. John quit his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) room. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stopped at my door: I feared he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would knock--no, but a slip of paper was passed under the door.
<p/>Had you stayed but a little longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the angel's crown.
<p/>I took it up. It bore these words-- <div class="bookquote">``You left me too suddenly last night. I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day fortnight.
<p/>Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.
<p/>My spirit,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered mentally, <div class="bookquote">``is willing to do what is right; and my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when once that will is distinctly known to me.
<p/>At any rate, it shall be strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of doubt, and find the open day of certainty.
<p/>I shall pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' '' It was the first of June; yet the morning was overcast and chilly: rain beat fast on my casement.
<p/>I heard the front-door open, and St. John pass out. Looking through the window, I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) traverse the garden. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took the way over the misty moors in the direction of Whitcross--there he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would meet the coach.
<p/>In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,'' thought I: <div class="bookquote">``I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I too have some to see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever. '' It wanted yet two hours of breakfast-time.
<p/>I filled the interval in walking softly about my room, and pondering the visitation which had given my plans their present bent.
<p/>I recalled the voice I had heard; again I questioned whence it came, as vainly as before: it seemed in me --not in the external world.
<p/>I recalled that inward sensation I had experienced: for I could recall it, with all its unspeakable strangeness. I asked was it a mere nervous impression--a delusion?
<p/>The wondrous shock of feeling had come like the earthquake which shook the foundations of Paul and Silas's prison; it had opened the doors of the soul's cell and loosed its bands--it had wakened it out of its sleep, whence it sprang trembling, listening, aghast; then vibrated thrice a cry on my startled ear, and in my quaking heart and through my spirit, which neither feared nor shook, but exulted as if in joy over the success of one effort it had been privileged to make, independent of the cumbrous body.
<p/>Ere many days,'' I said, as I terminated my musings, <div class="bookquote">``I will know something of him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) whose voice seemed last night to summon me.
<p/>I could not conceive or believe: it was more like an inspiration. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Letters have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them.
<p/>At breakfast I announced to Diana and Mary that I was going a journey, and should be absent at least four days.
<p/>'' '' Alone, Jane? '' they asked. '' Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some time been uneasy.
<p/>They might have said, as I have no doubt they thought, that they had believed me to be without any friends save them: for, indeed, I had often said so; but, with their true natural delicacy, they abstained from comment, except that Diana asked me if I was sure I was well enough to travel.
<p/>'' I looked very pale, she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) observed. I replied, that nothing ailed me save anxiety of mind, which I hoped soon to alleviate.
<p/>Having once explained to them that I could not now be explicit about my plans, they kindly and wisely acquiesced in the silence with which I pursued them, according to me the privilege of free action I should under similar circumstances have accorded them.
<p/>I left Moor House at three o'clock p.m., and soon after four I stood at the foot of the sign-post of Whitcross, waiting the arrival of the coach which was to take me to distant Thornfield.
<p/>It was easy to make my further arrangements; for I was troubled with no inquiries--no surmises. Amidst the silence of those solitary roads and desert hills, I heard it approach from a great distance.
<p/>It was the same vehicle whence, a year ago, I had alighted one summer evening on this very spot--how desolate, and hopeless, and objectless!
<p/>It stopped as I beckoned. I entered--not now obliged to part with my whole fortune as the price of its accommodation.
<p/>Once more on the road to Thornfield, I felt like the messenger-pigeon flying home. It was a journey of six-and-thirty hours.
<p/>I had set out from Whitcross on a Tuesday afternoon, and early on the succeeding Thursday morning the coach stopped to water the horses at a wayside inn, situated in the midst of scenery whose green hedges and large fields and low pastoral hills -LRB-how mild of feature and verdant of hue compared with the stern North- Midland moors of Morton!-RRB-
<p/>met my eye like the lineaments of a once familiar face. Yes, I knew the character of this landscape: I was sure we were near my bourne.
<p/>'' How far is Thornfield Hall from here? '' I asked of the ostler. '' Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields.
<p/>I got out of the coach, gave a box I had into the ostler's charge, to be kept till I called for it; paid my fare; satisfied the coachman, and was going: the brightening day gleamed on the sign of the inn, and I read in gilt letters, <div class="bookquote">``The Rochester Arms.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' My journey is closed,'' I thought to myself. '' My heart leapt up: I was already on my master's very lands.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you know: and then, if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten, who besides him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is there?
<p/>It fell again: the thought struck it:-- His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>): you dare not speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) or seek his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) presence.
<p/>Ask information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek: they can solve your doubts at once.
<p/>You have lost your labour--you had better go no farther,''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>urged the monitor. '' Go up to that man, and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home.
<p/>'' The suggestion was sensible, and yet I could not force myself to act on it. I so dreaded a reply that would crush me with despair.
<p/>To prolong doubt was to prolong hope. I might yet once more see the Hall under the ray of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) star.
<p/>There was the stile before me--the very fields through which I had hurried, blind, deaf, distracted with a revengeful fury tracking and scourging me, on the morning I fled from Thornfield: ere
<p/>I well knew what course I had resolved to take, I was in the midst of them. How fast I walked!
<p/>How I ran sometimes! How I looked forward to catch the first view of the well-known woods! With what feelings I welcomed single trees I knew, and familiar glimpses of meadow and hill between them!
<p/>At last the woods rose; the rookery clustered dark; a loud cawing broke the morning stillness. Strange delight inspired me: on I hastened.
<p/>My first view of it shall be in front,'' I determined, <div class="bookquote">``where its bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out my master's very window: perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will be standing at it--he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) rises early: perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in front.
<p/>Another field crossed--a lane threaded--and there were the courtyard walls--the back offices: the house itself, the rookery still hid. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Could I but see him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)!--but a moment!
<p/>Surely, in that case, I should not be so mad as to run to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)? I cannot tell--I am not certain.
<p/>And if I did--what then? God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)! What then? Who would be hurt by my once more tasting the life his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) glance can give me?
<p/>I rave: perhaps at this moment he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south.
<p/>I had coasted along the lower wall of the orchard--turned its angle: there was a gate just there, opening into the meadow, between two stone pillars crowned by stone balls.
<p/>I advanced my head with precaution, desirous to ascertain if any bedroom window-blinds were yet drawn up: battlements, windows, long front--all from this sheltered station were at my command.
<p/>'' From behind one pillar I could peep round quietly at the full front of the mansion. The crows sailing overhead perhaps watched me while I took this survey.
<p/>They must have considered I was very careful and timid at first, and that gradually I grew very bold and reckless.
<p/>A peep, and then a long stare; and then a departure from my niche and a straying out into the meadow; and a sudden stop full in front of the great mansion, and a protracted, hardy gaze towards it.
<p/>I wonder what they thought. '' What affectation of diffidence was this at first? '' they might have demanded; <div class="bookquote">``what stupid regardlessness now?
<p/>A lover finds his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) mistress asleep on a mossy bank; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) wishes to catch a glimpse of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) fair face without waking her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>).
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) steals softly over the grass, careful to make no sound; he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) pauses--fancying she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) has stirred: he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) withdraws: not for worlds would he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) be seen.
<p/>All is still: he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) again advances: he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) bends above her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>); a light veil rests on her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) features: he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) lifts it, bends lower; now his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eyes anticipate the vision of beauty--warm, and blooming, and lovely, in rest.
<p/>How he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) suddenly and vehemently clasps in both arms the form he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) dared not, a moment since, touch with his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) finger!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>reader</b></font>)</div>Hear an illustration, reader. How hurried was their first glance! But how they fix! How he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) starts! How he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) calls aloud a name, and drops his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) burden, and gazes on it wildly!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) thus grasps and cries, and gazes, because he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) no longer fears to waken by any sound he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) can utter--by any movement he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) can make.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) love slept sweetly: he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) finds she (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) is stone dead. I looked with timorous joy towards a stately house: I saw a blackened ruin.
<p/>No need to cower behind a gate-post, indeed!--to peep up at chamber lattices, fearing life was astir behind them! No need to listen for doors opening--to fancy steps on the pavement or the gravel-walk!
<p/>The front was, as I had once seen it in a dream, but a well-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking, perforated with paneless windows: no roof, no battlements, no chimneys--all had crashed in.
<p/>The lawn, the grounds were trodden and waste: the portal yawned void. And there was the silence of death about it:
<p/>No wonder that letters addressed to people here had never received an answer: as well despatch epistles to a vault in a church aisle.
<p/>the solitude of a lonesome wild. The grim blackness of the stones told by what fate the Hall had fallen--by conflagration: but how kindled?
<p/>What story belonged to this disaster? What loss, besides mortar and marble and wood-work had followed upon it? Had life been wrecked as well as property?
<p/>In wandering round the shattered walls and through the devastated interior, I gathered evidence that the calamity was not of late occurrence.
<p/>Winter snows, I thought, had drifted through that void arch, winter rains beaten in at those hollow casements; for, amidst the drenched piles of rubbish, spring had cherished vegetation: grass and weed grew here and there between the stones and fallen rafters.
<p/>If so, whose? Dreadful question: there was no one here to answer it--not even dumb sign, mute token. And oh! where meantime was the hapless owner of this wreck?
<p/>My eye involuntarily wandered to the grey church tower near the gates, and I asked, <div class="bookquote">``Is he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) with Damer de Rochester, sharing the shelter of his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) narrow marble house?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>In what land? Under what auspices? Some answer must be had to these questions. I could find it nowhere but at the inn, and thither, ere long, I returned.
<p/>The host himself brought my breakfast into the parlour. I requested him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) to shut the door and sit down: I had some questions to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>).
<p/>But when he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) complied, I scarcely knew how to begin; such horror had I of the possible answers. And yet the spectacle of desolation I had just left prepared me in a measure for a tale of misery.
<p/>The host was a respectable-looking, middle-aged man. '' You know Thornfield Hall, of course? '' I managed to say at last.
<p/>'' Yes, ma'am; I lived there once.'' <div class="bookquote">``Did you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Not in my time, I thought: you are a stranger to me.
<p/>'' I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) added. The late! I seem to have received, with full force, the blow I had been trying to evade.
<p/>'' The late! '' I gasped. '' Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) dead?'' '' I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) explained.
<p/>Fully assured by these words that Mr. Edward-- my Mr. Rochester -LRB-God bless him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was!-RRB---was at least alive: was, in short, <div class="bookquote">``the present gentleman.
<p/>I breathed again: my blood resumed its flow. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Gladdening words! It seemed I could hear all that was to come--whatever the disclosures might be--with comparative tranquillity.
<p/>Since he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not in the grave, I could bear, I thought, to learn that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was at the Antipodes. ''
<p/>I asked, knowing, of course, what the answer would be, but yet desirous of deferring the direct question as to where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) really was.
<p/>I suppose you are a stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about harvest-time.
<p/>Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now? '' '' No, ma'am--oh, no! No one is living there. A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.
<p/>The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame.
<p/>It was a terrible spectacle: I witnessed it myself.'' <div class="bookquote">``At dead of night! ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I muttered. Yes, that was ever the hour of fatality at Thornfield.
<p/>'' Was it known how it originated? '' I demanded. '' They guessed, ma'am: they guessed. Indeed, I should say it was ascertained beyond a doubt.
<p/>You are not perhaps aware,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) continued, edging his (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) chair a little nearer the table, and speaking low, <div class="bookquote">``that there was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I have heard something of it. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some years was not absolutely certain of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) existence.
<p/>No one saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>): they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was it was difficult to conjecture.
<p/>They said Mr. Edward had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from abroad, and some believed she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mistress. But a queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I feared now to hear my own story. I endeavoured to recall him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to the main fact. '' And this lady?''
<p/>'' This lady, ma'am,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">``turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.
<p/>There was a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in-- ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``But the fire,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suggested.
<p/>'' I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with. The servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) continually.
<p/>They used to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)--servants will, you know, ma'am--and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) set store on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) past everything: for all, nobody but him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) so very handsome.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was a little small thing, they say, almost like a child. I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) myself; but I've heard Leah, the house-maid, tell of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>).
<p/>Mr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were bewitched.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``You shall tell me this part of the story another time,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said; <div class="bookquote">``but now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.
<p/>Leah liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) well enough. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) would marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>).''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?''
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) had a woman to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) called Mrs. Poole--an able woman in her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) line, and very trustworthy, but for one fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) kept a private bottle of gin by her (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) , and now and then took a drop over-much.
<p/>It is excusable, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Leah</b></font>) had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) pocket, let herself out of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) head.
<p/>'' You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>), and nobody but her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>), that set it going. They say she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) had nearly burnt her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) husband in his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bed once: but I don't know about that.
<p/>However, on this night, she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) set fire first to the hangings of the room next her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) own, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) got down to a lower storey, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) way to the chamber that had been the governess's---LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)
<p/>was like as if she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>)-RRB---and she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.
<p/>The governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester sought her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) as if she (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>) had been the most precious thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had in the world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) never could hear a word of her (<font color='blue'><b>witch</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) grew savage--quite savage on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) disappointment
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) friends at a distance; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did it handsomely, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) settled an annuity on her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) for life: and she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) deserved it
<p/>: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) never was a wild man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) got dangerous after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) lost her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be alone, too. --she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was a very good woman.
<p/>Miss Adele, a ward he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, was put to school. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not cross the door-stones of the house, except at night, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the orchard as if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses--which it is my opinion he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was before that midge of a governess crossed him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), you never saw, ma'am.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was not so very handsome; but he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had a courage and a will of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own, if ever man had.
<p/>I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) came to Thornfield Hall.''

<p/>Yes, indeed was he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) went up to the attics when all was burning above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself, and went back to get his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) mad wife out of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) cell.
<p/>And then they called out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was on the roof, where she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was standing, waving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till they could hear her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a mile off: I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with my own eyes.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming against the flames as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) stood.

(<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise.''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>'' CHAPTER XXXVII I had heard of it before.
<p/>Mr. Rochester often spoke of it, and sometimes went there. His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) father had purchased the estate for the sake of the game covers.
<p/>Ferndean then remained uninhabited and unfurnished, with the exception of some two or three rooms fitted up for the accommodation of the squire when he (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) went there in the season to shoot.
<p/>To this house I came just ere dark on an evening marked by the characteristics of sad sky, cold gale, and continued small penetrating rain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>squire</b></font>) would have let the house, but could find no tenant, in consequence of its ineligible and insalubrious site. The last mile I performed on foot, having dismissed the chaise and driver with the double remuneration I had promised.
<p/>Even when within a very short distance of the manor-house, you could see nothing of it, so thick and dark grew the timber of the gloomy wood about it.
<p/>Iron gates between granite pillars showed me where to enter, and passing through them, I found myself at once in the twilight of close-ranked trees.
<p/>There was a grass-grown track descending the forest aisle between hoar and knotty shafts and under branched arches. I followed it, expecting soon to reach the dwelling; but it stretched on and on, it wound far and farther:
<p/>no sign of habitation or grounds was visible. I thought I had taken a wrong direction and lost my way. The darkness of natural as well as of sylvan dusk gathered over me.
<p/>I looked round in search of another road. There was none: all was interwoven stem, columnar trunk, dense summer foliage--no opening anywhere.
<p/>I proceeded: at last my way opened, the trees thinned a little; presently I beheld a railing, then the house--scarce, by this dim light, distinguishable from the trees; so dank and green were its decaying walls.
<p/>Entering a portal, fastened only by a latch, I stood amidst a space of enclosed ground, from which the wood swept away in a semicircle.
<p/>There were no flowers, no garden-beds; only a broad gravel-walk girdling a grass-plat, and this set in the heavy frame of the forest.
<p/>The house presented two pointed gables in its front; the windows were latticed and narrow: the front door was narrow too, one step led up to it.
<p/>It was as still as a church on a week-day: the pattering rain on the forest leaves was the only sound audible in its vicinage.
<p/>The whole looked, as the host of the Rochester Arms had said, <div class="bookquote">``quite a desolate spot. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>'' Can there be life here?
<p/>'' I asked. Yes, life of some kind there was; for I heard a movement--that narrow front-door was unclosing, and some shape was about to issue from the grange.
<p/>It opened slowly: a figure came out into the twilight and stood on the step; a man without a hat: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stretched forth his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand as if to feel whether it rained.
<p/>Dusk as it was , I had recognised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)--it was my master, Edward Fairfax Rochester, and no other. I stayed my step, almost my breath, and stood to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)--to examine him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>), myself unseen, and alas!
<p/>to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) invisible. It was a sudden meeting, and one in which rapture was kept well in check by pain. I had no difficulty in restraining my voice from exclamation, my step from hasty advance.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) form was of the same strong and stalwart contour as ever: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) port was still erect, his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hair was still raven black; nor were his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) features altered or sunk: not in one year's space, by any sorrow, could his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) athletic strength be quelled or his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) vigorous prime blighted.
<p/>But in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) countenance I saw a change: that looked desperate and brooding--that reminded me of some wronged and fettered wild beast or bird, dangerous to approach in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) sullen woe.
<p/>The caged eagle, whose gold-ringed eyes cruelty has extinguished, might look as looked that sightless Samson. And, reader, do you think I feared him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) blind ferocity?--if
<p/>A soft hope blest with my sorrow that soon I should dare to drop a kiss on that brow of rock, and on those lips so sternly sealed beneath it: but not yet.
<p/>you do, you little know me. I would not accost him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) descended the one step, and advanced slowly and gropingly towards the grass-plat.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) lifted his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) hand and opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) eyelids; gazed blank, and with a straining effort, on the sky, and toward the amphitheatre of trees: one saw that all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) was void darkness.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) right hand -LRB-the left arm, the mutilated one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) kept hidden in his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) bosom-RRB-; he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) seemed to wish by touch to gain an idea of what lay around him (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) met but vacancy still; for the trees were some yards off where he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) stood.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) relinquished the endeavour, folded his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) arms, and stood quiet and mute in the rain, now falling fast on his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) uncovered head.
<p/>Where was his (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) daring stride now? Then he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) paused, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Samson</b></font>) knew not which way to turn. At this moment John approached him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) from some quarter.
<p/>'' Will you take my arm, sir? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said; <div class="bookquote">``there is a heavy shower coming on: had you not better go in?''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``Let me alone,''  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Reed/Reed</b></font>)</div>was the answer. John withdrew without having observed me. Mr. Rochester now tried to walk about: vainly,--all was too uncertain.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) groped his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) way back to the house, and, re-entering it, closed the door. I now drew near and knocked: John's wife opened for me.
<p/>'' Mary,'' I said, <div class="bookquote">``how are you?''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) started as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen a ghost: I calmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>). To her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hurried <div class="bookquote">``Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered by taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand; and then I followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) into the kitchen, where John now sat by a good fire.
<p/>I explained to them, in few words, that I had heard all which had happened since I left Thornfield, and that I was come to see Mr. Rochester.
<p/>I asked John to go down to the turn- pike-house, where I had dismissed the chaise, and bring my trunk, which I had left there: and then, while I removed my bonnet and shawl, I questioned Mary as to whether I could be accommodated at the Manor House for the night; and finding that arrangements to that effect, though difficult, would not be impossible, I informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) I should stay.
<p/>When you go in,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``tell your master that a person wishes to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), but do not give my name.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Just at this moment the parlour-bell rang. '' <div class="bookquote">``I don't think he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will see you,''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) answered; <div class="bookquote">``he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) refuses everybody. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) returned, I inquired what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) had said. '' You are to send in your name and your business,'' she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) replied.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) then proceeded to fill a glass with water, and place it on a tray, together with candles. '' Is that what he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) rang for?
<p/>'' I asked. '' Yes: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) always has candles brought in at dark, though he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is blind.'' <div class="bookquote">``Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.
<p/>The tray shook as I held it; the water spilt from the glass; my heart struck my ribs loud and fast.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hand: she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pointed me out the parlour door. Mary opened the door for me, and shut it behind me.
<p/>This parlour looked gloomy: a neglected handful of fire burnt low in the grate; and, leaning over it, with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) head supported against the high, old-fashioned mantelpiece, appeared the blind tenant of the room.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) old dog, Pilot, lay on one side, removed out of the way, and coiled up as if afraid of being inadvertently trodden upon.
<p/>Pilot pricked up his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ears when I came in: then he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) jumped up with a yelp and a whine, and bounded towards me: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) almost knocked the tray from my hands.
<p/>I set it on the table; then patted him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), and said softly, <div class="bookquote">``Lie down!''  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Mr. Rochester turned mechanically to see what the commotion was: but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) saw nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) returned and sighed.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Give me the water, Mary,''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) said. I approached him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) with the now only half-filled glass; Pilot followed me, still excited.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) checked the water on its way to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) lips, and seemed to listen: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) drank, and put the glass down.
<p/>'' What is the matter? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) inquired. '' Down, Pilot!'' I again said. '' This is you, Mary, is it not?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary is in the kitchen,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) put out his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hand with a quick gesture, but not seeing where I stood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) did not touch me.
<p/>'' Who is this? Who is this? '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) demanded, trying, as it seemed, to see with those sightless eyes--unavailing and distressing attempt! ''
<p/>Answer me--speak again! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) ordered, imperiously and aloud. '' Will you have a little more water, sir? I spilt half of what was in the glass,'' I said.
<p/>'' Who is it? What is it? Who speaks?'' <div class="bookquote">``Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here. I came only this evening,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I answered.
<p/>'' Great God!--what delusion has come over me? What sweet madness has seized me?'' <div class="bookquote">``No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion, your health too sound for frenzy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>the speaker</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And where is the speaker? Is it only a voice? Oh! I cannot see, but I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.
<p/>Whatever--whoever you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!'' He (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) groped; I arrested his (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) wandering hand, and prisoned it in both mine.

<p/>Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into it.--What, Janet!
<p/>If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want company of an evening.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like me?''
<p/>Are you an independent woman? A rich woman?'' '' '' <div class="bookquote">``I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own mistress.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and hands to you.
<p/>'' And you will stay with me?'' '' Certainly--unless you object. I will be your neighbour, your nurse, your housekeeper. Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not be left desolate, so long as I live.
<p/>'' He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) replied not: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) seemed serious--abstracted; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sighed; he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) half-opened his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) lips as if to speak: he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) closed them again.
<p/>I felt a little embarrassed. Perhaps I had too rashly over-leaped conventionalities; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>), like St. John, saw impropriety in my inconsiderateness.
<p/>an expectation, not the less certain because unexpressed, had buoyed me up, that he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would claim me at once as his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) own.
<p/>But no hint to that effect escaping him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) countenance becoming more overcast, I suddenly remembered that I might have been all wrong, and was perhaps playing the fool unwittingly; and I began gently to withdraw myself from his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) arms--but he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) eagerly snatched me closer.
<p/>I had indeed made my proposal from the idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wished and would ask me to be his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wife: ''
<p/>No--no --Jane; you must not go. No--I have touched you, heard you, felt the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation:
<p/>I cannot give up these joys. I have little left in myself--I must have you. The world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.
<p/>My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame. '' '' Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.
<p/>You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse -LRB-for you have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity-RRB-, and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.
<p/>'' '' Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand another. I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so?
<p/>Come--tell me.'' <div class="bookquote">``I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if you think it better.''
 (<font color='red'><b>nurse Janet</b></font>)</div><p/>'' But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry one day.'' <div class="bookquote">``I don't care about being married.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make you care--but--a sightless block!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I, on the contrary, became more cheerful, and took fresh courage: these last words gave me an insight as to where the difficulty lay; and as it was no difficulty with me, I felt quite relieved from my previous embarrassment.
<p/>It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,'' said I, parting his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) thick and long uncut locks; <div class="bookquote">``for I see you are being metamorphosed into a lion, or something of that sort.
<p/>You have a `faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles' feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have not yet noticed.''

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Nebuchadnezzar</b></font>) relapsed again into gloom. I resumed a livelier vein of conversation. '' '' It is a mere stump--a ghastly sight!
<p/><div class="bookquote">``It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving you too well for all this; and making too much of you.''

<p/>'' And you see the candles?'' <div class="bookquote">``Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud.''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``Can you see me?''

<p/>My spirits were excited, and with pleasure and ease I talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) during supper, and for a long time after.
<p/>There was no harassing restraint, no repressing of glee and vivacity with him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>); for with him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) I was at perfect ease, because I knew I suited him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>); all I said or did seemed either to console or revive him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>).
<p/>'' Summoning Mary, I soon had the room in more cheerful order: I prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>), likewise, a comfortable repast. Delightful consciousness!
<p/>It brought to life and light my whole nature: in his (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) presence I thoroughly lived; and he (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) lived in mine. Blind as he (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) was, smiles played over his (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) face, joy dawned on his (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) forehead: his (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) lineaments softened and warmed.
<p/>After supper, he (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) began to ask me many questions, of where I had been, what I had been doing, how I had found him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) out; but I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) only very partial replies: it was too late to enter into particulars that night.
<p/>Besides, I wished to touch no deep-thrilling chord--to open no fresh well of emotion in his (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) heart: my sole present aim was to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>).
<p/>Cheered, as I have said, he (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) was: and yet but by fits. If a moment's silence broke the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>spirits</b></font>) would turn restless, touch me, then say, <div class="bookquote">``Jane.''

<p/>I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.
<p/>'' '' Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray.'' '' And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you.
<p/>Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day; feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.
<p/>Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past? Yes: for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) restoration I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.
<p/>How can it be that Jane is with me, and says she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) loves me? Will she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) not depart as suddenly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) came?
<p/>A commonplace, practical reply, out of the train of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) own disturbed ideas, was, I was sure, the best and most reassuring for him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) in this frame of mind.
<p/>I passed my finger over his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) eyebrows, and remarked that they were scorched, and that I would apply something which would make them grow as broad and black as ever.
<p/>Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when, at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow, whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards undiscoverable?
<p/>To-morrow, I fear I shall find her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) no more. '' '' '' Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?'' '' What for, Jane?''
<p/>I find you rather alarming, when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am sure

<p/>You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.
<p/>By the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham.''

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' There, sir, you are redd up and made decent. Now I'll leave you: I have been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.
<p/>Good night. '' <div class="bookquote">``Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have been? ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I laughed and made my escape, still laughing as I ran upstairs.
<p/>'' A good idea! '' I thought with glee. '' I see I have the means of fretting him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) out of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) melancholy for some time to come.
<p/>'' Very early the next morning I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) up and astir, wandering from one room to another. As soon as Mary came down I heard the question: <div class="bookquote">``Is Miss Eyre here?''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>Then: <div class="bookquote">``Which room did you put her (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) into? Was it dry? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) up? Go and ask if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) wants anything; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eyre</b></font>) will come down.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I came down as soon as I thought there was a prospect of breakfast. Entering the room very softly, I had a view of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) discovered my presence.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sat in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) chair--still, but not at rest: expectant evidently; the lines of now habitual sadness marking his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) strong features.
<p/>It was mournful, indeed, to witness the subjugation of that vigorous spirit to a corporeal infirmity. His (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) countenance reminded one of a lamp quenched, waiting to be re-lit--and alas!
<p/>it was not himself that could now kindle the lustre of animated expression: he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was dependent on another for that office!
<p/>I had meant to be gay and careless, but the powerlessness of the strong man touched my heart to the quick: still I accosted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with what vivacity I could.
<p/>'' It is a bright, sunny morning, sir,'' I said. '' The rain is over and gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk soon.
<p/>'' I had wakened the glow: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) features beamed. '' Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark! Come to me. You are not gone: not vanished?
<p/>I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun had rays.
<p/>All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to my ear -LRB-I am glad it is not naturally a silent one-RRB-: all the sunshine I can feel is in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) presence.
<p/>The water stood in my eyes to hear this avowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) dependence; just as if a royal eagle, chained to a perch, should be forced to entreat a sparrow to become its purveyor.
<p/>'' But I would not be lachrymose: I dashed off the salt drops, and busied myself with preparing breakfast. Most of the morning was spent in the open air.
<p/>I led him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) out of the wet and wild wood into some cheerful fields: I described to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) how brilliantly green they were; how the flowers and hedges looked refreshed; how sparklingly blue was the sky.
<p/>I sought a seat for him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) in a hidden and lovely spot, a dry stump of a tree; nor did I refuse to let him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), when seated, place me on his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) knee.
<p/>Why should I, when both he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) and I were happier near than apart? Pilot lay beside us: all was quiet. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) broke out suddenly while clasping me in his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) arms--
<p/>Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent!
<p/>you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Cruel, cruel deserter! A pearl necklace I had given What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless? And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) do?
<p/>I softened considerably what related to the three days of wandering and starvation, because to have told him (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) all would have been to inflict unnecessary pain: the little I did say lacerated his (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) faithful heart deeper than I wished.
<p/>I should not have left him (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) thus, he (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) said, without any means of making my way: I should have told him (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) my intention.
<p/>Let me hear now. ''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Thus urged, I began the narrative of my experience for the last year. I should have confided in him (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) would never have forced me to be his (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) mistress.
<p/>Violent as he (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) had seemed in his (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>) despair, he (<font color='blue'><b>deserter</b></font>), in truth, loved me far too well and too tenderly to constitute himself my tyrant: he (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) would have given me half his (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) fortune, without demanding so much as a kiss in return, rather than I should have flung myself friendless on the wide world.
<p/>Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short,'' I answered: and then I proceeded to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>tyrant</b></font>) how I had been received at Moor House; how I had obtained the office of schoolmistress, &
<p/>I had endured, he (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>) was certain, more than I had confessed to him (<font color='blue'><b>House</b></font>). '' c. The accession of fortune, the discovery of my relations, followed in due order.
<p/>Of course, St. John Rivers' name came in frequently in the progress of my tale. When I had done, that name was immediately taken up.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an iceberg.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) smiled. '' What, Jane! Is this true? Is such really the state of matters between you and Rivers?'' '' Absolutely, sir!
<p/>Oh, you need not be jealous! I wanted to tease you a little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief.
<p/>But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I do love you, you would be proud and content.
<p/>All my heart is yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence for ever.
<p/>'' Again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) kissed me, painful thoughts darkened his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) aspect. '' My seared vision! My crippled strength! '' he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) murmured regretfully.
<p/>I caressed, in order to soothe him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>). I knew of what he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was thinking, and wanted to speak for him (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), but dared not.
<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) turned aside his (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) face a minute, I saw a tear slide from under the sealed eyelid, and trickle down the manly cheek.
<p/>My heart swelled. '' I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield orchard,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) remarked ere long. ''

<p/>Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.
<p/>'' To be your wife is, for me, to be as happy as I can be on earth.'' '' Because you delight in sacrifice.
<p/>To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice?
<p/>'' <div class="bookquote">``Sacrifice! What do I sacrifice? Famine for food, expectation for content. If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice. ''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>I love you better now, when I can really be useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you disdained every part but that of the giver and protector.''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>'' Which are none, sir, to me. '' Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate it no more.
<p/>I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's, but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.
<p/>I preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy. Jane suits me: do I suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)?''
<p/><div class="bookquote">``To the finest fibre of my nature, sir. ''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be married instantly.

<p/>Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) dinner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">``We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way. ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pursued his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own thoughts without heeding me.
<p/>'' Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more wisely. I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.
<p/>Divine justice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death.
<p/>I, in my stiff- necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever.
<p/>You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness?
<p/>Of late, Jane--only--only of late --I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom. I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.
<p/>Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night, a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow, sullenness.
<p/>I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere. '' I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere find you, you must be dead.
<p/>Late that night--perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed good to Him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.
<p/>I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.
<p/>I asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and peace once more.
<p/>That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--`Jane!
<p/>'' I longed for thee, Janet! Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh! Jane! Jane!' '' <div class="bookquote">``Did you speak these words aloud?''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">``I did, Jane. If any listener had heard me, he (<font color='blue'><b>listener</b></font>) would have thought me mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy.''
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?'' '' Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange point.
<p/>You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is that I heard what I now relate.
<p/>a voice--I cannot tell whence the voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind
<p/>I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.
<p/>'' As I exclaimed `Jane! Jane! Jane!' the words--`Where are you?' '' Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating. '
<p/>Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words. Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow
<p/>: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting. In spirit, I believe we must have met.
<p/>You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!
<p/>Reader, it was on Monday night--near midnight--that I too had received the mysterious summons: those were the very words by which I replied to it.
<p/>'' I listened to Mr. Rochester's narrative, but made no disclosure in return. The coincidence struck me as too awful and inexplicable to be communicated or discussed.
<p/>If I told anything, my tale would be such as must necessarily make a profound impression on the mind of my hearer: and that mind, yet from its sufferings too prone to gloom, needed not the deeper shade of the supernatural.
<p/>You cannot now wonder,'' continued my master, <div class="bookquote">``that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before.
<p/>I kept these things then, and pondered them in my heart. ''  (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>Now, I thank God! I know it to be otherwise.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) put me off his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knee, rose, and reverently lifting his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hat from his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) brow, and bending his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sightless eyes to the earth, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stood in mute devotion.
<p/>Yes, I thank God!'' Only the last words of the worship were audible. '' I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has remembered mercy.
<p/>I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!'' Then he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) stretched his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) hand out to be led.
<p/>I took that dear hand, held it a moment to my lips, then let it pass round my shoulder: being so much lower of stature than he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), I served both for his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) prop and guide.
<p/>We entered the wood, and wended homeward. CHAPTER XXXVIII--CONCLUSION Reader , I married him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). A quiet wedding we had: he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present.
<p/>When we got back from church, I went into the kitchen of the manor-house, where Mary was cooking the dinner and John cleaning the knives, and I said--
<p/>The housekeeper and her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) husband were both of that decent phlegmatic order of people, to whom one may at any time safely communicate a remarkable piece of news without incurring the danger of having one's ears pierced by some shrill ejaculation, and subsequently stunned by a torrent of wordy wonderment.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning. ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ann/Mary Ann Wilson</b></font>)</div>Mary did look up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did stare at me:
<p/>the ladle with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was basting a pair of chickens roasting at the fire, did for some three minutes hang suspended in air; and for the same space of time John's knives also had rest from the polishing process: but
<p/>A short time after she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) pursued--<div class="bookquote">``I seed you go out with the master, but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;''  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) basted away.
<p/>Mary, bending again over the roast, said only-- <div class="bookquote">``Have you, Miss? Well, for sure! ''  (<font color='red'><b>Mary/Mary Ann/Mary Ann Wilson</b></font>)</div>John, when I turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), was grinning from ear to ear.
<p/>I telled Mary how it would be,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said: <div class="bookquote">``I knew what Mr. Edward''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-John was an old servant, and had known his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) master when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was the cadet of the house, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) often gave him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
<p/>his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) Christian name-RRB---<div class="bookquote">``I knew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would not wait long neither: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)'s done right, for aught

<p/>'' I put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hand a five-pound note. Without waiting to hear more, I left the kitchen. In passing the door of that sanctum some time after, I caught the words--
<p/>'' She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'ll happen do better for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) nor ony o`t' grand ladies. '' And again, <div class="bookquote">``If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ben't one o' th' handsomest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)'s noan faal and varry good-natured; and i' his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) een
<p/>I wrote to Moor House and to Cambridge immediately, to say what I had done: fully explaining also why I had thus acted.
<p/>Diana announced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) would just give me time to get over the honeymoon, and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) would come and see me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Diana</b></font>) had better not wait till then, Jane,''  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rochester</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Rochester, when I read her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">``if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine our life long

<p/>How St. John received the news, I don't know: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) never answered the letter in which I communicated it: yet six months after he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wrote to me, without, however, mentioning Mr. Rochester's name or alluding to my marriage.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) has maintained a regular, though not frequent, correspondence ever since: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) hopes I am happy, and trusts I am not of those who live without God in the world, and only mind earthly things.
<p/>'' His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) letter was then calm, and, though very serious, kind. You have not quite forgotten little Adele, have you, reader?
<p/>I had not; I soon asked and obtained leave of Mr. Rochester, to go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) at the school where he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>).
<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) frantic joy at beholding me again moved me much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) looked pale and thin: she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) was not happy.
<p/>I found the rules of the establishment were too strict, its course of study too severe for a child of her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) age: I took her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) home with me.
<p/>I meant to become her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) governess once more, but I soon found this impracticable; my time and cares were now required by another--my husband needed them all.
<p/>So I sought out a school conducted on a more indulgent system, and near enough to permit of my visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) often, and bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) home sometimes.
<p/>I took care she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) should never want for anything that could contribute to her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) comfort: she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) soon settled in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) new abode, became very happy there, and made fair progress in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) studies.
<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) grew up, a sound English education corrected in a great measure her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) French defects; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) left school, I found in her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) a pleasing and obliging companion: docile, good-tempered, and well-principled.
<p/>By her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) grateful attention to me and mine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>) has long since well repaid any little kindness I ever had it in my power to offer her (<font color='blue'><b>Adele</b></font>).
<p/>My tale draws to its close: one word respecting my experience of married life, and one brief glance at the fortunes of those whose names have most frequently recurred in this narrative, and I have done.
<p/>I have now been married ten years. I know what it is to live entirely for and with what I love best on earth.
<p/>I hold myself supremely blest--blest beyond what language can express; because I am my husband's life as fully as he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) is mine.
<p/>No woman was ever nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mate than I am: ever more absolutely bone of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) bone and flesh of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) flesh.
<p/>I know no weariness of my Edward's society: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) knows none of mine, any more than we each do of the pulsation of the heart that beats in our separate bosoms; consequently, we are ever together.
<p/>We talk, I believe, all day long: to talk to each other is but a more animated and an audible thinking.
<p/>All my confidence is bestowed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) confidence is devoted to me; we are precisely suited in character--perfect concord is the result.
<p/>Mr. Rochester continued blind the first two years of our union; perhaps it was that circumstance that drew us so very near--that knit us so very close:
<p/>To be together is for us to be at once as free as in solitude, as gay as in company. for I was then his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) vision, as I am still his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) right hand.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) saw nature--he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) saw books through me; and never did I weary of gazing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) behalf, and of putting into words the effect of field, tree, town, river, cloud, sunbeam--of the landscape before us; of the weather round us--and impressing by sound on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) ear what light could no longer stamp on his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eye.
<p/>Never did I weary of reading to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>); never did I weary of conducting him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) wished to go: of doing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) wished to be done.
<p/>And there was a pleasure in my services, most full, most exquisite, even though sad--because he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) claimed these services without painful shame or damping humiliation.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) loved me so truly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) knew no reluctance in profiting by my attendance: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) felt I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) so fondly, that to yield that attendance was to indulge my sweetest wishes.
<p/>One morning at the end of the two years, as I was writing a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) dictation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) came and bent over me, and said--<div class="bookquote">``Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your neck?
<p/>Literally, I was -LRB-what he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) often called me-RRB- the apple of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eye. ''  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I had a gold watch-chain: I answered <div class="bookquote">``Yes.''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>'' And have you a pale blue dress on? '' -LCB-And have you a pale blue dress on? : p435.jpg-RCB- I had.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) informed me then, that for some time he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had fancied the obscurity clouding one eye was becoming less dense; and that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) was sure of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) and I went up to London. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) had the advice of an eminent oculist; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) eventually recovered the sight of that one eye.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) cannot now see very distinctly: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) cannot read or write much; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) can find his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) way without being led by the hand: the sky is no longer a blank to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>)--the earth no longer a void.
<p/>When his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) first-born was put into his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) arms, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) could see that the boy had inherited his (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) own eyes, as they once were--large, brilliant, and black.
<p/>On that occasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rochester</b></font>) again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy. My Edward and I, then, are happy: and the more so, because those we most love are happy likewise.
<p/>Diana and Mary Rivers are both married: alternately, once every year, they come to see us, and we go to see them.
<p/>Diana's husband is a captain in the navy, a gallant officer and a good man. Mary's is a clergyman, a college friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother's, and, from his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attainments and principles, worthy of the connection.
<p/>Both Captain Fitzjames and Mr. Wharton love their wives, and are loved by them. As to St. John Rivers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) left England: he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) went to India.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) entered on the path he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) had marked for himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) pursues it still. A more resolute, indefatigable pioneer never wrought amidst rocks and dangers.
<p/>Firm, faithful, and devoted, full of energy, and zeal, and truth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) labours for his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) race; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) clears their painful way to improvement; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) hews down like a giant the prejudices of creed and caste that encumber it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) may be stern; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) may be exacting; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) may be ambitious yet; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) is the sternness of the warrior Greatheart, who guards his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) pilgrim convoy from the onslaught of Apollyon.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) is the exaction of the apostle, who speaks but for Christ, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) says--<div class="bookquote">``Whosoever will come after me, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) deny himself, and take up his (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) cross and follow me.
<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Rivers</b></font>) is the ambition of the high master-spirit, which aims to fill a place in the first rank of those who are redeemed from the earth--who stand without fault before the throne of God, who share the last mighty victories of the Lamb, who are called, and chosen, and faithful.
<p/>Himself has hitherto sufficed to the toil, and the toil draws near its close: his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) glorious sun hastens to its setting.
<p/>The last letter I received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) drew from my eyes human tears, and yet filled my heart with divine joy: he (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) anticipated his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) sure reward, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lamb</b></font>) incorruptible crown.
<p/>I know that a stranger's hand will write to me next, to say that the good and faithful servant has been called at length into the joy of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) Lord.
<p/>No fear of death will darken St. John's last hour: his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) mind will be unclouded, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart will be undaunted, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hope will be sure, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) faith steadfast.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>St. John is unmarried: he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) never will marry now. And why weep for this?
