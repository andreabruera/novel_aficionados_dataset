$miss_mary_morstan$ contacted her father only friend who was in the same regiment and had since retired to england #one# major john $mr_bartholomew_sholto$ but he denied knowing her father had returned
the second puzzle is that she has received six pearls in the mail from an anonymous benefactor #one# per year since after answering an anonymous newspaper query inquiring for her
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ takes the #case# and soon discovers that major $mr_bartholomew_sholto$ had died in and that within short span of time $miss_mary_morstan$ began to receive the pearls implying connection
the only clue $miss_mary_morstan$ can give $mr_sherlock_holmes$ is map of fortress found in her father desk with the names of $jonathan_small$ mahomet singh abdullah khan and dost akbar
$mr_sherlock_holmes$ $dr_watson$ and $miss_mary_morstan$ meet $mr_thaddeus_sholto$ $mr_bartholomew_sholto$ the son of the late major $mr_bartholomew_sholto$ and the anonymous sender of the pearls

while the police wrongly take $mr_thaddeus_sholto$ in as suspect $mr_sherlock_holmes$ deduces that there are two persons involved in the murder #one# legged #man# $jonathan_small$ as well as another small accomplice

small got penal servitude on the andaman islands and after years he overheard that john $mr_bartholomew_sholto$ had lost much money gambling and cannot even sell his commission therefore he will have to resign

when $mr_bartholomew_sholto$ found the treasure small planned to only steal it but claims miscommunication led tonga to kill $mr_bartholomew_sholto$ as well
it was the news of his escape that shocked $mr_bartholomew_sholto$ into his fatal illness small claims the agra treasure brought nothing but bad luck to anyone who came in touch with it

half his #life# building breakwater in the andaman islands and the rest of his #life# digging drains in dartmoor prison stoddart wanted to produce an english version of lippincott with british editor and british contributors

as with the first #story# study in scarlet produced two years previously the sign of the four was not particularly successful to start with
it was the short #story# published from onwards in strand magazine that made household names of $mr_sherlock_holmes$ and his creator
