in st petersburg anna_arkadyevna and alexey_vronsky stay in one of the best hotels but take separate suites it becomes clear that whilst alexey_vronsky is still able to move freely in russian society anna_arkadyevna is barred from it
even her old friend princess betsy_tverskaya who has had affairs herself evades her company anna_arkadyevna starts to become anxious that alexey_vronsky no longer loves her
meanwhile alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin is comforted by countess lidia_ivanovna an enthusiast of religious and mystic ideas fashionable with the upper classes she advises him to keep seryozha away from anna_arkadyevna and to tell him his mother is dead
however seryozha refuses to believe that this is true anna_arkadyevna visits seryozha uninvited on his ninth birthday but is discovered by alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin
anna_arkadyevna desperate to regain at least some of her former position in society attends show at the theatre at which all of st petersburg high society are present
alexey_vronsky begs her not to go but he is unable to bring himself to explain to her why she cannot attend
at the theatre anna_arkadyevna is openly snubbed by her former friends one of whom makes deliberate scene and leaves the theatre
unable to find place for themselves in st petersburg anna_arkadyevna and alexey_vronsky leave for alexey_vronsky own country estate dolly her mother the princess scherbatskaya and dolly children spend the summer with nikolay_levin and kitty_shtcherbatskaya
the levins life is simple and unaffected although nikolay_levin is uneasy at the invasion of so many scherbatskys he becomes extremely jealous when one of the visitors vassenka_veslovsky flirts openly with the pregnant kitty_shtcherbatskaya
nikolay_levin tries to overcome his jealousy and briefly succeeds during hunt with vassenka_veslovsky and pyotr_oblonsky but eventually succumbs to his feeling and orders vassenka_veslovsky to leave in an embarrassing scene
when dolly visits anna_arkadyevna she is struck by the difference between the levins aristocratic yet simple home life and alexey_vronsky overtly luxurious and lavish country estate
vassenka_veslovsky immediately goes to stay with anna_arkadyevna and alexey_vronsky at their nearby estate she is also unable to keep pace with anna_arkadyevna fashionable dresses or alexey_vronsky extravagant spending on hospital he is building
in addition all is not quite well with anna_arkadyevna and alexey_vronsky dolly notices anna_arkadyevna anxious behaviour and her uncomfortable flirtations with vassenka_veslovsky
alexey_vronsky makes an emotional request to dolly asking her to convince anna_arkadyevna to divorce alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin so that the two might marry and live normally
when alexey_vronsky leaves for several days of provincial elections anna_arkadyevna becomes convinced that she must marry him to prevent him from leaving her
anna_arkadyevna has become intensely jealous of alexey_vronsky and cannot bear it when he leaves her even for short excursions after anna_arkadyevna writes to alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin she and alexey_vronsky leave the countryside for moscow
while visiting moscow for kitty_shtcherbatskaya confinement nikolay_levin quickly gets used to the city fast paced expensive and frivolous society life he accompanies stiva to gentleman club where the two meet alexey_vronsky
nikolay_levin and stiva pay visit to anna_arkadyevna who is occupying her empty days by being patroness to an orphaned english girl
nikolay_levin is initially uneasy about the visit but anna_arkadyevna easily puts him under her spell when he admits to kitty_shtcherbatskaya that he has visited anna_arkadyevna she accuses him of falling in love with her
anna_arkadyevna cannot understand why she can attract man like nikolay_levin who has young and beautiful new wife but can no longer attract alexey_vronsky
the couple are later reconciled realising that moscow society life has had negative corrupting effect on nikolay_levin her relationship with alexey_vronsky is under increasing strain because he can move freely in russian society while she remains excluded
her increasing bitterness boredom and jealousy cause the couple to argue anna_arkadyevna uses morphine to help her sleep habit she began while living with alexey_vronsky at his country estate
she has become dependent on it meanwhile after long and difficult labour kitty_shtcherbatskaya gives birth to son dmitri nicknamed mitya nikolay_levin is both horrified and profoundly moved by the sight of the tiny helpless baby
during the visit stiva asks alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin to grant anna_arkadyevna divorce which would require him to confess to non existent affair but alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin decisions are now governed by french clairvoyant recommended by lidia_ivanovna
the clairvoyant apparently had vision in his sleep during stiva visit and gives alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin cryptic message that he interprets in way such that he must decline the request for divorce
stiva visits alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin to seek his commendation for new post anna_arkadyevna becomes increasingly jealous and irrational towards alexey_vronsky whom she suspects of having love affairs with other women
she is also convinced that he will give in to his mother plans to marry him off to rich society woman
they have bitter row and anna_arkadyevna believes the relationship is over she starts to think of suicide as an escape from her torments
in her mental and emotional confusion she sends telegram to alexey_vronsky asking him to come home to her and then pays visit to dolly and kitty_shtcherbatskaya
anna_arkadyevna confusion and anger overcome her and in parallel to the railway worker accidental death in part she commits suicide by throwing herself under the carriage of passing train
sergei ivanovich nikolay_levin brother latest book is ignored by readers and critics and he joins the new pan slavic movement stiva gets the post he desired so much and alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin takes custody of alexey_vronsky and anna_arkadyevna baby annie
a group of russian volunteers including the suicidal alexey_vronsky depart from russia to fight in the orthodox serbian revolt that has broken out against the turks
a lightning storm occurs at nikolay_levin estate while his wife and newborn son are outdoors and in his fear for their safety nikolay_levin realizes that he does indeed love his son as much as he loves kitty_shtcherbatskaya
after speaking at length to peasant nikolay_levin has true change of heart concluding that he does believe in the christian principles taught to him in childhood and no longer questions his faith
kitty_shtcherbatskaya family is concerned that man as altruistic as her husband does not consider himself to be christian he realizes that one must decide for oneself what is acceptable concerning one own faith and beliefs
he chooses not to tell kitty_shtcherbatskaya of the change that he has undergone nikolay_levin is initially displeased that his return to his faith does not bring with it complete transformation to righteousness
however at the end of the story nikolay_levin arrives at the conclusion that despite his newly accepted beliefs he is human and will go on making mistakes
tolstoy style in anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina is considered by many critics to be transitional forming bridge between the realist and modernist novel
according to ruth benson in her book about tolstoy heroines tolstoy diaries show how displeased he was with his style and approach to writing in early drafts of anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina quoting him as stating i loathe what have written
the galleys of anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina for the april issue of russkij vestnik now lie on my table and really dont have the heart to correct them
his life can now be meaningfully and truthfully oriented toward righteousness everything in them is so rotten and the whole thing should be rewritten
anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina is commonly thought to explore the themes of hypocrisy jealousy faith fidelity family marriage society progress carnal desire and passion and the agrarian connection to land in contrast to the lifestyles of the city
translator rosemary edmonds wrote that tolstoy does not explicitly moralise in the book but instead allows his themes to emerge naturally from the vast panorama of russian life
all that has been printed too scrapped and melted down thrown away renounced ji she also says one of the novel key messages is that no one may build their happiness on another pain
nikolay_levin is often considered semi autobiographical portrayal of tolstoy own beliefs struggles and life events tolstoy first name is lev and the russian surname nikolay_levin means of lev
according to footnotes in the pevear volokhonsky translation the viewpoints nikolay_levin supports throughout the novel in his arguments match tolstoy outspoken view on the same issues
additionally nikolay_levin request that his fiancée read his diary as way of disclosing his fault and previous sexual encounters parallels tolstoy own requests to his fiancée sophia behrs
the events in the novel take place against the backdrop of rapid transformations as result of the liberal reforms initiated by emperor alexander_nevsky ii of russia principal among these the emancipation reform of followed by judicial reform including jury system military reforms the introduction of elected local governments zemstvo the fast development of railroads banks industry telegraph the rise of new business elites and the decline of the old landed aristocracy freer press the awakening of public opinion the pan slavism movement the woman question volunteering to aid serbia in its military conflict with the ottoman empire in etc
moreover according to gareth jones nikolay_levin proposed to kitty_shtcherbatskaya in the same way as tolstoy to sophia behrs these contemporary developments are hotly debated by the characters in the novel
the suburban railway station of obiralovka where one of the characters commits suicide is now known as the town of zheleznodorozhny moscow oblast

anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina translated by david magarshack oxford university press anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina translated by marian schwartz yale university press writing in the year academic zoja pavlovskis petit compared the different translations of anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina on the market
commenting on the revision of constance garnett translation she says the revision by kent berberova the latter no mean stylist herself succeeds in correcting errors tightening the prose converting briticisms and casting light on areas mrs garnett did not explore
their edition shows an excellent understanding of the detail of tolstoy world for instance the fact that the elaborate coiffure kitty_shtcherbatskaya wears to the ball is not her own hair a detail that eludes most other translators and at the same time they use english imaginatively kitty_shtcherbatskaya shoes delighted her feet rather than eemed to make her feet lighter maude paraphrase
the purist will be pleased to see kent berberova give all the russian names in full as used by the author any reader will be grateful for the footnotes that elucidate anything not immediately accessible to someone not well acquainted with imperial russia
she further comments on the maudes translation the revised garnett and the magarshack versions do better justice to the original but still the world classics edition offers very full list of characters and good notes based on the maudes
this emended garnett should probably be reader first choice on edmonds translation she states has the advantage of solid scholarship
yet she lacks true sensitivity for the language missing many subtlety on carmichael version she comments this is a rather breezily readable translation but there are errors and misunderstandings as well as clumsiness
there is occasional awkwardness and imprecision but magarshack understands the text and even when unable to translate an idiom closely he renders its real meaning
on wettlin soviet version she writes steady but uninspired and sounds like english prose written by russian who knows the language but is not completely at home in it
on magarshack translation she comments offers natural simple and direct english prose that is appropriate to tolstoy russian the advantage is that wettlin misses hardly any cultural detail
in in quest of tolstoy hughes mclean devotes full chapter which english anna_arkadyevna comparing different translations of anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina translation while perfectly adequate is in my view not consistently or unequivocally superior to other in the market
he states his recommendations in the last two pages of the survey none of the existing translations is actively bad one choice must therefore be based on nuances subtleties and refinements
he eliminates the maudes for disturbing errors and did not find either the margashack or carmichael ever superior to the other and the lack of notes is drawback
on edmonds version he states her version has no notes at all and all too frequently errs in the direction of making tolstoy robust awkwardness conform to the translator notion of good english style
mclean recommendations are the kent berberova revision of garnett translation and the pevear and volokhonsky version i consider the gkb very good version even though it is based on an out of date russian text
kent and berberova did much more thorough and careful revision of garnett translation than gibian did of the maude one and they have supplied fairly full notes conveniently printed at the bottom of the page
mclean takes pevear and volokhonsky to task for not using the best critical text the zaidenshnur zhdanov text and offering flawed notes without consulting j turner madame_karenina companion although he calls their version certainly good translation
reviewing the translations by bartlett and schwartz for the new york time book review masha_tchibisova gessen noted that each new translation of anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina ended up highlighting an aspect of tolstoy variable voice in the novel and thus the tolstoy of garnett is monocled british gentleman who is simply incapable of taking his characters as seriously as they take themselves
pevear and volokhonsky created reasonable calm storyteller who communicated in conversational american english rosamund bartlett creates an updated ironic brit version of tolstoy
gessen found schwartz translation to be formally closer to the original russian but often weighed down with detail as result bartlett translation like pevear and volokhonsky was rendered in more idiomatic english and more readable
marian schwartz has produced what is probably the least smooth talking and most contradictory tolstoy yet main article eastern slavic naming customs
the title has been translated as both anna_arkadyevna alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin and anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina the first instance naturalizes the russian name into english whereas the second is direct transliteration of the actual russian name
vladimir nabokov explains in russian surname ending in consonant acquires final a except for the cases of such names that cannot be declined and except adjectives like oblonskaya when designating woman but only when the reference is to female stage performer should english feminise russian surname following french custom la pavlova the pavlova
ivanov and alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin wives are mrs ivanov and mrs alexey_alexandrovitch_karenin in britain and the us not mrs ivanova or mrs madame_karenina
nabokov favours the first convention removing the russian a to naturalize the name into english but subsequent translators mostly allow anna_arkadyevna actual russian name to stand
larissa volokhonsky herself russian prefers the second option as did aylmer and louise maude who lived in russia for many years and were friends of tolstoy
other translators like constance garnett and rosemary edmonds both non russians prefer the first main article adaptations of anna_arkadyevna madame_karenina the novel has been adapted into various media including opera film television ballet and radio drama
