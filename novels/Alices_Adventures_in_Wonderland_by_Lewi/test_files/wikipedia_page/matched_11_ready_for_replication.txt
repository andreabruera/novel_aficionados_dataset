$alice$ adventures in wonderland commonly shortened to $alice$ in wonderland is an novel written by english author charles lutwidge dodgson under the pseudonym lewis carroll
it tells of young girl named $alice$ falling through rabbit hole into fantasy world populated by peculiar anthropomorphic creatures the tale plays with logic giving the story lasting popularity with adults as well as with children
in both popular culture and literature especially in the fantasy genre page from the original manuscript copy of $alice$ adventures under ground $alice$ was published in three years after charles lutwidge dodgson and the reverend robinson duckworth rowed in boat on july up the isis with the three young daughters of henry liddell the vice chancellor of oxford university and dean of christ church lorina charlotte liddell aged born prima in the #book# prefatory verse $alice$ pleasance liddell aged born secunda in the prefatory verse edith mary liddell aged born tertia in the prefatory verse
it is considered to be one of the best examples of the literary nonsense genre the journey began at folly bridge near oxford and ended five miles away in the village of godstow
during the trip charles dodgson told the girls story that featured bored little girl named $alice$ who goes looking for an adventure
the girls loved it and $alice$ liddell asked dodgson to write it down for her he began writing the manuscript of the story the next day although that earliest version no longer exists
the girls and dodgson took another boat trip month later when he elaborated the plot to the story of $alice$ and in november he began working on the manuscript in earnest
to add the finishing touches he researched natural history for the animals presented in the #book# and then had the #book# examined by other children particularly the children of george macdonald
he added his own illustrations but approached john tenniel to illustrate the #book# for publication telling him that the story had been well liked by children
on november he gave $alice$ the handwritten manuscript of $alice$ adventures under ground with illustrations by dodgson himself dedicating it as a christmas gift to dear child in memory of summer day
some including martin gardner speculate there was an earlier version that was destroyed later by dodgson when he wrote more elaborate copy by hand
but before $alice$ received her copy dodgson was already preparing it for publication and expanding the word original to words most notably adding the episodes about the cheshire cat and the mad tea party
chapter one down the rabbit hole $alice$ girl of seven years is feeling bored and drowsy while sitting on the riverbank with her elder sister
she follows it down rabbit hole when suddenly she falls long #way# to curious hall with many locked doors of all sizes
she finds small key to door too small for her to fit through but through it she sees an attractive garden
she then discovers bottle on table labelled drink me the contents of which cause her to shrink too small to reach the key which she has left on the table
she then notices talking clothed white rabbit with pocket watch run past she eats cake with eat me written on it in currants as the chapter closes
chapter two the pool of tears chapter two opens with $alice$ growing to such tremendous size her head hits the ceiling
after shrinking down again due to fan she had picked up $alice$ swims through her own tears and meets mouse who is swimming as well
she tries to make small talk with him in elementary french thinking he may be french mouse but her opening gambit où est ma chatte offends the mouse and he tries to escape her
the sea of tears becomes crowded with other animals and birds that have been swept away by the rising waters
$alice$ is unhappy and as she cries her tears flood the hallway chapter three the caucus race and long tale $alice$ and the other animals convene on the bank and the question among them is how to get dry again
a dodo decides that the best #thing# to dry them off would be caucus race which consists of everyone running in circle with no clear winner
the mouse gives them very dry lecture on william the conqueror $alice$ eventually frightens all the animals away unwittingly by talking about her moderately ferocious cat
chapter four the rabbit sends little $bill$ the white rabbit appears again in search of the duchess gloves and fan mistaking her for his maidservant mary ann he orders $alice$ to go into the house and retrieve them
inside the house she finds another little bottle and drinks from it immediately she starts growing again the horrified rabbit orders his gardener $bill$ the lizard to climb on the roof and go down the chimney
outside $alice$ hears the voices of animals that have gathered to gawk at her giant arm the crowd hurls pebbles at her which turn into little cakes
$alice$ eats them and they reduce her again in size chapter five advice from $caterpillar$ $alice$ comes upon mushroom and sitting on it is blue $caterpillar$ smoking hookah
before crawling away the $caterpillar$ tells $alice$ that one side of the mushroom will make her taller and the other side will make her shorter
the $caterpillar$ questions $alice$ and she admits to her current identity crisis compounded by her inability to remember poem she breaks off two pieces from the mushroom
one side makes her shrink smaller than ever while another causes her neck to grow high into the trees where pigeon mistakes her for serpent
with some effort $alice$ brings herself back to her normal height she stumbles upon small estate and uses the mushroom to reach more appropriate height
chapter six pig and pepper fish footman has an invitation for the duchess of the house which he delivers to frog footman
the duchess cook is throwing dishes and making soup that has too much pepper which causes $alice$ the duchess and her baby but not the cook or grinning cheshire cat to sneeze violently
$alice$ observes this transaction and after perplexing conversation with the frog lets herself into the house $alice$ is given the baby by the duchess and to her surprise the baby turns into pig
he disappears but his grin remains behind to float on its own in the air prompting $alice$ to remark that she has often seen cat without grin but never grin without cat
$alice$ becomes guest at mad tea party along with the march $hare$ the hatter and very tired dormouse who falls asleep frequently only to be violently awakened moments later by the march $hare$ and the hatter
the cheshire cat appears in tree directing her to the march $hare$ house chapter seven a mad tea party the characters give $alice$ many riddles and stories including the famous why is raven like writing desk
the hatter reveals that they have tea all day because time has punished him by eternally standing still at pm tea time
$alice$ becomes insulted and tired of being bombarded with riddles and she leaves claiming that it was the stupidest tea party that she had ever been to
$alice$ leaves the tea party and enters the garden where she comes upon three living playing cards painting the white roses on rose tree red because the queen of hearts hates white roses
$alice$ trying to play croquet with flamingo chapter eight the queen croquet ground a procession of more cards kings and queens and even the white rabbit enters the garden
the queen figure difficult to please introduces her signature phrase off with his head which she utters at the slightest dissatisfaction with subject
$alice$ is invited or some might say ordered to play game of croquet with the queen and the rest of her subjects but the game quickly descends into chaos
$alice$ then meets the king and queen live flamingos are used as mallets and hedgehogs as balls and $alice$ once again meets the cheshire cat
the queen of hearts then orders the cat to be beheaded only to have her executioner complain that this is impossible since the head is all that can be seen of him
because the cat belongs to the duchess the queen is prompted to release the duchess from prison to resolve the matter
chapter nine the mock turtle story the duchess is brought to the croquet ground at $alice$ request she ruminates on finding morals in everything around her
the queen of hearts dismisses her on the threat of execution and she introduces $alice$ to the $gryphon$ who takes her to the mock turtle
he tries to tell his story about how he used to be real turtle in school which the $gryphon$ interrupts so they can play game
the mock turtle is very sad even though he has no sorrow chapter ten lobster quadrille the mock turtle and the $gryphon$ dance to the lobster quadrille while $alice$ recites rather incorrectly
tis the voice of the lobster the mock turtle sings them beautiful soup during which the $gryphon$ drags $alice$ away for an impending trial
chapter eleven who stole the tarts $alice$ attends trial whereby the knave of hearts is accused of stealing the queen tarts
the jury is composed of various animals including $bill$ the lizard the white rabbit is the court trumpeter and the judge is the king of hearts
the dormouse scolds $alice$ and tells her she has no right to grow at such rapid pace and take up all the air
during the proceedings $alice$ finds that she is steadily growing larger $alice$ scoffs and calls the dormouse accusation ridiculous because everyone grows
meanwhile witnesses at the trial include the hatter who displeases and frustrates the king through his indirect answers to the questioning and the duchess cook
she accidentally knocks over the jury box with the animals inside them and the king orders the animals be placed back into their seats before the trial continues
and she cannot help it chapter twelve $alice$ evidence $alice$ is then called up as witness the king and queen order $alice$ to be gone citing rule
all persons more than mile high to leave the court but $alice$ disputes their judgement and refuses to leave she argues with the king and queen of hearts over the ridiculous proceedings eventually refusing to hold her tongue
but $alice$ is unafraid calling them out as just pack of cards just as they start to swarm over her
$alice$ sister wakes her up from dream brushing what turns out to be some leaves and not shower of playing cards from $alice$ face
the queen shouts her familiar off with her head $alice$ leaves her sister on the bank to imagine all the curious happenings for herself
further information list of minor characters in the $alice$ series the main characters in $alice$ adventures in wonderland are the following
theophilus carter has been suggested as model for the hatter in the annotated $alice$ martin gardner provides background information for the characters
the members of the boating party that first heard carroll tale show up in chapter a caucus race and long tale
$alice$ liddell herself is there while carroll is caricatured as the dodo because dodgson stuttered when he spoke he sometimes pronounced his last name as dodo dodgson
jessie willcox smith illustration of $alice$ surrounded by the characters of wonderland the duck refers to canon duckworth and the lory and eaglet to $alice$ liddell
one of tenniel illustrations in through the looking glass the sequel to $alice$ depicts the character referred to as the man in white paper whom $alice$ meets as fellow passenger riding on the train with her as caricature of disraeli wearing paper hat
the illustrations of the lion and the unicorn also in looking glass also bear striking resemblance to tenniel punch illustrations of gladstone and disraeli
sisters lorina and edith $bill$ the lizard may be play on the name of british prime minister benjamin disraeli it has been suggested by some writers that the hatter is reference to theophilus carter furniture dealer known in oxford
however it is unlikely that carter was the model for the hatter and there is no evidence that carroll ever invited tenniel to oxford for any purpose
tenniel apparently drew the hatter to resemble carter on suggestion of carroll the dormouse tells story about three little sisters named elsie lacie and tillie
these are the liddell sisters elsie is c lorina charlotte tillie is edith her family nickname is matilda and lacie is an anagram of $alice$
the mock turtle speaks of drawling master an old conger eel who came once week to teach drawling stretching and fainting in coils
this is reference to the art critic john ruskin who came once week to the liddell house to teach the children drawing sketching and painting in oils
the children did in fact learn well $alice$ liddell for one produced number of skilful watercolours the mock turtle also sings turtle soup
this is parody of song called star of the evening beautiful star which was performed as trio by lorina $alice$ and edith liddell for lewis carroll in the liddell home during the same summer in which he first told the story of $alice$ adventures under ground
carroll wrote multiple poems and songs for $alice$ adventures in wonderland including all in the golden afternoon the prefatory verse an original poem by carroll that recalls the rowing expedition on which he first told the story of $alice$ adventures underground
how doth the little crocodile a parody of isaac watts nursery rhyme against idleness and mischief the mouse tale an example of concrete poetry
you are old father william a parody of robert southey the old man comforts and how he gained them the duchess lullaby
speak roughly to your little boy a parody of david bates speak gently twinkle twinkle little bat a parody of jane taylor twinkle twinkle little star
the lobster quadrille a parody of mary botham howitt the spider and the fly tis the voice of the lobster a parody of isaac watts the sluggard beautiful soup a parody of james sayles star of the evening beautiful star the queen of hearts an actual nursery rhyme
white rabbit evidence martin gardner and other scholars have shown the #book# to be filled with many parodies of victorian popular culture suggesting it belongs in spirit with s gilbert and alfred cellier topsyturveydom
most of the #book# adventures may have been based on and influenced by people situations and buildings in oxford and at christ church g the rabbit hole which symbolised the actual stairs in the back of the main hall in christ church
a carving of griffon and rabbit as seen in ripon cathedral where carroll father was canon may have provided inspiration for the tale
since carroll was mathematician at christ church it has been suggested that there are many references and mathematical concepts in both this story and through the looking glass examples include
in chapter down the rabbit hole in the midst of shrinking $alice$ waxes philosophic concerning what final size she will end up as perhaps going out altogether like candle this pondering reflects the concept of limit
in chapter the pool of tears $alice$ tries to perform multiplication but produces some odd results let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven is
this explores the representation of numbers using different bases and positional numeral systems in base notation in base notation and could be in base notation
continuing this sequence going up three bases each time the result will continue to be less than in the corresponding base notation
they told me you had been to her the oh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate after in base the product would be a in base then c and so on
in chapter a mad tea party the march $hare$ the hatter and the dormouse give several examples in which the semantic value of sentence is not the same value of the converse of for example why you might just as well say that i see what eat is the same #thing# as i eat what see in logic and mathematics this is discussing converse relation
also in chapter $alice$ ponders what it means when the changing of seats around the circular table places them back at the beginning
the cheshire cat fades until it disappears entirely leaving only its wide grin suspended in the air leading $alice$ to marvel and note that she has seen cat without grin but never grin without cat
deep abstraction of concepts such as non euclidean geometry abstract algebra and the beginnings of mathematical logic was taking over mathematics at the time dodgson was writing
dodgson delineation of the relationship between cat and grin can be taken to represent the very concept of mathematics and number itself
for example instead of considering two or three apples one may easily consider the concept of apple upon which the concepts of two and three may seem to depend
a far more sophisticated jump is to consider the concepts of two and three by themselves just like grin originally seemingly dependent on the cat separated conceptually from its physical object
literary scholar melanie bayley asserted in the magazine new scientist that dodgson wrote $alice$ in wonderland in its final form as scathing satire on new modern mathematics that were emerging in the mid century
it has been suggested by several people including martin gardner and selwyn goodacre that dodgson had an interest in the french language choosing to make references and puns about it in the story
this is an observation of addition on the ring of integers modulo it is most likely that these are references to french lessons
a common feature of victorian middle class girl upbringing for example in the second chapter $alice$ posits that the mouse may be french
she therefore chooses to speak the first sentence of her french lesson #book# to it où est ma chatte in henri bué french translation $alice$ posits that the mouse may be italian and speaks italian to it
pat digging for apples could be cross language pun as pomme de terre literally apple of the earth means potato and pomme means apple
in the second chapter $alice$ initially addresses the mouse as mouse based on her memory of the noun declensions in her brother latin grammar a mouse of mouse to mouse a mouse mouse
these words correspond to the first five of latin six cases in traditional order established by medieval grammarians mus nominative muris genitive muri dative murem accusative mus vocative
in the eighth chapter three cards are painting the roses on rose tree red because they had accidentally planted white rose tree that the queen of hearts hates
the sixth case mure ablative is absent from $alice$ recitation red roses symbolised the english house of lancaster while white roses were the symbol for their rival house of york
while the #book# has remained in print and continually inspires new adaptations the cultural material from which it draws has become largely specialized knowledge
dr leon coward asserts the #book# uffers from readings which reflect today fascination with postmodernism and psychology rather than delving into an historically informed interpretation and speculates that this has been partly driven by audiences encountering the narrative through econd hand source explaining our impressions of the original text are based on multiplicity of reinterpretations
we dont necessarily realise we re missing anything in understanding the original product because we re usually never dealing with the original product
carina garland notes how the world is expressed via representations of food and appetite naming $alice$ frequent desire for consumption of both food and words her curious appetites
often the idea of eating coincides to make gruesome images after the riddle why is raven like writing desk the hatter claims that $alice$ might as well say i see what eat
i eat what see and so the riddle solution put forward by boe birns could be that a raven eats worms writing desk is worm eaten this idea of food encapsulates idea of life feeding on life for the worm is being eaten and then becomes the eater a horrific image of mortality
nina auerbach discusses how the novel revolves around eating and drinking which motivates much of her behaviour for the story is essentially about #thing# entering and leaving her mouth
the animals of wonderland are of particular interest for $alice$ relation to them shifts constantly because as lovell smith states $alice$ changes in size continually reposition her in the food chain serving as #way# to make her acutely aware of the eat or be eaten attitude that permeates wonderland
one of the author own illustrations the manuscript was illustrated by dodgson himself who added illustrations printed in facsimile edition in
john tenniel provided wood engraved illustrations for the published version of the #book# the first print run was destroyed or sold to america at carroll request because he was dissatisfied with the quality
the #book# was reprinted and published in john tenniel illustrations of $alice$ do not portray the real $alice$ liddell who had dark hair and short fringe

sir walter besant wrote that $alice$ in wonderland was #book# of that extremely rare kind which will belong to all the generations to come until the language becomes obsolete
title page of the original edition in dodgson tale was published as $alice$ adventures in wonderland by lewis carroll with illustrations by john tenniel
the first print run of was held back because tenniel objected to the print quality new edition released in december of the same year but carrying an date was quickly printed
the text blocks of the original edition were removed from the binding and sold with dodgson permission to the new york publishing house of appleton company
the binding for the appleton $alice$ was virtually identical to the macmillan $alice$ except for the publisher name at the #foot# of the spine
the title page of the appleton $alice$ was an insert cancelling the original macmillan title page of and bearing the new york publisher imprint and the date
