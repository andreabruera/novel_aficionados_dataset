Down the Rabbit-Hole Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister on the bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had peeped into the book her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, <div class="bookquote">`and what is the use of a book,'  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>thought Alice <div class="bookquote">`without pictures or conversations?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was considering in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own mind -LRB-as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, for the hot day made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feel very sleepy and stupid-RRB-, whether the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to itself, <div class="bookquote">`
-LRB-when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought it over afterwards, it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ought to have wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural-RRB-; but when the Rabbit actually TOOK
ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND Lewis Carroll THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0 CHAPTER Oh dear! Oh dear! I shall be late!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Rabbit</b></font>)</div>A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on
, Alice started to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet, for it flashed across her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran across the field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.
In another moment down went Alice after it, never once considering how in the world she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was to get out again.
The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way, and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself falling down a very deep well.
Either the well was very deep, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fell very slowly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had plenty of time as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went down to look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) and to wonder what was going to happen next.
First, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried to look down and make out what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was coming to, but it was too dark to see anything
; then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked at the sides of the well, and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves; here and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) took down a jar from one of the shelves as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) passed; it was labelled <div class="bookquote">`ORANGE MARMALADE' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>, but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) great disappointment it was empty: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fell past it. <div class="bookquote">`
Well!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought Alice to herself, <div class="bookquote">`after such a fall as this, I shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs! How brave they'll all think me at home!
Why, I wouldn't say anything about it, even if I fell off the top of the house!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Which was very likely true.-RRB-
Down, down, down. Would the fall NEVER come to an end! <div class="bookquote">` I wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?'
 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Let me see: that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' -LRB-for, you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good opportunity for showing off her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knowledge, as there was no one to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), still it was good practice to say it over-RRB- `
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said aloud. <div class="bookquote">` I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth. --yes, that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude or Longitude
I've got to?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Alice had no idea what Latitude was, or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to say.-RRB-
Presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began again. <div class="bookquote">` I wonder if I shall fall right THROUGH the earth! How funny it'll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward!
The Antipathies, I think--'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this time, as it didn't sound at all the right word-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`
--but I shall have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know. Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried to curtsey as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling through the air! Do you think you could manage it?-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`
And what an ignorant little girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)'ll think me for asking! No, it'll never do to ask: perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Down, down, down. There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon began talking again. <div class="bookquote">` Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I should think!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Dinah was the cat.-RRB- ` I hope they'll remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) saucer of milk at tea-time. Dinah my dear! I wish you were down here with me!
There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.
And here Alice began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of way, <div class="bookquote">`Do cats eat bats?
But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, <div class="bookquote">`Do bats eat cats?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for, you see, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) couldn't answer either question, it didn't much matter which way she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) very earnestly, <div class="bookquote">`Now, Dinah, tell me the truth: did you ever eat a bat?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Dinah</b></font>)</div>Alice was not a bit hurt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) jumped up on to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet in a moment: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
There was not a moment to be lost: away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, <div class="bookquote">`Oh my ears and whiskers, how late it's getting!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was close behind it when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) turned the corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof.
when suddenly, thump! thump! down she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over. There were doors
all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the other, trying every door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked sadly down the middle, wondering how she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was ever to get out again.
Suddenly she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came upon a little three-legged table, all made of solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key, and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall; but, alas!
either the locks were too large, or the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of them.
However, on the second time round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came upon a low curtain she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not noticed before, and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high
Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage, not much larger than a rat-hole: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not even get her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head through the doorway; <div class="bookquote">`and even if my head would go through,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought poor Alice, <div class="bookquote">`it would be of very little use without my shoulders.
: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried the little golden key in the lock, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) great delight it fitted! Oh, how I wish I could shut up like a telescope!
For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.
There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went back to the table, half hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might find another key on it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes: this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found a little bottle on it, -LRB-`which certainly was not here before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice,-RRB- and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label, with the words <div class="bookquote">`DRINK ME'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>beautifully printed on it in large letters.
It was all very well to say <div class="bookquote">`Drink me,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>but the wise little Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry. <div class="bookquote">`
No, I'll look first,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`and see whether it's marked ``poison'' or not' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them: such as, that a red-hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked <div class="bookquote">`poison,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or later.
However, this bottle was NOT marked <div class="bookquote">`poison,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>so Alice ventured to taste it, and finding it very nice, -LRB-it had, in fact, a sort of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) very soon finished it off.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <div class="bookquote">`What a curious feeling!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">`I must be shutting up like a telescope.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now only ten inches high, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face brightened up at the thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.
I think I could, if I only knew how to begin.' * And so it was indeed First, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waited for a few minutes to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was going to shrink any further
: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt a little nervous about this; <div class="bookquote">`for it might end, you know,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Alice to herself, `in my going out altogether, like a candle.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not remember ever having seen such a thing.
After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) decided on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got to the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had forgotten the little golden key, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went back to the table for it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not possibly reach it: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could see it quite plainly through the glass, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) best to climb up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had tired herself out with trying, the poor little thing sat down and cried. <div class="bookquote">`
Come, there's no use in crying like that!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Alice to herself, rather sharply; <div class="bookquote">`I advise you to leave off this minute!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) generally gave herself very good advice, -LRB-though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) very seldom followed it-RRB-, and sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes; and once she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered trying to box her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was playing against herself, for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people. <div class="bookquote">`
I wonder what I should be like then?'  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>But it's no use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!
Soon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on which the words <div class="bookquote">`EAT ME'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were beautifully marked in currants. <div class="bookquote">`
Well, I'll eat it,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">`and if it makes me grow larger, I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I don't care which happens!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Why, there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable person!' She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, <div class="bookquote">`
Which way?' (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>, holding her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand on the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head to feel which way it was growing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite surprised to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remained the same size: to be sure, this generally happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen, that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * CHAPTER II.
The Pool of Tears <div class="bookquote">`Curiouser and curiouser!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>cried Alice -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was so much surprised, that for the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) quite forgot how to speak good English-RRB-; `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that ever was!
-LRB-for when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so far off-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">`
Which way? So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set to work, and very soon finished off the cake. * Good-bye, feet!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?
I'm sure I shan't be able! I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you: you must manage the best way
you can;--but I must be kind to them,' thought Alice, <div class="bookquote">`or perhaps they won't walk the way I want to go!
Let me see: I'll give them a new pair of boots every Christmas.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on planning to herself how she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would manage it. <div class="bookquote">`
They must go by the carrier,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought; `and how funny it'll seem, sending presents to one's own feet! And how odd the directions will look!
Just then her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head struck against the roof of the hall: in fact she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now more than nine feet high, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at once took up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.
It was as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could do, lying down on one side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get through was more hopeless than ever: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat down and began to cry again. <div class="bookquote">`
You ought to be ashamed of yourself,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">`a great girl like you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might well say this-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">`to go on crying in this way!
ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.. HEARTHRUG, NEAR THE FENDER, -LRB-WITH ALICE'S LOVE-RRB-. Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Poor Alice! Stop this moment, I tell you!'
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on all the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall.
After a time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard a little pattering of feet in the distance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hastily dried her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes to see what was coming.
It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other: he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to himself as he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) came, `Oh!
Alice felt so desperate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit came near her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began, in a low, timid voice, <div class="bookquote">`If you please, sir--'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) could go.
Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very hot, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) kept fanning herself all the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on talking: <div class="bookquote">`
the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) be savage if I've kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) waiting!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Dear, dear! How queer everything is to-day!
And yesterday things went on just as usual. I wonder if I've been changed in the night? Let me think: was I the same when I got up this morning?
I almost think I can remember feeling a little different. But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in the world am I?
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) began thinking over all the children she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) knew that were of the same age as herself, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) could have been changed for any of them. <div class="bookquote">`
I'm sure I'm not Ada,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ada</b></font>) hair goes in such long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm sure I can't be Mabel,
Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for I know all sorts of things, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>), oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>) knows such a very little!
Besides, SHE'S she (<font color='blue'><b>Mabel</b></font>), and I'm I, and-- oh dear, how puzzling it all is! I'll try if I know all the things I used to know.
Let me see: four times five is twelve, and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is-- oh dear!
I shall never get to twenty at that rate! However, the Multiplication Table doesn't signify: let's try Geography. London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome, and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!
I'll try and say ``How doth the little--''' and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hands on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) lap as if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) were saying lessons, and began to repeat it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) voice sounded hoarse and strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:-- `How doth the little crocodile Improve his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shining tail, And pour the waters of the Nile
I must have been changed for Mabel! On every golden scale! <div class="bookquote">` How cheerfully he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) seems to grin, How neatly spread his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) claws, And welcome little fishes in With gently smiling jaws!'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes filled with tears again as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on, `I must be Mabel after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so many lessons to learn!
<div class="bookquote">` No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm Mabel, I'll stay down here! It'll be no use their putting their heads down and saying ``Come up again, dear!
'' I shall only look up and say ``Who am I then? Tell me that first, and then, if I like being that person, I'll come up: if not
, I'll stay down here till I'm somebody else''--but, oh dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>cried Alice, with a sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads down!
As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands, and was surprised to see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had put on one of the Rabbit's little white kid gloves while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was talking. <div class="bookquote">`
I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>How CAN I have done that?' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">` I must be growing small again.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got up and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that, as nearly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could guess, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now about two feet high, and was going on shrinking rapidly
: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was holding, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dropped it hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether. <div class="bookquote">`
That WAS a narrow escape!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Alice, a good deal frightened at the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in existence; <div class="bookquote">`and now for the garden!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the little door was shut again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before, <div class="bookquote">`and things are worse than ever,'  (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>thought the poor child, <div class="bookquote">`for I never was so small as this before, never!
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran with all speed back to the little door: but, alas! And I declare it's too bad, that it is!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the child</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said these words her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) foot slipped, and in another moment, splash! she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chin in salt water.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first idea was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had somehow fallen into the sea, <div class="bookquote">`and in that case I can go back by railway,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself.
-LRB-Alice had been to the seaside once in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life, and had come to the general conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and behind them a railway station.-RRB-
However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon made out that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was in the pool of tears which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had wept when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was nine feet high. <div class="bookquote">`
I wish I hadn't cried so much!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) swam about, trying to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) way out. ` I shall be punished for it now, I suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!
Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered how small she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself. <div class="bookquote">`
That WILL be a queer thing, to be sure! However, everything is queer to-day.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, <div class="bookquote">`to speak to this mouse?
Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should think very likely it can talk: at any rate, there's no harm in trying.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began: <div class="bookquote">`O Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never done such a thing before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered having seen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) brother's Latin Grammar, <div class="bookquote">`A mouse--of a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--O mouse!' (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>-RRB-
The Mouse looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) rather inquisitively, and seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to wink with one of its little eyes, but it said nothing. <div class="bookquote">`
Perhaps it doesn't understand English,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Mouse</b></font>)</div>thought Alice; <div class="bookquote">`I daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the Conqueror.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>-LRB-For, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knowledge of history, Alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.-RRB-
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began again: <div class="bookquote">`Ou est ma chatte?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which was the first sentence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) French lesson-book. The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright. <div class="bookquote">`
Oh, I beg your pardon!'  (<font color='red'><b>The Mouse</b></font>)</div>cried Alice hastily, afraid that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had hurt the poor animal's feelings. <div class="bookquote">` I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not like cats!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. <div class="bookquote">`
Would YOU like cats if you were me?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, perhaps not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice in a soothing tone: <div class="bookquote">`don't be angry about it.
And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah : I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) is such a dear quiet thing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice went on, half to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) swam lazily about in the pool, `and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) paws and washing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s such a capital one for catching mice
cried Alice again, for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt certain it must be really offended. <div class="bookquote">`
-- oh, I beg your pardon!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>We won't talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) any more if you'd rather not.' <div class="bookquote">` We indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tail. <div class="bookquote">`
As if I would talk on such a subject! Our family always HATED cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! Don't let me hear the name again!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I won't indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation. <div class="bookquote">` Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly: <div class="bookquote">`There is such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!
And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you know, and he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) says it's so useful
A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair! , it's worth a hundred pounds! He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) says it kills all the rats and--
For the Mouse was swimming away from her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.
oh dear!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>cried Alice in a sorrowful tone, <div class="bookquote">` I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) called softly after it, `Mouse dear!
When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): its face was quite pale -LRB-with passion, Alice thought-RRB-, and it said in a low trembling voice, <div class="bookquote">`Let us get to the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious creatures.
Do come back again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't like them!' Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the shore.
A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and uncomfortable.
The first question of course was, how to get dry again: they had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had known them all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life.
Indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, <div class="bookquote">`I am older than you, and must know better' (<font color='red'><b>the Lory</b></font>)</div>; and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was, and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no more to be said.
At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them, called out, <div class="bookquote">`Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!
CHAPTER III. I'LL soon make you dry enough!'  (<font color='red'><b>a person</b></font>)</div>They all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the Mouse in the middle.
Alice kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would catch a bad cold if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not get dry very soon. <div class="bookquote">`
Ahem!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Mouse with an important air, <div class="bookquote">`are you all ready? This is the driest thing I know. Silence all round, if you please! ''
William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.
Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--'''  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Ugh!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Lory</b></font>)</div>said the Lory, with a shiver. <div class="bookquote">` I beg your pardon!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Lory</b></font>)</div>said the Mouse, frowning, but very politely: <div class="bookquote">`Did you speak?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse frowning</b></font>)</div>Edwin and Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edwin</b></font>): and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found it advisable--''' <div class="bookquote">`Found WHAT?'  (<font color='red'><b>the archbishop</b></font>)</div>said the Duck. <div class="bookquote">`
Found IT,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duck</b></font>)</div>the Mouse replied rather crossly: <div class="bookquote">`of course you know what ``it'' means.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I know what ``it'' means well enough, when I find a thing,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>said the Duck: `it's generally a frog or a worm.
<div class="bookquote">` Not I!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duck frog</b></font>)</div>said the Lory hastily. <div class="bookquote">` I thought you did,'  (<font color='red'><b>Lory</b></font>)</div>said the Mouse. <div class="bookquote">` --I proceed. '' The question is, what did the archbishop find?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on, <div class="bookquote">` ''--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William and offer him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) the crown.
William's conduct at first was moderate. But the insolence of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) Normans--'' How are you getting on now, my dear?'  (<font color='red'><b>The Mouse</b></font>)</div>it continued, turning to Alice as it spoke. <div class="bookquote">`
In that case,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, <div class="bookquote">`I move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more energetic remedies--'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Speak English!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Eaglet. <div class="bookquote">`
As wet as ever,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice in a melancholy tone: <div class="bookquote">`it doesn't seem to dry me at all.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I don't know the meaning of half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do either!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone, <div class="bookquote">`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wanted much to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything. `
And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile: some of the other birds tittered audibly. ` <div class="bookquote">` Why,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Dodo, <div class="bookquote">`the best way to explain it is to do it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>-LRB-And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.-RRB-
First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, -LRB-`the exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,-RRB- and then all the party were placed along the course, here and there.
There was no <div class="bookquote">`One, two, three, and away,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but they began running when they liked, and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know when the race was over.
However, when they had been running half an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called out <div class="bookquote">`The race is over!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)</div>This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead -LRB-the position in which you usually see Shakespeare, in the pictures of him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)-RRB-, while the rest waited in silence.
and they all crowded round it, panting, and asking, <div class="bookquote">`But who has won?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>At last the Dodo said, <div class="bookquote">`EVERYBODY has won, and all must have prizes.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Why, SHE, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), calling out in a confused way, <div class="bookquote">`Prizes!
Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, -LRB-luckily the salt water had not got into it-RRB-, and handed them round as prizes.
But who is to give the prizes?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>quite a chorus of voices asked. <div class="bookquote">` Prizes!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There was exactly one a-piece all round. <div class="bookquote">`
But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) must have a prize herself, you know,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>said the Mouse. <div class="bookquote">` Of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>the Dodo replied very gravely. <div class="bookquote">`
What else have you got in your pocket?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on, turning to Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Only a thimble,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice sadly. `
Then they all crowded round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) once more, while the Dodo solemnly presented the thimble, saying <div class="bookquote">`We beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble' (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.
Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not dare to laugh; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not think of anything to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could.
The next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
However, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more. <div class="bookquote">`
Hand it over here,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>said the Dodo. You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice, <div class="bookquote">`and why it is you
hate--C and D ,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) added in a whisper, half afraid that it would be offended again. <div class="bookquote">` Mine is a long and a sad tale!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Mouse, turning to Alice, and sighing. <div class="bookquote">`
It IS a long tail, certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, looking down with wonder at the Mouse's tail; <div class="bookquote">`but why do you call it sad?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) idea of the tale was something like this:-- <div class="bookquote">`
``Let us both go to law: I will prosecute YOU.--Come, I'll take no denial; We must have a trial: For really this morning I've nothing to do.
'' Said the mouse to the cur, ``Such a trial, dear Sir, With no jury or judge, would be wasting our breath.''
Fury said to a mouse, That he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) met in the house, ``I'll be judge, I'll be jury,'' Said cunning old Fury: ``I'll try the whole cause, and condemn you to death.
'''  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You are not attending!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>said the Mouse to Alice severely. <div class="bookquote">` What are you thinking of?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I beg your pardon,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice very humbly: <div class="bookquote">`you had got to the fifth bend, I think?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I had NOT!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily. <div class="bookquote">` A knot!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking anxiously about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
Oh, do let me help to undo it!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I shall do nothing of the sort,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div>said the Mouse, getting up and walking away. <div class="bookquote">`
You insult me by talking such nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I didn't mean it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>pleaded poor Alice. <div class="bookquote">` But you're so easily offended, you know!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>The Mouse only growled in reply. <div class="bookquote">` Please come back and finish your story!'  (<font color='red'><b>The Mouse</b></font>)</div>Alice called after it; and the others all joined in chorus, <div class="bookquote">`Yes, please do!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lory</b></font>) daughter `Ah, my dear!
but the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker. <div class="bookquote">` Let this be a lesson to you never to lose YOUR temper!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue, Ma!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the young Crab, a little snappishly. <div class="bookquote">` You're enough to try the patience of an oyster!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I wish I had our Dinah here , I know I do!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice aloud, addressing nobody in particular. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'d soon fetch it back!'
 (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Lory</b></font>)</div>said the Lory. Alice replied eagerly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was always ready to talk about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pet: <div class="bookquote">`Dinah's our cat.
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s such a capital one for catching mice you can't think! And oh, I wish you could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) after the birds!
Why, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'ll eat a little bird as soon as look at it!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
Some of the birds hurried off at once: one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, <div class="bookquote">`I really must be getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!'
 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>and a Canary called out in a trembling voice to its children, <div class="bookquote">`Come away, my dears! It's high time you were all in bed!'
 (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>On various pretexts they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone. <div class="bookquote">` I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself in a melancholy tone. <div class="bookquote">`
Nobody seems to like her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), down here, and I'm sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s the best cat in the world! Oh, my dear Dinah!
I wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And here poor Alice began to cry again, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt very lonely and low-spirited.
In a little while, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked up eagerly, half hoping that the Mouse had changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mind, and was coming back to finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) story.
It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!
CHAPTER IV. The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill The Duchess! Oh my dear paws! Oh my fur and whiskers! She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)'ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!
Alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and the little door, had vanished completely.
Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went hunting about, and called out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in an angry tone, <div class="bookquote">`Why, Mary Ann, what ARE you doing out here?
Where CAN I have dropped them, I wonder?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan!
And Alice was so much frightened that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without trying to explain the mistake it had made. <div class="bookquote">`
Quick, now!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) took me for his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) housemaid,' she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) said to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) ran. ` How surprised he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>)'ll be when he (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) finds out who I am!
As she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) came upon a neat little house, on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name <div class="bookquote">`W. RABBIT'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>engraved upon it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) went in without knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) should meet the real Mary Ann, and be turned out of the house before she (<font color='blue'><b>Ann</b></font>) had found the fan and gloves. <div class="bookquote">`
But I'd better take him (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>fan</b></font>) fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'  (<font color='red'><b>the fan gloves</b></font>)</div>How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, <div class="bookquote">`to be going messages for a rabbit!
I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on messages next!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: <div class="bookquote">```Miss Alice!
Come here directly, and get ready for your walk!'' ``Coming in a minute, nurse! But I've got to see that the mouse doesn't get out.
Only I don't think,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice went on, <div class="bookquote">`that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>By this time she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) way into a tidy little room with a table in the window, and on it -LRB-as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had hoped-RRB- a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) took up the fan and a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-glass.
There was no label this time with the words <div class="bookquote">`DRINK ME,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>but nevertheless she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) uncorked it and put it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) lips. <div class="bookquote">`
I know SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this bottle does.
'' I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It did so indeed, and much sooner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had expected: before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) had drunk half the bottle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) head pressing against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) neck from being broken.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself <div class="bookquote">`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so much!'
 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went on growing, and growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor: in another minute there was not even room for this, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the other arm curled round her (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) head.
Still she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) went on growing, and, as a last resource, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dinah</b></font>) put one arm out of the window, and one foot up the chimney, and said to herself <div class="bookquote">`Now I can do no more, whatever happens.
Alas! it was too late to wish that! What WILL become of me?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full effect, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) grew no larger
: still it was very uncomfortable, and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ever getting out of the room again, no wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt unhappy. <div class="bookquote">`
It was much pleasanter at home,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought poor Alice, <div class="bookquote">`when one wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about by mice and rabbits.
I almost wish I hadn't gone down that rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know, this sort of life! I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!
There ought to be a book written about me, that there ought! And when I grow up, I'll write one-- but I'm grown up now,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) added in a sorrowful tone; <div class="bookquote">`at least there's no room to grow up any more HERE.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But then,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought Alice, <div class="bookquote">`shall I NEVER get any older than I am now?
That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--but then--always to have lessons to learn! Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh, you foolish Alice!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answered herself. <div class="bookquote">` How can you learn lessons in here? Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no room at all for any lesson-books!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and then the other, and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen. <div class="bookquote">`
And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on, taking first one side Mary Ann! Mary Ann!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the voice. <div class="bookquote">` Fetch me my gloves this moment!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) trembled till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shook the house, quite forgetting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no reason to be afraid of it.
Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it; but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.
Then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs. Alice heard it say to itself <div class="bookquote">` Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard the Rabbit just under the window, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) suddenly spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, and made a snatch in the air.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not get hold of anything, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard a little shriek and a fall, and a crash of broken glass, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something of the sort.
<div class="bookquote">` Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat! Where are you?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And then a voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never heard before, <div class="bookquote">`Sure then I'm here!
Digging for apples, yer honour!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Digging for apples, indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Rabbit</b></font>)</div>said the Rabbit angrily. <div class="bookquote">` Here! Come and help me out of THIS!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Rabbit</b></font>)</div>-LRB-Sounds of more broken glass.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">` Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-LRB-He (<font color='blue'><b>Pat</b></font>) pronounced it <div class="bookquote">`arrum.' (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>-RRB- <div class="bookquote">` An arm, you goose! Who ever saw one that size? Why, it fills the whole window!'
 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Sure, it does, yer honour: but it's an arm for all that.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well, it's got no business there, at any rate: go and take it away!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear whispers now and then; such as, <div class="bookquote">`Sure, I don't like it, yer honour, at all, at all!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Do as I tell you, you coward!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spread out her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand again, and made another snatch in the air.
This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more sounds of broken glass. <div class="bookquote">` What a number of cucumber-frames there must be!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>thought Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
I wonder what they'll do next! As for pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD! I'm sure I don't want to stay in here any longer!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waited for some time without hearing anything more: at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a good many voices all talking together
: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made out the words: <div class="bookquote">`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one; Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up at this corner--
No, tie 'em together first --they don't reach half high enough yet-- Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular-- Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--
Will the roof bear?--Mind that loose slate-- Oh, it's coming down! Heads below!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LRB-a loud crash-RRB---`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--
Who's to go down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't, then!--Bill's to go down-- Here, Bill! the master says you're to go down the chimney!'
<div class="bookquote">` Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)?'  (<font color='red'><b>the master</b></font>)</div>said Alice to herself. <div class="bookquote">` Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal: this fireplace is narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) foot as far down the chimney as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, and waited till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard a little animal -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) couldn't guess of what sort it was-RRB- scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>):
then, saying to herself <div class="bookquote">`This is Bill,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave one sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next. The first thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard was a general chorus of <div class="bookquote">`
There goes Bill!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>), you by the hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold up his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) head--Brandy now--
Don't choke him (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>)-- How was it, old fellow? What happened to you? Tell us all about it!' Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, -LRB-'
; I'm better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes like a sky-rocket!'
That's Bill,' thought Alice,-RRB- ` Well, I hardly know-- No more, thank ye <div class="bookquote">` So you did, old fellow!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the others. <div class="bookquote">`
We must burn the house down!'  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>said the Rabbit's voice; and Alice called out as loud as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, <div class="bookquote">`If you do.
I'll set Dinah at you!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!
After a minute or two, they began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, <div class="bookquote">`A barrowful will do, to begin with.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Rabbit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
A barrowful of WHAT?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Rabbit</b></font>)</div>thought Alice; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not long to doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in the face. <div class="bookquote">`
If they had any sense, they'd take the roof off.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>I'll put a stop to this,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, and shouted out, <div class="bookquote">`You'd better not do that again!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright idea came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head. <div class="bookquote">`
If I eat one of these cakes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">`it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I suppose.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which produced another dead silence. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began shrinking directly.
As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was small enough to get through the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran out of the house, and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.
The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) appeared; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran off as hard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, and soon found herself safe in a thick wood. <div class="bookquote">`
The first thing I've got to do,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Alice to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again; and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not the smallest idea how to set about it; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was peering about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) look up in a great hurry.
An enormous puppy was looking down at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) with large round eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
Poor little thing!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried hard to whistle to it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it would be very likely to eat her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) up in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) coaxing.
Hardly knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) picked up a little bit of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) escape; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set off at once, and ran till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite tired and out of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the distance. `
said Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself with one of the leaves: <div class="bookquote">`I should have liked teaching it tricks very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!
I think that will be the best plan.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' Oh dear! I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!
Let me see--how IS it to be managed? I suppose I ought to eat or drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'
Alice looked all round her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances.
There was a large mushroom growing near her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), about the same height as herself; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might as well look and see what was on the top of it.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of the mushroom, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes immediately met those of a large caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded, quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) or of anything else.
The great question certainly was, what? CHAPTER V. Advice from a Caterpillar The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence:
at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in a languid, sleepy voice. <div class="bookquote">` Who are YOU?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar.
Alice replied, rather shyly, <div class="bookquote">`I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. <div class="bookquote">`What do you mean by that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar sternly. <div class="bookquote">` Explain yourself!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I can't explain MYSELF , I'm afraid, sir'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">`because I'm not myself, you see.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I don't see,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar. <div class="bookquote">`
I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>Alice replied very politely, <div class="bookquote">`for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">`but when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll feel it a little queer, won't you?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>It isn't,' said the Caterpillar. ` <div class="bookquote">`Not a bit,'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar. <div class="bookquote">` Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">` Who are YOU?'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation.
Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) drew herself up and said, very gravely, <div class="bookquote">`I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) turned away. `
<div class="bookquote">`Why?'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar. Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">` I've something important to say!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again. <div class="bookquote">`
Keep your temper,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar. <div class="bookquote">` Is that all?'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said Alice, swallowing down her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) anger as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could. `
Alice thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might as well wait, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) something worth hearing.
For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, <div class="bookquote">`So you think you're changed, do you?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
I'm afraid I am, sir,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">`I can't remember things as I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>No,' said the Caterpillar. <div class="bookquote">`Can't remember WHAT things?'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar. <div class="bookquote">` Well, I've tried to say ``HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE,'' but it all came different!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>Alice replied in a very melancholy voice. <div class="bookquote">` Repeat, ``YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar. Alice folded her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands, and began:-- <div class="bookquote">`
You are old, Father William,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the young man said, <div class="bookquote">`And your hair has become very white; And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
Do you think, at your age, it is right?'  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`In my youth,'  (<font color='red'><b>Father</b></font>)</div>Father William replied to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">`I feared it might injure the brain;
But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none, Why, I do it again and again.'  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You are old,'  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>said the youth, <div class="bookquote">`as I mentioned before, And have grown most uncommonly fat;
, what is the reason of that?'  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`In my youth,'  (<font color='red'><b>the sage</b></font>)</div>said the sage, as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) grey locks, <div class="bookquote">`I kept all my limbs very supple
Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door-- Pray By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box-- Allow me to sell you a couple?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
You are old,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the youth, <div class="bookquote">`and your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet; Yet you finished the goose, with
the bones and the beak-- Pray how did you manage to do it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`In my youth,'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father, <div class="bookquote">`I took to the law, And argued each case with my wife;
You are old,'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said the youth, <div class="bookquote">`one would hardly suppose That your eye was as steady as ever; Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw, Has lasted the rest of my life.'  (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What made you so awfully clever?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the youth</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Said his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father; <div class="bookquote">`don't give yourself airs! Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`That is not said right,'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar. <div class="bookquote">` Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said Alice, timidly; <div class="bookquote">`some of the words have got altered.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`It is wrong from beginning to end,'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes. The Caterpillar was the first to speak. <div class="bookquote">`
Oh, I'm not particular as to size,'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>Alice hastily replied; <div class="bookquote">`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I DON'T know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar.
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never been so much contradicted in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) temper. <div class="bookquote">`
What size do you want to be?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>it asked. <div class="bookquote">` Alice said nothing: Are you content now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar. <div class="bookquote">`
Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you wouldn't mind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>said Alice: <div class="bookquote">`three inches is such a wretched height to be.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke -LRB-it was exactly three inches high-RRB-. `
<div class="bookquote">` But I'm not used to it!'  (<font color='red'><b>Caterpillar</b></font>)</div>pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought of herself, <div class="bookquote">`I wish the creatures wouldn't be so easily offended!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.
Then it got down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely remarking as it went, <div class="bookquote">`One side will make you grow taller, and the other side will make you grow shorter.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>`
<div class="bookquote">` This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. One side of WHAT? The other side of WHAT?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>thought Alice to herself. <div class="bookquote">`
Of the mushroom,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Caterpillar, just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.
Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found this a very difficult question.
However, at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stretched her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand. `
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt a violent blow underneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chin: it had struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) foot!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that there was no time to be lost, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was shrinking rapidly; so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) chin was pressed so closely against her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) foot, that there was hardly room to open her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) mouth; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * <div class="bookquote">`Come, my head's free at last!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could see, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
And now which is which?'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>* What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. ` And where HAVE my shoulders got to?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was moving them about as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.
As there seemed to be no chance of getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head down to them, and was delighted to find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face, and was beating her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) violently with its wings. <div class="bookquote">`
And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon. <div class="bookquote">` I'm NOT a serpent!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div>said Alice indignantly. `
repeated the Pigeon, but in a more subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, <div class="bookquote">`I've tried every way, and nothing seems to suit them!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div>Let me alone!' <div class="bookquote">` Serpent, I say again!'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've tried hedges,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Pigeon went on, without attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); `but those serpents!
Alice was more and more puzzled, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought there was no use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished. <div class="bookquote">`
There's no pleasing them!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div>As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the Pigeon; <div class="bookquote">` but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and day!
Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, who was beginning to see its meaning. <div class="bookquote">`
And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>continued the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, <div class="bookquote">`and just as I was thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come wriggling down from the sky!
Ugh, Serpent!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` I'm a--I'm a--'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Well! WHAT are you?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div>said the Pigeon. <div class="bookquote">`
I--I'm a little girl,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div>said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered the number of changes she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had gone through that day. <div class="bookquote">`
I can see you're trying to invent something!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` A likely story indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div>said the Pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt. <div class="bookquote">`
I've seen a good many little girls in my time, but never ONE with such a neck as that! No, no!
You're a serpent; and there's no use denying it. I suppose you'll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, who was a very truthful child; <div class="bookquote">`but little girls eat eggs quite as much as serpents do, you know.'
 (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I don't believe it,'  (<font color='red'><b>a child</b></font>)</div>said the Pigeon; <div class="bookquote">`but if they do, why then they're a kind of serpent , that's all I can say.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div>This was such a new idea to Alice, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite silent for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of adding, <div class="bookquote">`You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a serpent?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
It matters a good deal to ME,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div>said Alice hastily; <div class="bookquote">` but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS
: I don't like them raw.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Well, be off, then!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Pigeon</b></font>)</div>said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.
Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now
After a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remembered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) still held the pieces of mushroom in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had succeeded in bringing herself down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) usual height.
It was so long since she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. <div class="bookquote">`
and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had to stop and untwist it. Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are!
However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be done, I wonder?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. <div class="bookquote">`
I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another! Whoever lives there,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought Alice, `it'll never do to come upon them
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had brought herself down to nine inches high.
For a minute or two she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood looking at the house, and wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the wood---LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) considered him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) to be a footman because he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) was in livery
: otherwise, judging by his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) face only, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would have called him (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) a fish-RRB---and rapped loudly at the door with his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) knuckles.
It was opened by another footman in livery, with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen, Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their heads.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt very curious to know what it was all about, and crept a little way out of the wood to listen.
The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) arm a great letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he (<font color='blue'><b>footman</b></font>) handed over to the other, saying, in a solemn tone, <div class="bookquote">`For the Duchess.
THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VI. Pig and Pepper An invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'
The Frog-Footman repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the words a little, <div class="bookquote">`From the Queen. An invitation for the Duchess to play croquet.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice laughed so much at this, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>); and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) next peeped out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.
Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled together. Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked. <div class="bookquote">`
First, because I'm on the same side of the door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise inside, no one could possibly hear you.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>And certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces. <div class="bookquote">`
Please, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">`how am I to get in?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`There might be some sense in your knocking,'  (<font color='red'><b>Footman</b></font>)</div>the Footman went on without attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`if we had the door between us.
There's no sort of use in knocking,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said the Footman, <div class="bookquote">`and that for two reasons. For instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let you out, you know.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Footman</b></font>)</div>But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>) can't help it,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself; `his (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>) eyes are so VERY nearly at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>) head.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>) was looking up into the sky all the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>) was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil. <div class="bookquote">` But at any rate he (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>) might answer questions.--How am I to get in?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, 'till tomorrow--' At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head: it just grazed his (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>) nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>). `
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) repeated, aloud. <div class="bookquote">` --or next day, maybe,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the Footman continued in the same tone, exactly as if nothing had happened. <div class="bookquote">`
How am I to get in?'  (<font color='red'><b>Footman</b></font>)</div>asked Alice again, in a louder tone. <div class="bookquote">`ARE you to get in at all?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Footman. <div class="bookquote">`
That's the first question, you know.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It was, no doubt: only Alice did not like to be told so. <div class="bookquote">` It's really dreadful,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) muttered to herself, <div class="bookquote">`the way all the creatures argue.
It's enough to drive one crazy!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remark, with variations. <div class="bookquote">`
I shall sit here,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`on and off, for days and days.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But what am I to do?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
Anything you like,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Footman, and began whistling. <div class="bookquote">` Oh, there's no use in talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Footman</b></font>)</div>said Alice desperately: <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Footman</b></font>)'s perfectly idiotic!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of smoke from one end to the other: the Duchess was sitting on a three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup. <div class="bookquote">`
And she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) opened the door and went in. There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!'  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>Alice said to herself, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could for sneezing.
There was certainly too much of it in the air. Even the Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.
The only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook, and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear. <div class="bookquote">`
Please would you tell me,'  (<font color='red'><b>a cat</b></font>)</div>said Alice, a little timidly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to speak first, <div class="bookquote">`why your cat grins like that?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>`
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw in another moment that it was addressed to the baby, and not to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) took courage, and went on again:-- <div class="bookquote">`
It's a Cheshire cat,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess, <div class="bookquote">`and that's why. Pig!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I didn't know that cats COULD grin.' <div class="bookquote">`
I don't know of any that do,'  (<font color='red'><b>cats</b></font>)</div>Alice said very politely, feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation. <div class="bookquote">`
They all can,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess; <div class="bookquote">`and most of 'em do.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You don't know much,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess; <div class="bookquote">`and that's a fact.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation.
While she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was trying to fix on one, the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work throwing everything within her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) reach at the Duchess and the baby--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans, plates, and dishes.
The Duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>); and the baby was howling so much already, that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not. <div class="bookquote">`
Oh, there goes his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) PRECIOUS nose' (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div>; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very nearly carried it off. <div class="bookquote">`
If everybody minded their own business,'  (<font color='red'><b>Duchess</b></font>)</div>the Duchess said in a hoarse growl, <div class="bookquote">`the world would go round a deal faster than it does.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Duchess</b></font>)</div>Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knowledge. <div class="bookquote">`
Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>cried Alice, jumping up and down in an agony of terror. ` <div class="bookquote">` Just think of what work it would make with the day and night!
You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn round on its axis--'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Talking of axes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess, <div class="bookquote">`chop off her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) head!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) meant to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and seemed not to be listening, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on again: `Twenty-four hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?
And with that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) child again, singing a sort of lullaby to it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did so, and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line: <div class="bookquote">`Speak roughly to your little boy, And beat him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sneezes
I--'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh, don't bother ME,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess; <div class="bookquote">`I never could abide figures!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>: He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) only does it to annoy, Because he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) knows it teases.'
While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) kept tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:-- <div class="bookquote">`
I speak severely to my boy, I beat him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sneezes; For he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) can thoroughly enjoy The pepper when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) pleases!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>CHORUS. -LRB-In which the cook and the baby joined-RRB-:-- <div class="bookquote">`Wow! wow! wow!'  (<font color='red'><b>the baby</b></font>)</div>CHORUS. <div class="bookquote">` Wow! wow! wow!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Duchess</b></font>)</div>the Duchess said to Alice, flinging the baby at her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">` I must go and get ready to play croquet with the Queen,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) hurried out of the room.
Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all directions, <div class="bookquote">`just like a star-fish,'  (<font color='red'><b>a creature</b></font>)</div>thought Alice.
The poor little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) caught it, and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again, so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could do to hold it.
As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had made out the proper way of nursing it, -LRB-which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its undoing itself,-RRB- she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) carried it out into the open air. <div class="bookquote">`
IF I don't take this child away with me,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought Alice, <div class="bookquote">`they're sure to kill it in a day or two: wouldn't it be murder to leave it behind?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said the last words out loud, and the little thing grunted in reply -LRB-it had left off sneezing by this time-RRB-. <div class="bookquote">`
The cook threw a frying-pan after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went out, but it just missed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). Don't grunt,'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">`that's not at all a proper way of expressing yourself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>There could be no doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby: altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at all. <div class="bookquote">`
But perhaps it was only sobbing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, and looked into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.
The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it. No, there were no tears. <div class="bookquote">`
If you're going to turn into a pig, my dear,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do with you.
The poor little thing sobbed again -LRB-or grunted, it was impossible to say which-RRB-, and they went on for some while in silence.
Alice was just beginning to think to herself, <div class="bookquote">`Now, what am I to do with this creature when I get it home?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>This time there could be NO mistake about it: it was neither more nor less than a pig, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that it would be quite absurd for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to carry it further.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood. <div class="bookquote">`
If it had grown up,'  (<font color='red'><b>the creature</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">`it would have made a dreadfully ugly child: but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began thinking over other children she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew, who might do very well as pigs, and was just saying to herself, <div class="bookquote">`if one only knew the right way to change them--'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a little startled by seeing the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.
Mind now!' when it grunted again, so violently, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked down into its face in some alarm. The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.
It looked good-natured, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought: still it had VERY long claws and a great many teeth, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt that it ought to be treated with respect. `
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not at all know whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little wider. <div class="bookquote">`
Cheshire Puss,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began, rather timidly, Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on. <div class="bookquote">` Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>said the Cat. <div class="bookquote">` I don't much care where--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
Then it doesn't matter which way you go,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Cat. <div class="bookquote">` --so long as I get SOMEWHERE,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>Alice added as an explanation. <div class="bookquote">`
Oh, you're sure to do that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Cat, <div class="bookquote">`if you only walk long enough.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tried another question. `
<div class="bookquote">`In THAT direction,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>the Cat said, waving its right paw round, <div class="bookquote">`lives a Hatter: and in THAT direction,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>waving the other paw, <div class="bookquote">`lives a March Hare.
What sort of people live about here?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>Visit either you like: they're both mad.' <div class="bookquote">` But I don't want to go among mad people,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice remarked. <div class="bookquote">`
Oh, you can't help that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Cat: <div class="bookquote">`we're all mad here. I'm mad. You're mad.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` How do you know I'm mad?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
You must be,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Cat, <div class="bookquote">`or you wouldn't have come here.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on <div class="bookquote">`
And how do you know that you're mad?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`To begin with,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>said the Cat, <div class="bookquote">`a dog's not mad. You grant that?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I suppose so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
Well, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Cat went on, <div class="bookquote">`you see, a dog growls when it's angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.
Now I growl when I'm pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry. Therefore I'm mad.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I call it purring, not growling,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
Do you play croquet with the Queen to-day?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I should like it very much,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">`but I haven't been invited yet.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Call it what you like,' said the Cat. ` <div class="bookquote">` You'll see me there,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>said the Cat, and vanished. Alice was not much surprised at this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was getting so used to queer things happening.
While she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was looking at the place where it had been, it suddenly appeared again. <div class="bookquote">` By-the-bye, what became of the baby?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Cat.
<div class="bookquote">` I'd nearly forgotten to ask.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It turned into a pig,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice quietly said, just as if it had come back in a natural way. `
Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not appear, and after a minute or two she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked on in the direction in which the March Hare was said to live. <div class="bookquote">`
I've seen hatters before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself; <div class="bookquote">`the March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is
I thought it would,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Cat, and vanished again. May it won't be raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'
As she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a branch of a tree. <div class="bookquote">`
I said pig,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>replied Alice; <div class="bookquote">`and I wish you wouldn't keep appearing and vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly, beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which remained some time after the rest of it had gone. <div class="bookquote">`
Did you say pig, or fig?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat time</b></font>)</div>said the Cat. ` <div class="bookquote">` Well! I've often seen a cat without a grin,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>thought Alice; `but a grin without a cat!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not gone much farther before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came in sight of the house of the March Hare: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought it must be the right house, because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur.
It was so large a house, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not like to go nearer till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high: even then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself <div class="bookquote">`Suppose it should be raving mad after all!
It's the most curious thing I ever saw in my life!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I almost wish I'd gone to see the Hatter instead!'
There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:
a Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. <div class="bookquote">`
CHAPTER VII. A Mad Tea-Party Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,'  (<font color='red'><b>a Dormouse</b></font>)</div>thought Alice; <div class="bookquote">`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it: <div class="bookquote">`No room! No room!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>they cried out when they saw Alice coming. <div class="bookquote">` There's PLENTY of room!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice indignantly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. <div class="bookquote">`
Have some wine,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the March Hare said in an encouraging tone. Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it
but tea. <div class="bookquote">` I don't see any wine,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remarked. <div class="bookquote">` There isn't any,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the March Hare. <div class="bookquote">` Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>said Alice angrily. <div class="bookquote">`
It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being invited,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the March Hare. <div class="bookquote">` I didn't know it was YOUR table,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">`it's laid for a great many more than three.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Your hair wants cutting,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) first speech. `
The Hatter opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) SAID was, <div class="bookquote">`Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
You should learn not to make personal remarks,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Alice said with some severity; <div class="bookquote">`it's very rude.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.
<div class="bookquote">` I'm glad they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) added aloud. <div class="bookquote">` Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the March Hare. <div class="bookquote">`
Exactly so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Then you should say what you mean,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the March Hare went on. <div class="bookquote">` I do,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>Alice hastily replied; <div class="bookquote">`at least--
at least I mean what I say--that's the same thing, you know.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Not the same thing a bit!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter. <div class="bookquote">`
You might just as well say that ``I see what I eat'' is the same thing as ``I eat what I see''!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
You might just as well say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>added the March Hare, <div class="bookquote">`that ``I like what I get'' is the same thing as ``I get what I like''!'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
You might just as well say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>added the Dormouse, who seemed to be talking in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) sleep, <div class="bookquote">`that ``I breathe when I sleep'' is the same thing as ``I sleep when I breathe''!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
It IS the same thing with you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter, and here the conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while Alice thought over all she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could remember about ravens and writing-desks, which wasn't much.
he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) said, turning to Alice: he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) had taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) watch out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then, and holding it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) ear.
The Hatter was the first to break the silence. <div class="bookquote">` What day of the month is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>The Hatter</b></font>)</div>Alice considered a little, and then said <div class="bookquote">`The fourth.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Two days wrong!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>sighed the Hatter. <div class="bookquote">` I told you butter wouldn't suit the works!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) added looking angrily at the March Hare. <div class="bookquote">`
Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>the Hatter grumbled: <div class="bookquote">`you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Hatter</b></font>)</div>The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) dipped it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) could think of nothing better to say than his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) first remark, <div class="bookquote">`It was the BEST butter, you know.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied. ` Alice had been looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) shoulder with some curiosity. <div class="bookquote">`
What a funny watch!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) remarked. <div class="bookquote">` It tells the day of the month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Of course not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice replied very readily: <div class="bookquote">`but that's because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why should it?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>muttered the Hatter. <div class="bookquote">` Does YOUR watch tell you what year it is?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Which is just the case with MINE,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter.
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled. The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. <div class="bookquote">`
I don't quite understand you,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Hatter</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hatter</b></font>) said, as politely as she (<font color='blue'><b>Hatter</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">` The Dormouse is asleep again,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) poured a little hot tea upon its nose.
The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its eyes, <div class="bookquote">`Of course, of course; just what I was going to remark myself.'
 (<font color='red'><b>The Dormouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Have you guessed the riddle yet?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>the Hatter said, turning to Alice again. <div class="bookquote">` No, I give it up,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice replied: <div class="bookquote">`what's the answer?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
I think you might do something better with the time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">`than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter. <div class="bookquote">` Nor I,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the March Hare. Alice sighed wearily. ` <div class="bookquote">`If you knew Time as well as I do,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter, <div class="bookquote">`you wouldn't talk about wasting IT.
It's HIM.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I don't know what you mean,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Of course you don't!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Hatter said, tossing his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) head contemptuously. <div class="bookquote">`
I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'  (<font color='red'><b>Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Perhaps not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice cautiously replied: <div class="bookquote">` but I know I have to beat time when I learn music.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Ah! that accounts for it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter. <div class="bookquote">` He (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) won't stand beating. Now, if you only kept on good terms with him (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>)'d do almost anything you liked with the clock.
For instance, suppose it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons: you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling!
-LRB-' (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a whisper.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`That would be grand, certainly,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice thoughtfully: <div class="bookquote">`
Half-past one, time for dinner!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.' <div class="bookquote">` Not at first, perhaps,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter: <div class="bookquote">`
but you could keep it to half-past one as long as you liked.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Is that the way YOU manage?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>Alice asked.
We quarrelled last March--just before HE (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) went mad, you know--' -LRB-pointing with his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) tea spoon at the March Hare,-RRB- `--it was at the great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing ``Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
The Hatter shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) head mournfully. <div class="bookquote">` Not I!'  (<font color='red'><b>The Hatter</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">` How I wonder what you're at! '' You know the song, perhaps?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I've heard something like it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
It goes on, you know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Hatter continued, <div class="bookquote">`in this way:-- ``Up above the world you fly, Like a tea-tray in the sky.
Twinkle, twinkle--'''  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep <div class="bookquote">`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>and went on so long that they had to pinch it to make it stop. <div class="bookquote">`
Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter, <div class="bookquote">`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, ``He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)'s murdering the time!
Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head!'''  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`How dreadfully savage!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alice. <div class="bookquote">` And ever since that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Hatter went on in a mournful tone, <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) won't do a thing I ask!
It's always six o'clock now.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>A bright idea came into Alice's head. <div class="bookquote">` Is that the reason so many tea-things are put out here?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh: <div class="bookquote">`it's always tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hatter</b></font>) asked. ` <div class="bookquote">` Then you keep moving round, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Exactly so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter: <div class="bookquote">`as the things get used up.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But what happens when you come to the beginning again?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>Alice ventured to ask. <div class="bookquote">` Suppose we change the subject,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the March Hare interrupted, yawning. <div class="bookquote">`
I'm getting tired of this. I vote the young lady tells us a story.'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I'm afraid I don't know one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, rather alarmed at the proposal. <div class="bookquote">`
Then the Dormouse shall!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>they both cried. <div class="bookquote">` Wake up, Dormouse!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And they pinched it on both sides at once. The Dormouse slowly opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) eyes. <div class="bookquote">`
I wasn't asleep,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Dormouse</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) said in a hoarse, feeble voice: <div class="bookquote">`I heard every word you fellows were saying.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Tell us a story!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>said the March Hare. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, please do!'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>pleaded Alice. <div class="bookquote">` And be quick about it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>added the Hatter, <div class="bookquote">`or you'll be asleep again before it's done.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Once upon a time there were three little sisters,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>the Dormouse began in a great hurry; <div class="bookquote">`and their names were Elsie, Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
What did they live on?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>said Alice, who always took a great interest in questions of eating and drinking. <div class="bookquote">` They lived on treacle,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Dormouse, after thinking a minute or two. <div class="bookquote">`
They couldn't have done that, you know,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>Alice gently remarked; <div class="bookquote">`they'd have been ill.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` So they were,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Dormouse; <div class="bookquote">`VERY ill.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of living would be like, but it puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) too much, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on: <div class="bookquote">`
But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Take some more tea,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>the March Hare said to Alice, very earnestly. <div class="bookquote">`
I've had nothing yet,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice replied in an offended tone, <div class="bookquote">`so I can't take more.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You mean you can't take LESS,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter: <div class="bookquote">`it's very easy to take MORE than nothing.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>`
Alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) helped herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the Dormouse, and repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) question. <div class="bookquote">`
Nobody asked YOUR opinion,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Who's making personal remarks now?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Hatter asked triumphantly. Why did they live at the bottom of a well?'
The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then said, <div class="bookquote">`It was a treacle-well.'  (<font color='red'><b>The Dormouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` There's no such thing!'
 (<font color='red'><b>The Dormouse</b></font>)</div>Alice was beginning very angrily, but the Hatter and the March Hare went <div class="bookquote">` Sh! sh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>and the Dormouse sulkily remarked, <div class="bookquote">`If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the story for yourself.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
No, please go on!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>Alice said very humbly; <div class="bookquote">`I won't interrupt again. I dare say there may be ONE.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` One, indeed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>said the Dormouse indignantly.
However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) consented to go on. <div class="bookquote">` And so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw, you know--'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What did they draw?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, quite forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) promise. <div class="bookquote">`
Treacle,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Dormouse, without considering at all this time. <div class="bookquote">` I want a clean cup,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>interrupted the Hatter: <div class="bookquote">`let's all move one place on.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) moved on as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) spoke, and the Dormouse followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>): the March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.
The Hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change: and Alice was a good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset the milk-jug into his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) plate.
Where did they draw the treacle from?' <div class="bookquote">`You can draw water out of a water-well,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter; <div class="bookquote">`so I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>`
Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began very cautiously: <div class="bookquote">` But I don't understand. But they were IN the well,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Alice said to the Dormouse, not choosing to notice this last remark. <div class="bookquote">`
Of course they were' (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>, said the Dormouse; <div class="bookquote">`--well in.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>This answer so confused poor Alice, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) let the Dormouse go on for some time without interrupting it. <div class="bookquote">`
They were learning to draw,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>the Dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; <div class="bookquote">`and they drew all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why with an M?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>said Alice. `
The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up again with a little shriek, and went on: <div class="bookquote">`--that begins with an M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--
you know you say things are ``much of a muchness''--did you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Why not?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the March Hare. Alice was silent. Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, <div class="bookquote">`I don't think--'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>`
This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) going, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) looked back once or twice,
half hoping that they would call after her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): the last time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) saw them, they were trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot. <div class="bookquote">`
Then you shouldn't talk,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter. At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) picked her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) way through the wood. <div class="bookquote">`
It's the stupidest tea-party I ever was at in all my life!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it. <div class="bookquote">`
That's very curious!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought. <div class="bookquote">` But everything's curious today. I think I may as well go in at once.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And in she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went.
Now, I'll manage better this time,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and unlocking the door that led into the garden.
Once more she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself in the long hall, and close to the little glass table. <div class="bookquote">` Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went to work nibbling at the mushroom
-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had kept a piece of it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pocket-RRB- till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was about a foot high: then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) walked down the little passage: and THEN--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found herself at last in the beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.
A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden: the roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at it, busily painting them red.
Alice thought this a very curious thing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went nearer to watch them, and just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came up to them
Don't go splashing paint over me like that!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I couldn't help it,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Five, in a sulky tone; <div class="bookquote">`Seven jogged my elbow.'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER VIII. The Queen's Croquet-Ground she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five! On which Seven looked up and said, <div class="bookquote">`That's right, Five!
Always lay the blame on others!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`YOU'D better not talk!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Five. <div class="bookquote">` I heard the Queen say only yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What for?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the one who had spoken first. <div class="bookquote">` That's none of YOUR business, Two!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Seven. <div class="bookquote">` Yes, it IS his (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) business!'
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Five, <div class="bookquote">`and I'll tell him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)-- it was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Seven flung down his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) brush, and had just begun <div class="bookquote">`
Well, of all the unjust things--'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>when his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood watching them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) checked himself suddenly
: the others looked round also, and all of them bowed low. <div class="bookquote">` Would you tell me,'  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>said Alice, a little timidly, <div class="bookquote">`why you are painting those roses?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Two began in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">`Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake; and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads cut off, you know.
Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two. So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) comes, to--'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>At this moment Five, who had been anxiously looking across the garden, called out <div class="bookquote">`The Queen!
The Queen!'  (<font color='red'><b>the gardeners</b></font>)</div>and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces. There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice looked round, eager to see the Queen.
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the corners:
After these came the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented with hearts.
Next came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice recognised the White Rabbit: it was talking in a hurried nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.
Alice was rather doubtful whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ought not to lie down on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face like the three gardeners, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions; <div class="bookquote">`and besides, what would be the use of a procession,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">`if people had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stood still where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was, and waited.
When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and the Queen said severely <div class="bookquote">`Who is this?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Queen</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply. <div class="bookquote">` Idiot!'  (<font color='red'><b>Hearts</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, tossing her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head impatiently; and, turning to Alice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">`What's your name, child?'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very politely; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) added, to herself, <div class="bookquote">`Why, they're only a pack of cards, after all.
And who are THESE?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) could not tell whether they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) own children.
<div class="bookquote">` I needn't be afraid of them!'  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` How should I know?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) own courage. `
The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) for a moment like a wild beast, screamed <div class="bookquote">`Off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head!
It's no business of MINE.'  (<font color='red'><b>The Queen</b></font>)</div>Off-- ` <div class="bookquote">`Nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the Queen was silent. The King laid his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hand upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arm, and timidly said <div class="bookquote">`Consider, my dear: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is only a child!'
 (<font color='red'><b>The King</b></font>)</div>The Queen turned angrily away from him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and said to the Knave <div class="bookquote">`Turn them over!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot. <div class="bookquote">`
Get up!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else. <div class="bookquote">`
Leave off that!'  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>screamed the Queen. <div class="bookquote">` You make me giddy.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>And then, turning to the rose-tree, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">`What HAVE you been doing here?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said Two, in a very humble tone, going down on one knee as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">`we were trying--'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I see!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the roses. `
and the procession moved on, three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection. <div class="bookquote">`
May it please your Majesty Off with their heads!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) put them into a large flower-pot that stood near.
The three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly marched off after the others. <div class="bookquote">`
Are their heads off?'  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>shouted the Queen. <div class="bookquote">` Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>the soldiers shouted in reply. <div class="bookquote">`
That's right!'  (<font color='red'><b>the soldiers</b></font>)</div>shouted the Queen. <div class="bookquote">` Can you play croquet?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question was evidently meant for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
Yes!'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>shouted Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Come on, then!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>roared the Queen, and Alice joined the procession, wondering very much what would happen next. <div class="bookquote">`
It's--it's a very fine day!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said a timid voice at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face. `
He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) looked anxiously over his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) shoulder as he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) spoke, and then raised himself upon tiptoe, put his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) mouth close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ear, and whispered <div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s under sentence of execution.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Very,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Alice: <div class="bookquote">`--where's the Duchess?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Hush! Hush!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone. What for?' said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
Did you say ``What a pity!''?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Rabbit asked. <div class="bookquote">` No, I didn't,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Rabbit</b></font>)</div>said Alice: <div class="bookquote">`I don't think it's at all a pity.
I said ``What for?'''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) boxed the Queen's ears--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Rabbit</b></font>)</div>the Rabbit began. Alice gave a little scream of laughter. <div class="bookquote">` Oh, hush!'
 (<font color='red'><b>a scream</b></font>)</div>You see, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) came rather late, and the Queen said--' <div class="bookquote">`Get to your places!'  (<font color='red'><b>Queen</b></font>)</div>shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder, and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or two, and the game began.
Alice thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had never seen such a curious croquet-ground in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) life; it was all ridges and furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.
The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) flamingo: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) succeeded in getting its body tucked away, comfortably enough, under her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arm, with its legs hanging down, but generally, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had got its neck nicely straightened out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it WOULD twist itself round and look up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face, with such a puzzled expression that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not help bursting out laughing: and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had got its head down, and was going to begin again, it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself, and was in the act of crawling away: besides all this, there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed.
The players all played at once without waiting for turns, quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went stamping about, and shouting <div class="bookquote">`Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>the Rabbit whispered in a frightened tone. ` The Queen will hear you! or <div class="bookquote">`Off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) head!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>about once in a minute.
Alice began to feel very uneasy: to be sure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had not as yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) knew that it might happen any minute, <div class="bookquote">`and then,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), `what would become of me?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) could get away without being seen, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) noticed a curious appearance in the air: it puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) very much at first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) made it out to be a grin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said to herself <div class="bookquote">`
They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It's the Cheshire Cat
: now I shall have somebody to talk to.' <div class="bookquote">`How are you getting on?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>said the Cat, as soon as there was mouth enough for it to speak with.
Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded. <div class="bookquote">` It's no use speaking to it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, 'till its ears have come, or at least one of them.'
In another minute the whole head appeared, and then Alice put down her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) flamingo, and began an account of the game, feeling very glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had someone to listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>).
The Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and no more of it appeared. <div class="bookquote">`
I don't think they play at all fairly,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Cat</b></font>)</div>Alice began, in rather a complaining tone, <div class="bookquote">`and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and you've no idea
how confusing it is all the things being alive; for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now
, only it ran away when it saw mine coming!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`How do you like the Queen?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>said the Cat in a low voice. <div class="bookquote">`
Not at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>said Alice: <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>)'s so extremely--'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Just then she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) noticed that the Queen was close behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), listening: so she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) went on, <div class="bookquote">`
Who ARE you talking to?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the King, going up to Alice, and looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity. <div class="bookquote">`
--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while finishing the game.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>The Queen smiled and passed on. <div class="bookquote">` It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Queen</b></font>)</div>said Alice: <div class="bookquote">`allow me to introduce it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King: <div class="bookquote">`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` I'd rather not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>the Cat remarked. <div class="bookquote">` Don't be impertinent,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Cat</b></font>)</div>said the King, <div class="bookquote">`and don't look at me like that!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) got behind Alice as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">` A cat may look at a king,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Well, it must be removed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said the King very decidedly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, <div class="bookquote">`
My dear! I wish you would have this cat removed!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great or small. <div class="bookquote">`
Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head!'  (<font color='red'><b>The Queen</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) said, without even looking round. <div class="bookquote">` I'll fetch the executioner myself,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the King eagerly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hurried off.
Alice thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might as well go back, and see how the game was going on, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) heard the Queen's voice in the distance, screaming with passion.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) had already heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in such confusion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) never knew whether it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) turn or not.
The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog, which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other: the only difficulty was, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree.
By the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had caught the flamingo and brought it back, the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight: <div class="bookquote">`but it doesn't matter much,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought Alice, <div class="bookquote">`as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tucked it away under her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for a little more conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) friend.
When she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got back to the Cheshire Cat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it: there was a dispute going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent, and looked very uncomfortable.
The moment Alice appeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was appealed to by all three to settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), though, as they all spoke at once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said.
The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a head unless there was a body to cut it off from: that he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) had never had to do such a thing before, and he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) wasn't going to begin at HIS (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) time of life.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went in search of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hedgehog. The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.
The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about it in less than no time she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>)'d have everybody executed, all round.
-LRB-It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious.-RRB- Alice could think of nothing else to say but <div class="bookquote">`
It belongs to the Duchess: you'd better ask HER about it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>)'s in prison,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Queen said to the executioner: <div class="bookquote">`fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) here.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the executioner</b></font>)</div>The Cat's head began fading away the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) was gone, and, by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>executioner</b></font>) had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.
You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old thing!' said the Duchess, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) tucked her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) arm affectionately into Alice's, and they walked off together.
Alice was very glad to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) in such a pleasant temper, and thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) so savage when they met in the kitchen. <div class="bookquote">`
When I'M a Duchess,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) said to herself, -LRB-not in a very hopeful tone though-RRB-, <div class="bookquote">`I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT ALL.
Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that makes people hot-tempered,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) went on, very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--
And the executioner went off like an arrow. CHAPTER IX. The Mock Turtle's Story <div class="bookquote">` and--and barley-sugar and such things that make children sweet-tempered.
I only wish people knew that: then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you know--'  (<font color='red'><b>The Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) voice close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) ear. <div class="bookquote">`
I can't tell you just now what the moral of that is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you forget to talk. Perhaps it hasn't one,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice ventured to remark. <div class="bookquote">`
Tut, tut, child!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess. <div class="bookquote">` Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) squeezed herself up closer to Alice's side as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) spoke.
Alice did not much like keeping so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): first, because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) was exactly the right height to rest her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) chin upon Alice's shoulder, and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.
However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not like to be rude, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) bore it as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could. <div class="bookquote">` The game's going on rather better now,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said, by way of keeping up the conversation a little. ''
Tis so,' said the Duchess: <div class="bookquote">`and the moral of that is--``Oh, 'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!'''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Somebody said,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice whispered, <div class="bookquote">`that it's done by everybody minding their own business!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess, digging her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) added, `and the moral of THAT is--``Take care of the sense, and the sounds will take care of themselves.
` Ah, well! '' ` <div class="bookquote">`How fond she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) is of finding morals in things!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice thought to herself. <div class="bookquote">` I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm
round your waist,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Duchess said after a pause: <div class="bookquote">`the reason is, that I'm doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.
Shall I try the experiment?'  (<font color='red'><b>Duchess</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`HE (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might bite,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all anxious to have the experiment tried. <div class="bookquote">`
Very true,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess: `flamingoes and mustard both bite. And the moral of that is--``Birds of a feather flock together.
'' ` <div class="bookquote">`Only mustard isn't a bird,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice remarked. <div class="bookquote">` Right, as usual,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess: <div class="bookquote">`what a clear way you have of putting things!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess way</b></font>)</div>Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near here.
<div class="bookquote">` It's a mineral, I THINK,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` And the moral of that is--``The more there is of mine, the less there is of yours.
It doesn't look like one, but it is.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I quite agree with you,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess; <div class="bookquote">`and the moral of that is--``Be what you would seem to be''--or if you'd like it put more simply--``Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise
'''  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Oh, I know!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this last remark, <div class="bookquote">`it's a vegetable. than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.
'''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I think I should understand that better,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice said very politely, <div class="bookquote">`if I had it written down: but I can't quite follow it as you say it.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Duchess replied, in a pleased tone. <div class="bookquote">` Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
Oh, don't talk about trouble!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess. <div class="bookquote">` I make you a present of everything I've said as yet.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
A cheap sort of present!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>thought Alice. <div class="bookquote">` I'm glad they don't give birthday presents like that!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did not venture to say it out loud. <div class="bookquote">`
Thinking again?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the Duchess asked, with another dig of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) sharp little chin. <div class="bookquote">` I've a right to think,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>said Alice sharply, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was beginning to feel a little worried. `
But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died away, even in the middle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) favourite word <div class="bookquote">`moral,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.
Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. <div class="bookquote">`
Just about as much right,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Duchess, <div class="bookquote">`as pigs have to fly; and the m--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess m</b></font>)</div>A fine day, your Majesty!'
Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on the ground as she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spoke; `either you or your head must be off, and that in about half no time!
the Duchess began in a low, weak voice. <div class="bookquote">` Take your choice!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Duchess</b></font>)</div>The Duchess took her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) choice, and was gone in a moment. <div class="bookquote">`
Let's go on with the game,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Duchess</b></font>)</div>the Queen said to Alice; and Alice was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) back to the croquet-ground.
The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence, and were resting in the shade: however, the moment they saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>), they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a moment's delay would cost them their lives.
All the time they were playing the Queen never left off quarrelling with the other players, and shouting <div class="bookquote">`Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the players</b></font>)</div>Those whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour
or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of execution.
Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to Alice, <div class="bookquote">`Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>`
or <div class="bookquote">`Off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>No,' said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen. <div class="bookquote">`
Come on, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, <div class="bookquote">`and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) shall tell you his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) history,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low voice, to the company generally, <div class="bookquote">`You are all pardoned.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice. ` <div class="bookquote">`Come, THAT'S a good thing!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.
-LRB-IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`Up, lazy thing!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, <div class="bookquote">`and take this young lady to see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) history.
I must go back and see after some executions I have ordered' (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) walked off, leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.
Alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage Queen: so she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) waited.
The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the Queen till she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) was out of sight: then it chuckled. <div class="bookquote">`
They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun. What fun!'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
What IS the fun?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Why, SHE,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">` It's all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) fancy, that: they never executes nobody, you know.
Everybody says ``come on!'' here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>thought Alice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went slowly after it: <div class="bookquote">`I never was so ordered about in all my life, never!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came nearer, Alice could hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) sighing as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) heart would break.
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, `It's all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) fancy, that: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) hasn't got no sorrow, you know.
So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. <div class="bookquote">`
Come on!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>` She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) pitied him (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) deeply. <div class="bookquote">` What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) sorrow?'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Come on!' This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, <div class="bookquote">`she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wants for to know your history, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) do.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I'll tell it her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow tone: <div class="bookquote">`sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've finished.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. Alice thought to herself, <div class="bookquote">`I don't see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) can EVEN finish, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) doesn't begin.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) waited patiently. <div class="bookquote">` Once,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, <div class="bookquote">`I was a real Turtle.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an occasional exclamation of <div class="bookquote">`Hjckrrh!'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>from the Gryphon, and the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.
Alice was very nearly getting up and saying, <div class="bookquote">`Thank you, sir, for your interesting story,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could not help thinking there MUST be more to come, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sat still and said nothing. <div class="bookquote">`
When we were little,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle went on at last, more calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, <div class="bookquote">`we went to school in the sea.
The master was an old Turtle--we used to call him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Tortoise--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why did you call him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Tortoise, if he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) wasn't one?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice asked. <div class="bookquote">` We called him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) Tortoise because he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) taught us,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle angrily: <div class="bookquote">`really you are very dull!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.
` At last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, <div class="bookquote">`Drive on, old fellow! Don't be all day about it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) went on in these words: <div class="bookquote">`
Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe it--'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I never said I didn't!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>interrupted Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
You did,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle. <div class="bookquote">` Hold your tongue!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak again. The Mock Turtle went on. <div class="bookquote">`
We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--'  (<font color='red'><b>The Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I'VE been to a day-school, too,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">`you needn't be so proud as all that.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` With extras?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously. <div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">`we learned French and music.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And washing?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle. <div class="bookquote">`
Certainly not!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>said Alice indignantly. <div class="bookquote">` Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle in a tone of great relief. <div class="bookquote">`
Now at OURS they had at the end of the bill, ``French, music, AND WASHING--extra. '''  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`You couldn't have wanted it much,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice; <div class="bookquote">`living at the bottom of the sea.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I couldn't afford to learn it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle with a sigh. <div class="bookquote">` I only took the regular course.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle replied; <div class="bookquote">`and then the different branches of Arithmetic--Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
What was that?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div>inquired Alice. <div class="bookquote">` I never heard of ``Uglification,'''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice ventured to say. <div class="bookquote">` What is it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. <div class="bookquote">`
What! Never heard of uglifying!'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>it exclaimed. <div class="bookquote">` You know what to beautify is, I suppose?'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice doubtfully: <div class="bookquote">`it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) turned to the Mock Turtle, and said <div class="bookquote">`What else had you to learn?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Well, there was Mystery,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle replied, counting off the subjects on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern, with Seaography: then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old conger-eel, that used to come once a week
<div class="bookquote">` Well, then,'  (<font color='red'><b>flappers</b></font>)</div>the Gryphon went on, <div class="bookquote">`if you don't know what to uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>: HE (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) taught us Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.' <div class="bookquote">`
What was THAT like?'  (<font color='red'><b>HE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Well, I can't show it you myself,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle said: <div class="bookquote">`I'm too stiff.
And the Gryphon never learnt it.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Hadn't time,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon: <div class="bookquote">`I went to the Classics master, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was an old crab, HE (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
I never went to him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle said with a sigh: <div class="bookquote">`he (<font color='blue'><b>Turtle</b></font>) taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
So he (<font color='blue'><b>Turtle</b></font>) did, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Turtle</b></font>) did,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon, sighing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Turtle</b></font>) turn; and both creatures hid their faces in their paws. <div class="bookquote">`
And how many hours a day did you do lessons?'  (<font color='red'><b>both creatures</b></font>)</div>said Alice, in a hurry to change the subject. <div class="bookquote">` Ten hours the first day,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle: <div class="bookquote">`nine the next, and so on.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` What a curious plan!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Alice. <div class="bookquote">` That's the reason they're called lessons,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Gryphon remarked: <div class="bookquote">`because they lessen from day to day.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought it over a little before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) next remark. <div class="bookquote">`
Then the eleventh day must have been a holiday?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Of course it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle. <div class="bookquote">` And how did you manage on the twelfth?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>Alice went on eagerly. <div class="bookquote">` That's enough about lessons,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Gryphon interrupted in a very decided tone: <div class="bookquote">` tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) something about the games now.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>CHAPTER X. The Lobster Quadrille The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) eyes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or two sobs choked his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) voice. <div class="bookquote">`
Same as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) had a bone in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) throat,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon: and it set to work shaking him (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) and punching him (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) in the back.
At last the Mock Turtle recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) voice, and, with tears running down his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) cheeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) went on again:-- <div class="bookquote">`You may not have lived much under the sea--'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>-LRB-'I haven't,' said Alice-RRB---`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--' -LRB-Alice began to say <div class="bookquote">`I once tasted--'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>but checked herself hastily, and said <div class="bookquote">`No, never' (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`
--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No, indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` What sort of a dance is it?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Why,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon, <div class="bookquote">`you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Two lines!'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>cried the Mock Turtle. <div class="bookquote">` Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on; then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`THAT generally takes some time,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>interrupted the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">` --you advance twice--'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Each with a lobster as a partner!'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>cried the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">`
Of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle said: <div class="bookquote">`advance twice, set to partners--'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`--change lobsters, and retire in same order,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div>continued the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">`
Then, you know,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle went on, <div class="bookquote">`you throw the--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`The lobsters!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air. <div class="bookquote">`
--as far out to sea as you can--'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Swim after them!'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>screamed the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">`Turn a somersault in the sea!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div>cried the Mock Turtle, capering wildly about. <div class="bookquote">`
Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) voice; and the two creatures, who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
Change lobsters again!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice. <div class="bookquote">` It must be a very pretty dance,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>said Alice timidly. <div class="bookquote">`
Would you like to see a little of it?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle. <div class="bookquote">` Very much indeed,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Come, let's try the first figure!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle to the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">`
We can do without lobsters, you know. Which shall sing?'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh, YOU sing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">` I've forgotten the words.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now and then treading on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) toes when they passed too close, and waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle sang this, very slowly and sadly:-- `
``Will you walk a little faster?'' said a whiting to a snail. '' There's a porpoise close behind us, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>)'s treading on my tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance! They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
You can really have no notion how delightful it will be When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to sea!''
'' But the snail replied ``Too far, too far!'' and gave a look askance-- Said he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) thanked the whiting kindly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) would not join the dance.
Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join the dance. Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join the dance. <div class="bookquote">`
'' What matters it how far we go? '' his (<font color='blue'><b>us</b></font>) scaly friend replied. '' There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France-- Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the dance? Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the dance?
'''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last: <div class="bookquote">`and
I do so like that curious song about the whiting!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Oh, as to the whiting,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle, <div class="bookquote">`they--you've seen them, of course?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">`I've often seen them at dinn--'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) checked herself hastily. <div class="bookquote">` I don't know where Dinn may be,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle, <div class="bookquote">`but

But they HAVE their tails in their mouths; and the reason is--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>here the Mock Turtle yawned and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) eyes.--`Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) about the reason and all that,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) said to the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">`
The reason is,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon, <div class="bookquote">`that they WOULD go with the lobsters to the dance. So they got thrown out to sea.
So they had to fall a long way. So they got their tails fast in their mouths. So they couldn't get them out again.
I never knew so much about a whiting before.'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I can tell you more than that, if you like,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">`
That's all.'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Thank you,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice, <div class="bookquote">`it's very interesting.

(<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I never thought about it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
Why?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>the Gryphon replied very solemnly. Alice was thoroughly puzzled. <div class="bookquote">` Does the boots and shoes!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) repeated in a wondering tone. <div class="bookquote">` Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">` I mean, what makes them so shiny?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) answer. <div class="bookquote">` They're done with blacking, I believe.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Boots and shoes under the sea,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>the Gryphon went on in a deep voice, <div class="bookquote">`are done with a whiting. Now you know.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` And what are they made of?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice asked in a tone of great curiosity. <div class="bookquote">` Soles and eels, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Gryphon replied rather impatiently: <div class="bookquote">`any shrimp could have told you that.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were still running on the song, <div class="bookquote">`I'd have said to the porpoise, ``Keep back, please: we don't want YOU with us!'''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`They were obliged to have him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) with them,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle said: <div class="bookquote">`no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock Turtle/Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Wouldn't it really?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice in a tone of great surprise. <div class="bookquote">`
Of course not,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle: `why, if a fish came to ME, and told me he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) was going a journey, I should say ``With what porpoise?

(<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` I mean what I say,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle replied in an offended tone.
And the Gryphon added <div class="bookquote">`Come, let's hear some of YOUR adventures.'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>said Alice a little timidly: <div class="bookquote">`
but it's no use going back to yesterday, because I was a different person then.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Explain all that,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle. <div class="bookquote">`
No, no! The adventures first,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon in an impatient tone: <div class="bookquote">`explanations take such a dreadful time.'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>So Alice began telling them her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) adventures from the time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) first saw the White Rabbit.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was a little nervous about it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), one on each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gained courage as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on.
YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said <div class="bookquote">`That's very curious.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) listeners were perfectly quiet till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got to the part about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) repeating ` <div class="bookquote">` It's all about as curious as it can be,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">`
It all came different!'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle repeated thoughtfully. <div class="bookquote">` I should like to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) try and repeat something now.
Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) to begin.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) looked at the Gryphon as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) thought it had some kind of authority over Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>thought Alice; <div class="bookquote">`I might as well be at school at once.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got up, and began to repeat it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head was so full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hardly knew what she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was saying, and the words came very queer indeed:-- ''
Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) declare, ``You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.
As a duck with its eyelids, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) nose Trims his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) belt and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) buttons, and turns out his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) toes.'

<div class="bookquote">` That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">` Well, I never heard it before,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle; <div class="bookquote">`but it sounds uncommon nonsense.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>Alice said nothing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had sat down with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way again. <div class="bookquote">`
I should like to have it explained,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the Mock Turtle. <div class="bookquote">` She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) can't explain it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon hastily. <div class="bookquote">`
Go on with the next verse.'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` But about his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) toes?'  (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle persisted. <div class="bookquote">` How COULD he (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) turn them out with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) nose, you know?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It's the first position in dancing.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice said; but was dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject. <div class="bookquote">`
'''  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice did not dare to disobey, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) felt sure it would all come wrong, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went on in a trembling voice:-- <div class="bookquote">`I passed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) garden, and marked, with one eye, How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>-LSB-later editions continued as follows
Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently: `it begins ``I passed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Mock</b></font>) garden. The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat, While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon, Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon: While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl, And concluded the banquet---RSB- <div class="bookquote">`
What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Owl</b></font>)</div>the Mock Turtle interrupted, <div class="bookquote">`if you don't explain it as you go on?
It's by far the most confusing thing I ever heard!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, I think you'd better leave off,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Gryphon: and
Alice was only too glad to do so. <div class="bookquote">` Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Gryphon went on. <div class="bookquote">`
Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather offended tone, <div class="bookquote">`Hm!
Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you a song?'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` No accounting for tastes! Sing her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ``Turtle Soup,'' will you, old fellow?'
 (<font color='red'><b>Mock</b></font>)</div>The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked with sobs, to sing this:-- `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green, Waiting in a hot tureen!
Who for such dainties would not stoop? Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup! ` Beautiful Soup! Who cares for fish, Game, or any other dish?
Who would not give all else for two Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup? Beau--ootiful Soo--oop! Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
<div class="bookquote">`Chorus again!'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had just begun to repeat it, when a cry of <div class="bookquote">`The trial's beginning!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Mock Turtle</b></font>)</div>was heard in the distance. <div class="bookquote">`Come on!'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand, it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song. `
Alice panted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran; but the Gryphon only answered <div class="bookquote">`Come on!'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>and ran the faster, while more and more faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them,
Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!' What trial is it?' the melancholy words:-- <div class="bookquote">`Soo--oop of the e--e--evening, Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'
 (<font color='red'><b>The King Queen</b></font>)</div>The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--
all sorts of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard him (<font color='blue'><b>soldier</b></font>); and near the King was the White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the other.
In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to look at them--'I wish they'd get the trial done,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, <div class="bookquote">`and hand round the refreshments!'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) began looking at everything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), to pass away the time.
Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had read about them in books, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was quite pleased to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knew the name of nearly everything there. `
The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) wore his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) crown over the wig, -LRB-look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) did it,-RRB- he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly not becoming. <div class="bookquote">`
CHAPTER XI. Who Stole the Tarts? That's the judge,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself, <div class="bookquote">`because of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) great wig.'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, <div class="bookquote">`and those twelve creatures,'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>-LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was obliged to say <div class="bookquote">`creatures,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>you see, because some of them were animals, and some were birds,-RRB- <div class="bookquote">` I suppose they are the jurors.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of it: for she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) age knew the meaning of it at all.
However, <div class="bookquote">`jury-men'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>would have done just as well. The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. <div class="bookquote">` What are they doing?'
 (<font color='red'><b>The jurors</b></font>)</div>They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in reply, <div class="bookquote">`for fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div>`
Alice whispered to the Gryphon. <div class="bookquote">` They can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'  (<font color='red'><b>Gryphon</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Stupid things!'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, <div class="bookquote">`Silence in the court!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>Alice could see, as well as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) were looking over their shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down <div class="bookquote">`stupid things!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the jurors</b></font>)</div>on their slates, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could even make out that one of them didn't know how to spell <div class="bookquote">`stupid,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and that he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) had to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) neighbour to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
and the King put on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who was talking. A nice muddle their slates'll be in before the trial's over!'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>thought Alice.
This of course, Alice could not stand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) went round the court and got behind him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>), and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) did it so quickly that the poor little juror -LRB-it was Bill, the Lizard-RRB- could not make out at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate. `
On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:-- <div class="bookquote">`The Queen of Hearts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) made some tarts, All on a summer day: The Knave of Hearts, he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) stole those tarts, And took them quite away!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked. Herald, read the accusation!' said the King. <div class="bookquote">`Consider your verdict,'  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>the King said to the jury. `
<div class="bookquote">`Call the first witness,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King Rabbit</b></font>)</div>said the King; and the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, <div class="bookquote">`First witness!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted. <div class="bookquote">` There's a great deal to come before that!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Rabbit</b></font>)</div>The first witness was the Hatter.
I beg pardon, your Majesty,' he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">`for bringing these in: but I hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. ` <div class="bookquote">` You ought to have finished,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said the King. <div class="bookquote">`
When did you begin?'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) into the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse. <div class="bookquote">`
Fourteenth of March, I think it was,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) said. <div class="bookquote">` Fifteenth,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the March Hare. <div class="bookquote">` Sixteenth,'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>added the Dormouse. <div class="bookquote">`
Write that down,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>the King said to the jury, and the jury eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence. <div class="bookquote">`
Take off your hat,'  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>the King said to the Hatter. <div class="bookquote">` It isn't mine,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter. <div class="bookquote">` Stolen!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a memorandum of the fact. <div class="bookquote">`
I keep them to sell,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>the Hatter added as an explanation; <div class="bookquote">`I've none of my own. I'm a hatter.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>Here the Queen put on her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spectacles, and began staring at the Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted. `
This did not seem to encourage the witness at all: he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) kept shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the Queen, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) confusion he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) bit a large piece out of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.
Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) a good deal until she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) made out what it was: she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was beginning to grow larger again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) decided to remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was as long as there was room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
Give your evidence,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said the King; <div class="bookquote">`and don't be nervous, or I'll have you executed on the spot.'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was sitting next to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
I can hardly breathe.'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I can't help it,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice very meekly: <div class="bookquote">`I'm growing.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` You've no right to grow here,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Dormouse. <div class="bookquote">`
Don't talk nonsense,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>said Alice more boldly: <div class="bookquote">`you know you're growing too.'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Dormouse: <div class="bookquote">`not in that ridiculous fashion.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hatter</b></font>) said to one of the officers of the court, <div class="bookquote">`Bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!'  (<font color='red'><b>the officers</b></font>)</div>on which the wretched Hatter trembled so, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dormouse</b></font>) shook both his (<font color='blue'><b>Dormouse</b></font>) shoes off. <div class="bookquote">`
And he (<font color='blue'><b>Dormouse</b></font>) got up very sulkily and crossed over to the other side of the court. Give your evidence,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the King repeated angrily, <div class="bookquote">`or I'll have you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
I'm a poor man, your Majesty,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>the Hatter began, in a trembling voice, <div class="bookquote">`--and The twinkling of the what?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the King. <div class="bookquote">`
It began with the tea,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>the Hatter replied. <div class="bookquote">` Of course twinkling begins with a T!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the King sharply. <div class="bookquote">`
Do you take me for a dunce? Go on!'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` I'm a poor man,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>the Hatter went on, <div class="bookquote">`and most things twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`I didn't!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry. <div class="bookquote">` You did!'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter. <div class="bookquote">` I deny it!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the March Hare. <div class="bookquote">`
Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--'  (<font color='red'><b>Hare</b></font>)</div>the Hatter went on, looking anxiously round to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) would deny it too: but the Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep. <div class="bookquote">`
He (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) denies it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Dormouse</b></font>)</div>said the King: <div class="bookquote">`leave out that part.'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` After that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>continued the Hatter, <div class="bookquote">`I cut some more bread-and-butter--'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
But what did the Dormouse say?'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>one of the jury asked. <div class="bookquote">` That I can't remember,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter. <div class="bookquote">` You MUST remember,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>remarked the King, <div class="bookquote">`or
I'll have you executed.'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>The miserable Hatter dropped his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) teacup and bread-and-butter, and went down on one knee. <div class="bookquote">` I'm a poor man, your Majesty,'  (<font color='red'><b>The Hatter</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) began. <div class="bookquote">`
You're a very poor speaker,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the King. Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court.
They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat upon it.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`
-LRB-As that is rather a hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done. I'm glad I've seen that done,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>thought Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
I've so often read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, ``There was some attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court,'' and I never understood what it meant till now.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>continued the King. <div class="bookquote">` I can't go no lower,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter: <div class="bookquote">`I'm on the floor, as it is.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Then you may SIT down,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Hatter</b></font>)</div>the King replied. Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed. <div class="bookquote">` Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>thought Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
I'd rather finish my tea,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the Hatter, with an anxious look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers. <div class="bookquote">`
You may go,'  (<font color='red'><b>singers</b></font>)</div>said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the court, without even waiting to put his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) shoes on.
--and just take his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head off outside,' the Queen added to one of the officers: but the Hatter was out of sight before the officer could get to the door. <div class="bookquote">`
Now we shall get on better.'  (<font color='red'><b>the officer</b></font>)</div>` <div class="bookquote">` Call the next witness!'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said the King. The next witness was the Duchess's cook.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) carried the pepper-box in her (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) got into the court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once. `
The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">`Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'  (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Well, if I must, I must,'  (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>the King said, with a melancholy air, and, after folding his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) arms and frowning at the cook till his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) eyes were nearly out of sight, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said in a deep voice, <div class="bookquote">`What are tarts made of?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
Give your evidence,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the King. <div class="bookquote">` Shan't,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said the cook. Pepper, mostly,' said the cook. <div class="bookquote">` Treacle,'  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>said a sleepy voice behind her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">`
Collar that Dormouse,'  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>the Queen shrieked out. ` Behead that Dormouse! Turn that Dormouse out of court! Suppress him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)! Pinch him (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)!
For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had disappeared. <div class="bookquote">`
Off with his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) whiskers!'  (<font color='red'><b>the cook</b></font>)</div>Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief. <div class="bookquote">` Call the next witness.'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) added in an undertone to the Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
Alice watched the White Rabbit as he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) fumbled over the list, feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like, <div class="bookquote">`--for they haven't got much evidence
It quite makes my forehead ache!'  (<font color='red'><b>the witness</b></font>)</div>YET ,' she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself. Imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top of his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) shrill little voice, the name <div class="bookquote">`Alice!'
 (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had grown in the last few minutes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) jumped up in such a hurry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) tipped over the jury-box with the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) very much of a globe of goldfish she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had accidentally upset the week before. `
she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) exclaimed in a tone of great dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could, for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jury-box, or they would die. <div class="bookquote">`
The trial cannot proceed,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said the King in a very grave voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--
CHAPTER XII. Alice's Evidence <div class="bookquote">`Here!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Oh, I BEG your pardon!' ALL,' he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said do.
Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) haste, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable to move.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) soon got it out again, and put it right; <div class="bookquote">`not that it signifies much,'  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) said to herself; <div class="bookquote">`I should think it would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the court. <div class="bookquote">`
What do you know about this business?'  (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>the King said to Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Nothing WHATEVER?'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>persisted the King. `
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted: <div class="bookquote">`UNimportant, your Majesty means, of course,'  (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) spoke. <div class="bookquote">`
UNimportant, of course, I meant,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the King hastily said, and went on to himself in an undertone, <div class="bookquote">`important--unimportant--unimportant--important--'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>as if he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) were trying which word sounded best.
Nothing whatever,' said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` That's very important,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the King said, turning to the jury. Some of the jury wrote it down <div class="bookquote">`important,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>and some <div class="bookquote">`unimportant.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>Alice could see this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) was near enough to look over their slates; <div class="bookquote">`but it doesn't matter a bit,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) thought to herself.
At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily writing in his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) note-book, cackled out <div class="bookquote">`Silence!'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>and read out from his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) book, <div class="bookquote">`Rule Forty-two.
ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'  (<font color='red'><b>Everybody</b></font>)</div>Everybody looked at Alice. <div class="bookquote">` I'M not a mile high,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
You are,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the King. <div class="bookquote">` Nearly two miles high ,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>added the Queen. <div class="bookquote">` Well, I shan't go, at any rate,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said Alice: <div class="bookquote">`besides, that's not a regular rule: you invented it just now.'
 (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` It's the oldest rule in the book,'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the King. <div class="bookquote">` Then it ought to be Number One,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said Alice.
The King turned pale, and shut his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) note-book hastily. <div class="bookquote">`Consider your verdict,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice. <div class="bookquote">`
There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; <div class="bookquote">`this paper has just been picked up.'  (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
I haven't opened it yet,'  (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>said the White Rabbit, <div class="bookquote">`but it seems to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>What's in it?' said the Queen. ` <div class="bookquote">` It must have been that,'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the King, <div class="bookquote">`unless it was written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Who is it directed to?'  (<font color='red'><b>the jurymen</b></font>)</div>said one of the jurymen. <div class="bookquote">` It isn't directed at all,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jurymen</b></font>)</div>said the White Rabbit; <div class="bookquote">`in fact, there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) unfolded the paper as he (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) spoke, and added <div class="bookquote">`It isn't a letter, after all: it's a set of verses.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?'  (<font color='red'><b>the jurymen</b></font>)</div>asked another of the jurymen. <div class="bookquote">`
No, they're not,'  (<font color='red'><b>the jurymen</b></font>)</div>said the White Rabbit, <div class="bookquote">`and that's the queerest thing about it.'  (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit thing</b></font>)</div>-LRB-The jury all looked puzzled.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) must have imitated somebody else's hand,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said the King.
-LRB-The jury all brightened up again.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">`Please your Majesty,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said the Knave, <div class="bookquote">`I didn't write it, and they can't prove I did
: there's no name signed at the end.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`If you didn't sign it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said the King, `that only makes the matter worse.
There was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really clever thing the King had said that day. <div class="bookquote">`
You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd have signed your name like an honest man.'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>That PROVES his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) guilt,' said the Queen. <div class="bookquote">`
It proves nothing of the sort!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Why, you don't even know what they're about!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Read them,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said the King.
The White Rabbit put on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) spectacles. <div class="bookquote">` Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?'  (<font color='red'><b>The White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Majesty</b></font>) asked. <div class="bookquote">` Begin at the beginning,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>the King said gravely, <div class="bookquote">`and go on till you come to the end: then stop.'
 (<font color='red'><b>King</b></font>)</div>These were the verses the White Rabbit read:-- <div class="bookquote">` They told me you had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), And mentioned me to him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>):
She (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave me a good character, But said I could not swim. He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) sent them word I had not gone -LRB-We know it to be true-RRB-: If she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should push the matter on, What would become of you?
I gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) one, they gave him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) two, You gave us three or more; They all returned from him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) to you, Though they were mine before.
If I or she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) should chance to be Involved in this affair, He (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) trusts to you to set them free, Exactly as we were.
My notion was that you had been -LRB-Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had this fit-RRB- An obstacle that came between Him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>), and ourselves, and it.
Don't let him (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) know she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) liked them best, For this must ever be A secret, kept from all the rest, Between yourself and me.'
 (<font color='red'><b>the White Rabbit</b></font>)</div>That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,' said the King, rubbing his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) hands; <div class="bookquote">`so now let the jury--'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`If any one of them can explain it,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>said Alice, -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had grown so large in the last few minutes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wasn't a bit afraid of interrupting him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>),-RRB- `
The jury all wrote down on their slates, <div class="bookquote">`SHE doesn't believe there's an atom of meaning in it,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>but none of them attempted to explain the paper. <div class="bookquote">`
If there's no meaning in it,'  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said the King, <div class="bookquote">`that saves a world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.
And yet I don't know,'  (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) went on, spreading out the verses on his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) knee, and looking at them with one eye; `
<div class="bookquote">` I'll give him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) sixpence. I don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I seem to see some meaning in them, after all.
'' --SAID I COULD NOT SWIM-- '' you can't swim, can you?' he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) added, turning to the Knave. The Knave shook his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) head sadly. <div class="bookquote">`
Do I look like it?'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) said. -LRB-Which he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.-RRB- <div class="bookquote">` All right, so far,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said the King, and he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) went on muttering over the verses to himself: <div class="bookquote">`
``WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE-- '' that's the jury, of course--``I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO-- '' why, that must be what he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) did with the tarts, you know--'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`
But, it goes on ``THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,'''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">` Why, there they are!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said the King triumphantly, pointing to the tarts on the table. <div class="bookquote">`
Nothing can be clearer than THAT. Then again--``BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT-- '' you never had fits, my dear, I think?'
 (<font color='red'><b>the King</b></font>)</div>-LRB-The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) slate with one finger, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) found it made no mark; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) face, as long as it lasted.-RRB- `
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bill</b></font>) said to the Queen. <div class="bookquote">` Never!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) spoke. Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round the court with a smile.
the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed, <div class="bookquote">`Let the jury consider their verdict,'  (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>the King said, for about the twentieth time that day. `
There was a dead silence. <div class="bookquote">` It's a pun!'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No, no!' said the Queen. <div class="bookquote">` Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">` Stuff and nonsense!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>said Alice loudly. <div class="bookquote">`
The idea of having the sentence first!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">`Hold your tongue!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said the Queen, turning purple. <div class="bookquote">` I won't!'  (<font color='red'><b>the Queen</b></font>)</div>said Alice. <div class="bookquote">`
Off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head!'  (<font color='red'><b>Alice/ALICE</b></font>)</div>the Queen shouted at the top of her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) voice. Nobody moved. <div class="bookquote">` Who cares for you?'  (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div>said Alice, -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had grown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) full size by this time.-RRB- `
At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) gave a little scream, half of fright and half of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on the bank, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head in the lap of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister, who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) face. <div class="bookquote">`
You're nothing but a pack of cards!'  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Wake up, Alice dear!' said her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister; <div class="bookquote">`Why, what a long sleep you've had!'
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could remember them, all these strange Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) had finished, her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), and said, <div class="bookquote">`It WAS a curious dream, dear, certainly: but now run in to your tea; it's getting late.'
 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) ran, as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) might, what a wonderful dream it had been.
But her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) sister sat still just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>), leaning her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head on her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of little Alice and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) wonderful Adventures, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) too began dreaming after a fashion, and this was her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dream:--
First, she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hers--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could hear the very tones of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) voice, and see that queer little toss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) head to keep back the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) eyes--and still as she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place around her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) became alive with the strange creatures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) little sister's dream.
The long grass rustled at her (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) feet as the White Rabbit hurried by--the frightened Mouse splashed his (<font color='blue'><b>White</b></font>) way through the neighbouring pool--she (<font color='blue'><b>Alice</b></font>) could hear the rattle of the teacups as the March Hare and his (<font color='blue'><b>Hare</b></font>) friends shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs, filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable Mock Turtle.
So she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in Wonderland, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Duchess</b></font>) had but to open them again, and all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change -LRB-she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) knew-RRB- to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's heavy sobs.
Lastly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Queen</b></font>) pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would keep, through all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) riper years, the simple and loving heart of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) childhood: and how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would gather about her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of Wonderland of long ago: and how she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would feel with all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys, remembering her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own child-life, and the happy summer days.
