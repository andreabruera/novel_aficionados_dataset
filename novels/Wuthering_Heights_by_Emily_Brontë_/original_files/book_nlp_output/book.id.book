I can hardly regard her in the light of a rational creature , so obstinately has she persisted in forming a fabulous notion of my character and acting on the false impressions she cherished . I do n't perceive the silly smiles and grimaces that provoked me at first ; and the senseless incapability of discerning that I was in earnest when I gave her my opinion of her infatuation and herself . But , at last , I think she begins to know me : It was a marvellous effort of perspicacity to discover that I did not love her . And yet it is poorly learnt ; for this morning she announced , as a piece of appalling intelligence , that I had actually succeeded in making her hate me ! I believed , at one time , no lessons could teach her that ! A positive labour of Hercules , I assure you ! If it be achieved , I have cause to return thanks . Can I trust your assertion , Isabella ? Are you sure you hate me ? If I let you alone for half a day , wo n't you come sighing and wheedling to me again ? I daresay she would rather I had seemed all tenderness before you : it wounds her vanity to have the truth exposed . But I do n't care who knows that the passion was wholly on one side : and I never told her a lie about it . The first thing she saw me do , on coming out of the Grange , was to hang up her little dog ; and when she pleaded for it , the first words I uttered were a wish that I had the hanging of every being belonging to her , except one : possibly she took that exception for herself . But no brutality disgusted her : I suppose she has an innate admiration of it , if only her precious person were secure from injury ! Now , was it not the depth of absurdity -- of genuine idiotcy , for that pitiful , slavish , mean-minded brach to dream that I could love her ? She can not accuse me of showing one bit of deceitful softness . Tell your master , Nelly , that I never , in all my life , met with such an abject thing as she is . She even disgraces the name of Linton ; and I 've sometimes relented , from pure lack of invention , in my experiments on what she could endure , and still creep shamefully cringing back ! But tell him , also , to set his fraternal and magisterial heart at ease : that I keep strictly within the limits of the law . I have avoided , up to this period , giving her the slightest right to claim a separation ; and , what 's more , she 'd thank nobody for dividing us .

He has been blaming our father -LRB- how dared he ? -RRB- for treating H. too liberally ; and swears he will reduce him to his right place -- ' ","i":8016},{"w":"` Then , ' ","i":13064},{"w":"` Nay , Cathy , ' ","i":16694},{"w":"` Well , do n't cry , ' ","i":23684},{"w":"` you 're not killed . Do n't make more mischief ; my brother is coming : be quiet ! Hush , Isabella ! Has anybody hurt you ?

And now I 'll cry -- I 'll cry myself sick ! ' ","i":29360},{"w":"` Oh , dear ! ' ","i":31425},{"w":"` I 'm very unhappy ! ' ","i":31436},{"w":"` Perfectly right ; if people be right to marry only for the present . And now , let us hear what you are unhappy about . Your brother will be pleased ; the old lady and gentleman will not object , I think ; you will escape from a disorderly , comfortless home into a wealthy , respectable one ; and you love Edgar , and Edgar loves you . Here ! and here ! ' ","i":32332},{"w":"` in whichever place the soul lives . All seems smooth and easy : where is the obstacle ? ' ","i":32426},{"w":"` Yes , now and then , ' ","i":32559},{"w":"` All sinners would be miserable in heaven . ' ","i":32875},{"w":"` I 'm not sure whether he were not at the door this moment .

' ","i":39375},{"w":"` Well , well , ' ","i":39399},{"w":"` I know you did n't like him , ' ","i":39438},{"w":"` Yet , for my sake , you must be friends now . Shall I tell him to come up ?

How can you say I am harsh , you naughty fondling ? ' ","i":42380},{"w":"` It was no hint that your company was superfluous ? We did n't care whether you kept with us or not ; I merely thought Heathcliff 's talk would have nothing entertaining for your ears .

I 'd as soon put that little canary into the park on a winter 's day , as recommend you to bestow your heart on him ! Tell her what Heathcliff is : an unreclaimed creature , without refinement , without cultivation ; an arid wilderness of furze and whinstone . It is deplorable ignorance of his character , child , and nothing else , which makes that dream enter your head . Pray , do n't imagine that he conceals depths of benevolence and affection beneath a stern exterior ! He 's not a rough diamond -- a pearl-containing oyster of a rustic : he 's a fierce , pitiless , wolfish man . I never say to him , `` Let this or that enemy alone , because it would be ungenerous or cruel to harm them ; '' I say , `` Let them alone , because I should hate them to be wronged : '' and he 'd crush you like a sparrow 's egg , Isabella , if he found you a troublesome charge . I know he could n't love a Linton ; and yet he 'd be quite capable of marrying your fortune and expectations that had he thought seriously to catch you , I should , perhaps , have held my tongue , and let you fall into his trap .

' ","i":46963},{"w":"` Oh , the evil is that I am not jealous , is it ? ' ","i":47452},{"w":"` Well , I wo n't repeat my offer of a wife : it is as bad as offering Satan a lost soul . Your bliss lies , like his , in inflicting misery . Edgar is restored from the ill-temper he gave way to at your coming ; I begin to be secure and tranquil ; and you , restless to know us at peace , appear resolved on exciting a quarrel . Quarrel with Edgar , if you please , Heathcliff , and deceive his sister : you 'll hit on exactly the most efficient method of revenging yourself on me . ' ","i":47471},{"w":"` Ellen , ' ","i":47650},{"w":"` Get away , now ; he 'll return with a brace of pistols and half-a-dozen assistants . If he did overhear us , of course he 'd never forgive you . You 've played me an ill turn , Heathcliff ! But go -- make haste ! I 'd rather see Edgar at bay than you . ' ","i":48823},{"w":"` I demand it ! Do n't you see I can scarcely stand ? Edgar , you -- you leave me ! ' ","i":49901},{"w":"` That 's a turkey 's , ' ","i":51553},{"w":"` and this is a wild duck 's ; and this is a pigeon 's . Ah , they put pigeons ' ","i":51566},{"w":"` It was Monday evening , ' ","i":52585},{"w":"` Only that brief time ? ' ","i":52623},{"w":"` it must be more . As soon as ever I had barred the door , utter blackness overwhelmed me , and I fell on the floor . I could n't explain to Edgar how certain I felt of having a fit , or going raging mad , if he persisted in teasing me ! I had no command of tongue , or brain , and he did not guess my agony , perhaps : it barely left me sense to try to escape from him and his voice . Before I recovered sufficiently to see and hear , it began to be dawn , and , Nelly , I 'll tell you what I thought , and what has kept recurring and recurring till I feared for my reason . I thought as I lay there , with my head against that table leg , and my eyes dimly discerning the grey square of the window , that I was enclosed in the oak-panelled bed at home ; and my heart ached with some great grief which , just waking , I could not recollect . I pondered , and worried myself to discover what it could be , and , most strangely , the whole last seven years of my life grew a blank ! I was a child ; my father was just buried , and my misery arose from the separation that Hindley had ordered between me and Heathcliff . I was laid alone , for the first time ; and , rousing from a dismal doze after a night of weeping , I lifted my hand to push the panels aside : it struck the table-top ! I swept it along the carpet , and then memory burst in : my late anguish was swallowed in a paroxysm of despair . I did not recall that they had been at all . I can not say why I felt so wildly wretched : it must have been temporary derangement ; for there is scarcely cause . But , supposing at twelve years old I had been wrenched from the Heights , and every early association , and my all in all , as Heathcliff was at that time , and been converted at a stroke into Mrs. Linton , the lady of Thrushcross Grange , and the wife of a stranger : an exile , and outcast , thenceforth , from what had been my world . You may fancy a glimpse of the abyss where I grovelled ! Shake your head as you will , Nelly , you have helped to unsettle me ! You should have spoken to Edgar , indeed you should , and compelled him to leave me quiet ! Oh , I 'm burning ! I wish I were out of doors ! I wish I were a girl again , half savage and hardy , and free ; and laughing at injuries , not maddening under them ! Why am I so changed ? why does my blood rush into a hell of tumult at a few words ? I 'm sure I should be myself were I once among the heather on those hills . Open the window again wide : fasten it open ! Quick , why do n't you move ? ' ","i":52687},{"w":"` Ah ! Nelly has played traitor , ' ","i":54614},{"w":"` Nelly is my hidden enemy . You witch ! So you do seek elf-bolts to hurt us ! Let me go , and I 'll make her rue ! I 'll make her howl a recantation ! ' ","i":54628},{"w":"` These are the earliest flowers at the Heights , ' ","i":56832},{"w":"` They remind me of soft thaw winds , and warm sunshine , and nearly melted snow . The snow is quite gone down here , darling , ' ","i":56846},{"w":"` He did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit . This is Edgar 's legal nephew , ' ","i":58128},{"w":"` No ! ' ","i":59659},{"w":"` should he offer to leave me , he 's a dead man : persuade him to attempt it , and you are a murderess ! I will have it back ; and I 'll have his gold too ; and then his blood ; and hell shall have his soul ! Am I to lose all , without a chance of retrieval ? Is Hareton to be a beggar ? Oh , damnation ! It will be ten times blacker with that guest than ever it was before ! ' ","i":59666},{"w":"` You and Edgar have broken my heart , Heathcliff ! And you both come to bewail the deed to me , as if you were the people to be pitied ! I shall not pity you , not I . You have killed me -- and thriven on it , I think . How strong you are ! How many years do you mean to live after I am gone ? ' ","i":67432},{"w":"` I shall not be at peace , ' ","i":67924},{"w":"` Let me alone . Let me alone , ' ","i":68857},{"w":"` If I 've done wrong , I 'm dying for it . It is enough ! You left me too : but I wo n't upbraid you ! I forgive you . Forgive me ! ' ","i":68870},{"w":"` I wrung my hands , and cried out ; and Mr. Linton hastened his step at the noise . She 's fainted , or dead , ' ","i":69548},{"w":"` I shall not refuse to go out of doors , ' ","i":69762},{"w":"` I 'll smash it ! ' ","i":72825},{"w":"` and then I 'll burn it ! ' ","i":72841},{"w":"` There ! he shall buy another , if he gets me back again . He 'd be capable of coming to seek me , to tease Edgar . I dare not stay , lest that notion should possess his wicked head ! And besides , Edgar has not been kind , has he ? Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here ; though , if I had not learned he was out of the way , I 'd have halted at the kitchen , washed my face , warmed myself , got you to bring what I wanted , and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed -- of that incarnate goblin ! And I wo n't come suing for his assistance ; nor will I bring him into more trouble . Ah , he was in such a fury ! Earnshaw is not his match in strength : I would n't have run till I 'd seen him all but demolished , had Hindley been able to do it ! ' ","i":72862},{"w":"` He 's not a human being , ' ","i":73537},{"w":"` and he has no claim on my charity . I gave him my heart , and he took and pinched it to death , and flung it back to me . People feel with their hearts , Ellen : and since he has destroyed mine , I have not power to feel for him : and I would not , though he groaned from this to his dying day , and wept tears of blood for Catherine ! No , indeed , indeed , I would n't ! ' ","i":73549},{"w":"` I recovered spirits sufficient to bear Joseph 's eternal lectures without weeping , and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly . I 'd rather sit with Hindley , and hear his awful talk , than with `` t ' ","i":74046},{"w":"` Damned -- thou saucy witch ! ' ","i":83311},{"w":"` Yes , yes , papa , ' ","i":85486},{"w":"` but I do want to see him ; and he has n't once looked out . ' ","i":85497},{"w":"` You 'll get home earlier for the ease ; and you shall receive a kind welcome . ' ","i":91224},{"w":"` I 'm tired of running , and the ground is dewy : I ca n't sit here . Let us go , Ellen . Besides , he says I have seen his son . He 's mistaken , I think ; but I guess where he lives : at the farmhouse I visited in coming from Penistone Crags . Do n't you ? ' ","i":91251},{"w":"` Naughty Ellen ! ' ","i":92294},{"w":"` Why did you quarrel ? ' ","i":92519},{"w":"` That 's wrong ! ' ","i":92533},{"w":"` I 've tied his tongue , ' ","i":93257},{"w":"` Ca n't read it ? ' ","i":93847},{"w":"` I can read it : it 's English . But I want to know why it is there . ' ","i":93857},{"w":"` Where is the use of the devil in that sentence ? ' ","i":94118},{"w":"` : I thought the burden of directing and warning would be more efficiently borne by him than me . Papa ! ' ","i":94580},{"w":"` guess whom I saw yesterday , in my walk on the moors . I saw -- but listen , and you shall hear how I found you out ; and Ellen , who is in league with you , and yet pretended to pity me so , when I kept hoping , and was always disappointed about Linton 's coming back ! ' ","i":94612},{"w":"` and he did n't object to our seeing each other : he said I might come to his house when I pleased ; only I must not tell you , because you had quarrelled with him , and would not forgive him for marrying aunt Isabella . You are the one to be blamed : he is willing to let us be friends , at least ; Linton and I ; and you are not . ' ","i":94930},{"w":"` I 'm going with it to the library ; and we 'll see what your father says to such loving . ' ","i":97099},{"w":"` Nor anything at all , then , my lady ? ' ","i":97138},{"w":"` Oh , it will be something worse , ' ","i":98340},{"w":"` And what shall I do when papa and you leave me , and I am by myself ? I ca n't forget your words , Ellen ; they are always in my ear . How life will be changed , how dreary the world will be , when papa and you are dead .

He makes them a little more attentive at least , ' ","i":101074},{"w":"` Yours is a wicked man , ' ","i":101700},{"w":"` and you are very naughty to dare to repeat what he says . He must be wicked to have made Aunt Isabella leave him as she did . ' ","i":101711},{"w":"` Oh ! ' ","i":101796},{"w":"` And she loved mine , ' ","i":101808},{"w":"` How do you feel now , Master Heathcliff ? ' ","i":102041},{"w":"` Must I go ? ' ","i":102397},{"w":"` unless you alter it for the worse by teasing me into a fever . ' ","i":102430},{"w":"` Do you want me to go , Linton ? ' ","i":102446},{"w":"` That 's too high , ' ","i":102807},{"w":"` she asked despairingly . No , that wo n't do , ' ","i":102852},{"w":"` No , ' ","i":103247},{"w":"` You wo n't go to-morrow , recollect , Miss ! ' ","i":103284},{"w":"` Oh , I 'll take good care , ' ","i":103322},{"w":"` The Grange is not a prison , Ellen , and you are not my gaoler . And besides , I 'm almost seventeen : I 'm a woman . And I 'm certain Linton would recover quickly if he had me to look after him . I 'm older than he is , you know , and wiser : less childish , am I not ? And he 'll soon do as I direct him , with some slight coaxing . He 's a pretty little darling when he 's good . I 'd make such a pet of him , if he were mine . We should never quarrel , should we after we were used to each other ? Do n't you like him , Ellen ? ' ","i":103366},{"w":"` Ellen , are not you tired ? Had n't you better lie down now ? You 'll be sick , keeping up so long , Ellen .

We have done nothing to deserve this separation ; and you are not angry with me : you have no reason to dislike me , you allow , yourself . I believe an interview would convince you that my father 's character is not mine : he affirms I am more your nephew than his son ; and though I have faults which render me unworthy of Catherine , she has excused them , and for her sake , you should also . You inquire after my health -- it is better ; but while I remain cut off from all hope , and doomed to solitude , or the society of those who never did and never will like me , how can I be cheerful and well ?

But I 'm hardly going to come to give Mr. Heathcliff pleasure ; whatever reason he may have for ordering Linton to undergo this penance . And , though I 'm glad he 's better in health , I 'm sorry he 's so much less pleasant , and so much less affectionate to me . ' ","i":111977},{"w":"` unless in dreams . I can not conceive how you manage to doze out of doors , in the morning . ' ","i":112194},{"w":"` Good-bye . Quick , Ellen ! ' ","i":112469},{"w":"` Why wo n't you be candid ?

I have not had a glimpse of one for weeks . I brought the last here -- and you gathered them , as a magpie gathers silver spoons , for the mere love of stealing ! They are of no use to you ; or else you concealed them in the bad spirit that , as you can not enjoy them , nobody else shall .

I expected such a transformation on raising the lid -- but I 'm better pleased that it should not commence till I share it . Besides , unless I had received a distinct impression of her passionless features , that strange feeling would hardly have been removed . It began oddly . You know I was wild after she died ; and eternally , from dawn to dawn , praying her to return to me her spirit ! I have a strong faith in ghosts : I have a conviction that they can , and do , exist among us ! The day she was buried , there came a fall of snow . I did n't fear that her fool of a husband would wander up the glen so late ; and no one else had business to bring them there . Being alone , and conscious two yards of loose earth was the sole barrier between us , I said to myself -- `` I 'll have her in my arms again ! If she be cold , I 'll think it is this north wind that chills me ; and if she be motionless , it is sleep . In the evening I went to the churchyard . It blew bleak as winter -- all round was solitary . '' I got a spade from the tool-house , and began to delve with all my might -- it scraped the coffin ; I fell to work with my hands ; the wood commenced cracking about the screws ; I was on the point of attaining my object , when it seemed that I heard a sigh from some one above , close at the edge of the grave , and bending down . '' If I can only get this off , '' I muttered , `` I wish they may shovel in the earth over us both ! '' and I wrenched at it more desperately still . There was another sigh , close at my ear . I appeared to feel the warm breath of it displacing the sleet-laden wind . I knew no living thing in flesh and blood was by ; but , as certainly as you perceive the approach to some substantial body in the dark , though it can not be discerned , so certainly I felt that Cathy was there : not under me , but on the earth . A sudden sense of relief flowed from my heart through every limb . I relinquished my labour of agony , and turned consoled at once : unspeakably consoled . Her presence was with me : it remained while I re-filled the grave , and led me home . You may laugh , if you will ; but I was sure I should see her there . I was sure she was with me , and I could not help talking to her . Having reached the Heights , I rushed eagerly to the door . It was fastened ; and , I remember , that accursed Earnshaw and my wife opposed my entrance . I remember stopping to kick the breath out of him , and then hurrying up-stairs , to my room and hers . I ought to have sweat blood then , from the anguish of my yearning -- from the fervour of my supplications to have but one glimpse ! I looked round impatiently -- I felt her by me -- I could almost see her , and yet I could not ! I had not one . She showed herself , as she often was in life , a devil to me ! And , since then , sometimes more and sometimes less , I 've been the sport of that intolerable torture ! Infernal ! keeping my nerves at such a stretch that , if they had not resembled catgut , they would long ago have relaxed to the feebleness of Linton 's . When I sat in the house with Hareton , it seemed that on going out I should meet her ; when I walked on the moors I should meet her coming in . When I went from home I hastened to return ; she must be somewhere at the Heights , I was certain ! And when I slept in her chamber -- I was beaten out of that . I could n't lie there ; for the moment I closed my eyes , she was either outside the window , or sliding back the panels , or entering the room , or even resting her darling head on the same pillow as she did when a child ; and I must open my lids to see . I 've often groaned aloud , till that old rascal Joseph no doubt believed that my conscience was playing the fiend inside of me . And so I opened and closed them a hundred times a night -- to be always disappointed ! It racked me ! Now , since I 've seen her , I 'm pacified -- a little . It was a strange way of killing : not by inches , but by fractions of hairbreadths , to beguile me with the spectre of a hope through eighteen years !

There were some persons sitting at cards ; Heathcliff joined them ; my brother lost some money to him , and , finding him plentifully supplied , he requested that he would come again in the evening : to which he consented . Hindley is too reckless to select his acquaintance prudently : he does n't trouble himself to reflect on the causes he might have for mistrusting one whom he has basely injured . But Heathcliff affirms his principal reason for resuming a connection with his ancient persecutor is a wish to install himself in quarters at walking distance from the Grange , and an attachment to the house where we lived together ; and likewise a hope that I shall have more opportunities of seeing him there than I could have if he settled in Gimmerton . He means to offer liberal payment for permission to lodge at the Heights ; and doubtless my brother 's covetousness will prompt him to accept the terms : he was always greedy ; though what he grasps with one hand he flings away with the other .

And if you flatter yourself that I do n't perceive it , you are a fool ; and if you think I can be consoled by sweet words , you are an idiot : and if you fancy I 'll suffer unrevenged , I 'll convince you of the contrary , in a very little while ! I want you to be aware that I know you have treated me infernally -- infernally ! Do you hear ? Meantime , thank you for telling me your sister-in-law 's secret : I swear I 'll make the most of it .

And take a good look at that countenance : she 's near the point which would suit me . No ; you 're not fit to be your own guardian , Isabella , now ; and I , being your legal protector , must retain you in my custody , however distasteful the obligation may be .

You say she never mentions my name , and that I am never mentioned to her . To whom should she mention me if I am a forbidden topic in the house ? She thinks you are all spies for her husband . Oh , I 've no doubt she 's in hell among you ! I guess by her silence , as much as anything , what she feels . You say she is often restless , and anxious-looking : is that a proof of tranquillity ? You talk of her mind being unsettled . How the devil could it be otherwise in her frightful isolation ? And that insipid , paltry creature attending her from duty and humanity ! He might as well plant an oak in a flower-pot , and expect it to thrive , as imagine he can restore her to vigour in the soil of his shallow cares ? Let us settle it at once : will you stay here , and am I to fight my way to Catherine over Linton and his footman ? From pity and charity ! Or will you be my friend , as you have been hitherto , and do what I request ? Well , Mr. Lockwood , I argued and complained , and flatly refused him fifty times ; but in the long run he forced me to an agreement . I engaged to carry a letter from him to my mistress ; and should she consent , I promised to let him have intelligence of Linton 's next absence from home , when he might come , and get in as he was able Decide ! because there is no reason for my lingering another minute , if you persist in your stubborn ill-nature !

What right -- answer me -- for the poor fancy you felt for Linton ? Because misery and degradation , and death , and nothing that God or Satan could inflict would have parted us , you , of your own will , did it . I have not broken your heart -- you have broken it ; and in breaking it , you have broken mine . So much the worse for me that I am strong . Do I want to live ?

You especially , the elder ; and less sensitive , as it turns out . I 've got your letters , and if you give me any pertness I 'll send them to your father . I presume you grew weary of the amusement and dropped it , did n't you ? Well , you dropped Linton with it into a Slough of Despond . He was in earnest : in love , really . As true as I live , he 's dying for you ; breaking his heart at your fickleness : not figuratively , but actually . Though Hareton has made him a standing jest for six weeks , and I have used more serious measures , and attempted to frighten him out of his idiotcy , he gets worse daily ; and he 'll be under the sod before summer , unless you restore him !

He cursed you , I dare say , for coming into the world -LRB- I did , at least -RRB- ; and it would just do if he cursed you as he went out of it . As far as I can see , it will be your chief diversion hereafter ; unless Linton make amends for other losses : and your provident parent appears to fancy he may . I 'd join him . I do n't love you ! How should I ? Weep away . His letters of advice and consolation entertained me vastly . In his last he recommended my jewel to be careful of his ; and kind to her when he got her . Careful and kind -- that 's paternal . But Linton requires his whole stock of care and kindness for himself . Linton can play the little tyrant well . He 'll undertake to torture any number of cats , if their teeth be drawn and their claws pared .

I brought him down one evening , the day before yesterday , and just set him in a chair , and never touched him afterwards . Stop !

He 's as bitter as gall at your desertion and its consequences : do n't expect thanks for this noble devotion .

We ran from the top of the Heights to the park , without stopping -- Catherine completely beaten in the race , because she was barefoot .

The light came from thence ; they had not put up the shutters , and the curtains were only half closed . Both of us were able to look in by standing on the basement , and clinging to the ledge , and we saw -- ah ! it was beautiful -- a splendid place carpeted with crimson , and crimson-covered chairs and tables , and a pure white ceiling bordered by gold , a shower of glass-drops hanging in silver chains from the centre , and shimmering with little soft tapers . Old Mr. and Mrs. Linton were not there ; Edgar and his sisters had it entirely to themselves . Should n't they have been happy ? We should have thought ourselves in heaven ! And now , guess what your good children were doing ? Isabella -- I believe she is eleven , a year younger than Cathy -- lay screaming at the farther end of the room , shrieking as if witches were running red-hot needles into her . Edgar stood on the hearth weeping silently , and in the middle of the table sat a little dog , shaking its paw and yelping ; which , from their mutual accusations , we understood they had nearly pulled in two between them . to quarrel who should hold a heap of warm hair , and each begin to cry because both , after struggling to get it , refused to take it . When would you catch me wishing to have what Catherine wanted ? or find us by ourselves , seeking entertainment in yelling , and sobbing , and rolling on the ground , divided by the whole room ?

Why should I ? And yet I can not continue in this condition ! I have to remind myself to breathe -- almost to remind my heart to beat ! And it is like bending back a stiff spring : it is by compulsion that I do the slightest act not prompted by one thought ; and by compulsion that I notice anything alive or dead , which is not associated with one universal idea . They have yearned towards it so long , and so unwaveringly , that I 'm convinced it will be reached -- and soon -- because it has devoured my existence : I am swallowed up in the anticipation of its fulfilment . I have a single wish , and my whole being and faculties are yearning to attain it . My confessions have not relieved me ; but they may account for some otherwise unaccountable phases of humour which I show . He began to pace the room , muttering terrible things to himself , till I was inclined to believe , as he said Joseph did , that conscience had turned his heart to an earthly hell . Though he seldom before had revealed this state of mind , even by looks , it was his habitual mood , I had no doubt : he asserted it himself ; but not a soul , from his general bearing , would have conjectured the fact . You did not when you saw him , Mr. Lockwood : and at the period of which I speak , he was just the same as then ; only fonder of continued solitude , and perhaps still more laconic in company .
