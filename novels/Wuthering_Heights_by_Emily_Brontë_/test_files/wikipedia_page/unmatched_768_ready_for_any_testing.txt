lockwood learns that hareton_earnshaw and miss_cathy plan to marry on new year day mr_heathcliff he and catherine_earnshaw grow close and their love is the central theme of the first volume
mr_heathcliff has been considered byronic hero but critics have pointed out that he reinvents himself at various points making his character hard to fit into any single type
he has an ambiguous position in society and his lack of status is underlined by the fact that mr_heathcliff is both his given name and his surname
his revenge against the man she chooses to marry and its consequences are the central theme of the second volume catherine_earnshaw first introduced to the reader after her death through lockwood discovery of her diary and carvings
the description of her life is confined almost entirely to the first volume she seems unsure whether she is or wants to become more like mr_heathcliff or aspires to be more like mr_edgar
some critics have argued that her decision to marry mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff is allegorically rejection of nature and surrender to culture choice with unfortunate fateful consequences for all the other characters
mr_edgar style and manners are in sharp contrast to those of mr_heathcliff who instantly dislikes him and of catherine_earnshaw who is drawn to him
catherine_earnshaw marries him instead of mr_heathcliff because of his higher social status with disastrous results to all characters in the story
nelly_dean ellen_dean the main narrator of the novel nelly_dean is servant to three generations of the earnshaws and two of the mrs_linton_heathcliff family

mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff introduced as child in the mrs_linton_heathcliff family he resides at thrushcross_grange she is referred to as ellen_dean her given name to show respect and as nelly_dean among those close to her
critics have discussed how far her actions as an apparent bystander affect the other characters and how much her narrative can be relied on
isabella_linton mrs_linton_heathcliff isabella_linton is seen only in relation to other characters although some insight into her thoughts and feelings is provided by the chapter long letter to ellen_dean detailing her arrival at wuthering heights after her marriage to mr_heathcliff
she views mr_heathcliff romantically despite catherine_earnshaw warnings and becomes an unwitting participant in his plot for revenge against mr_edgar mr_heathcliff marries her but treats her abusively

while pregnant she escapes to london and gives birth to son mrs_linton_heathcliff mr_hindley catherine_earnshaw mr_hindley returns with his wife frances after mr catherine_earnshaw dies

nelly_dean work to instill sense of pride in the catherine_earnshaw heritage even though hareton_earnshaw will not inherit catherine_earnshaw property because mr_hindley has mortgaged it to mr_heathcliff
hareton_earnshaw speaks with an accent similar to joseph and occupies position similar to servant at wuthering heights unaware how he has been done out of his inheritance
mr_heathcliff in contrast teaches him vulgarities as way of avenging himself on mr_hindley in appearance he reminds mr_heathcliff of his aunt catherine_earnshaw
mr_edgar is very protective of her and as result she is eager to discover what lies beyond the confines of the grange
although one of the more sympathetic characters of the novel she is also somewhat snobbish towards hareton_earnshaw and his lack of education

he marries miss_cathy mrs_linton_heathcliff because his father who terrifies him directs him to do so and soon after dies from wasting illness associated with tuberculosis
joseph servant at wuthering heights for year who is rigid self righteous christian but lacks any trace of genuine kindness or humanity
in his selfishness and capacity for cruelty he resembles mr_heathcliff he speaks broad yorkshire dialect and hates nearly everyone in the novel
mr_lockwood the first narrator he rents thrushcross_grange to escape society but in the end decides society is preferable he narrates the book until chapter when the main narrator nelly_dean picks up the tale

dr mr_kenneth the longtime doctor of gimmerton_kirk and friend of mr_hindley who is present at the cases of illness during the novel
although not much of his character is known he seems to be rough but honest person zillah servant to mr_heathcliff at wuthering heights during the period following catherine_earnshaw death
although she is kind to lockwood she doesnt like or help miss_cathy at wuthering heights because of miss_cathy arrogance and mr_heathcliff instructions

catherine_earnshaw has been identified by some critics as type of gothic demon because she shape shifts in order to marry mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff by assuming domesticity that is contrary to her true nature
it has also been suggested that catherine_earnshaw relationship with mr_heathcliff conforms to the dynamics of the gothic romance in that the woman falls prey to the more or less demonic instincts of her lover suffers from the violence of his feelings and at the end is entangled by his thwarted passion
at one stage mr_heathcliff is described as vampire and it has been suggested that both he and catherine_earnshaw are in fact meant to be seen as vampire like personalities
ellen_dean moers in literary women developed feminist theory that connects women writers including emily brontë with the gothic fiction the novel was first published together with anne brontë agnes grey in three volume format
in when second edition of wuthering heights was due charlotte brontë edited the original text altering punctuation correcting spelling errors and making joseph thick yorkshire dialect less opaque
williams she mentioned that it seems to me advisable to modify the orthography of the old servant joseph speeches for though as it stands it exactly renders the yorkshire dialect to yorkshire ear yet am sure southerns must find it unintelligible and thus one of the most graphic characters in the book is lost on them
wuthering heights occupied the first two volumes while agnes grey made up the third an essay written by irene wiltshire on dialect and speech in the novel examines some of the changes charlotte made
high sunderland hall in shortly before emily brontë saw the building there are several theories about which real building or buildings if any may have inspired wuthering heights
one common candidate is top withens ruined farmhouse in an isolated area near the haworth parsonage although its structure does not match that of the farmhouse described in the novel
top withens was first suggested as the model by ellen_dean nussey friend of charlotte brontë to edward morison wimperis an artist who was commissioned to illustrate the brontë sisters novels in
the second possibility is high sunderland hall near halifax now demolished this gothic edifice was located near law hill where emily worked briefly as governess in
while it was perhaps grander than wuthering heights the hall had grotesque embellishments of griffins and misshapen nude males similar to those described by lockwood in chapter of the novel
the inspiration for thrushcross_grange has long been traced to ponden hall near haworth which is very small shibden hall near halifax is perhaps more likely
by comparison the park at chatsworth the home of the duke of devonshire is over two miles km long but as the house sits near the middle it is no more than mile and half km from the lodge to the house
the thrushcross_grange that emily describes is rather unusual it sits within an enormous park as does shibden hall considering that mr_edgar mrs_linton_heathcliff apparently does not even have title this seems unlikely
there is no building close to haworth that has park anywhere near this size but there are few house that might have inspired some elements
shibden hall has several features that match descriptions in the novel early reviews of wuthering heights were mixed in their assessment
whilst most critics at the time recognised the power and imagination of the novel they were also baffled by the storyline and found the characters prone to savagery and selfishness
published in at time when the background of the author was deemed to have an important impact on the story itself many critics were also intrigued by the authorship of the novels
henry chorley of the athenæum said that it was disagreeable story and that the bells brontës seem to affect painful and exceptional subjects
the atlas review called it strange inartistic story but commented that every chapter seems to contain sort of rugged power
atlas summarised the novel by writing we know nothing in the whole range of our fictitious literature which presents such shocking pictures of the worst forms of humanity
there is not in the entire dramatis persona single character which is not utterly hateful or thoroughly contemptible even the female characters excite something of loathing and much of contempt
graham lady magazine wrote how human being could have attempted such book as the present without committing suicide before he had finished dozen chapters is mystery
beautiful and loveable in their childhood they all to use vulgar expression turn out badly it is compound of vulgar depravity and unnatural horrors
the american whig review wrote respecting book so original as this and written with so much power of imagination it is natural that there should be many opinions
indeed its power is so predominant that it is not easy after hasty reading to analyze one impressions so as to speak of its merits and demerits with confidence
we have been taken and carried through new region melancholy waste with here and there patches of beauty have been brought in contact with fierce passions with extremes of love and hate and with sorrow that none but those who have suffered can understand
this has not been accomplished with ease but with an ill mannered contempt for the decencies of language and in style which might resemble that of yorkshire farmer who should have endeavored to eradicate his provincialism by taking lessons of london footman
we have had many sad bruises and tumbles in our journey yet it was interesting and at length we are safely arrived at happy conclusion
douglas jerrold weekly newspaper wrote wuthering heights is strange sort of book baffling all regular criticism yet it is impossible to begin and not finish it and quite as impossible to lay it aside afterwards and say nothing about
in wuthering heights the reader is shocked disgusted almost sickened by details of cruelty inhumanity and the most diabolical hate and vengeance and anon come passages of powerful testimony to the supreme power of love even over demons in the human form
the women in the book are of strange fiendish angelic nature tantalising and terrible and the man are indescribable out of the book itself
we strongly recommend all our readers who love novelty to get this story for we can promise them that they never have read anything like it before
it is very puzzling and very interesting and if we had space we would willingly devote little more time to the analysis of this remarkable story but we must leave it to our readers to decide what sort of book it is
new monthly magazine wrote wuthering heights by ellis bell is terrific story associated with an equally fearful and repulsive spot our novel reading experience does not enable us to refer to anything to be compared with the personages we are introduced to at this desolate spot a perfect misanthropist heaven
yet towards the close of the story occurs the following pretty soft picture which comes like the rainbow after storm tait edinburgh magazine wrote this novel contains undoubtedly powerful writing and yet it seems to be thrown away
mr ellis bell before constructing the novel should have known that forced marriages under threats and in confinement are illegal and parties instrumental thereto can be punished
and second that wills made by young ladies minors are invalid the volumes are powerfully written records of wickedness and they have moral they show what satan could do with the law of entail
it is not without evidences of considerable power but as whole it is wild confused disjointed and improbable and the people who make up the drama which is tragic enough in its consequences are savages ruder than those who lived before the day of homer
literary world wrote in the whole story not single trait of character is elicited which can command our admiration not one of the fine feelings of our nature seems to have formed part in the composition of its principal actors
in spite of the disgusting coarsness of much of the dialogue and the improbabilities of much of the plot we are spellbound
although mostly hostile it notes that the book is illuminated by some gleams of sunshine towards the end which serve to cast grateful light on the dreary path we have traveled
lewes in leader shortly after emily death wrote curious enough is to read wuthering heights and the tenant of wildfell hall and remember that the writers were two retiring solitary consumptive girls
book coarse even for man coarse in language and coarse in conception the coarseness apparently of violence and uncultivated man turn out to be the productions of two girls living almost alone filling their loneliness with quiet studies and writing their book from sense of duty hating the pictures they drew yet drawing them with austere conscientiousness
examiner wrote this is strange book britannia called it strangely original book that depicts humanity in this wild state there is matter here for the moralist or critic to speculate on

it uses quotations from catherine_earnshaw both in the chorus let me in and the verses with catherine_earnshaw admitting she had bad dreams in the night
critic sheila whiteley wrote that the ethereal quality of the vocal resonates with miss_cathy dementia and that bush high register has both childlike qualities in its purity of tone and an underlying eroticism in its sinuous erotic contours
the song is sung from catherine_earnshaw point of view as she pleads at mr_heathcliff window to be admitted singer pat benatar also released the song in on the crimes of passion album
