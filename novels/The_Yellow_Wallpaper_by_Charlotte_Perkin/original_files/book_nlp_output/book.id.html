<p/>A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and reach the height of romantic felicity--but that would be asking too much of fate!
<p/>Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it. Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long untenanted?
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has no patience with faith, an intense horror of superstition, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) scoffs openly at any talk of things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.
<p/>John is a physician, and PERHAPS---LRB-I would not say it to a living soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my mind-RRB---PERHAPS that is one reason I do not get well faster.
<p/>John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage. John is practical in the extreme. You see he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does not believe I am sick!
<p/>If a physician of high standing, and one's own husband, assures friends and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but temporary nervous depression--a slight hysterical tendency--what is one to do?
<p/>And what can one do? My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) says the same thing.
<p/>So I take phosphates or phosphites--whichever it is, and tonics, and journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to <div class="bookquote">``work''  (<font color='red'><b>tonics</b></font>)</div>until I am well again.
<p/>Personally, I disagree with their ideas. Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change, would do me good. But what is one to do?
<p/>I did write for a while in spite of them; but it DOES exhaust me a good deal--having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy opposition.
<p/>I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more society and stimulus--but John says the very worst thing I can do is to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.
<p/>So I will let it alone and talk about the house. The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the road, quite three miles from the village.
<p/>It makes me think of English places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.
<p/>I never saw such a garden--large and shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered arbors with seats under them.
<p/>There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and coheirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.
<p/>There is a DELICIOUS garden! There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now. That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid, but I don't care
<p/>I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said what I felt was a DRAUGHT, and shut the window.
<p/>--there is something strange about the house--I can feel it. I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I'm sure I never used to be so sensitive.
<p/>But John says if I feel so, I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take pains to control myself--before him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), at least, and that makes me very tired.
<p/>I wanted one downstairs that opened on the piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned chintz hangings!
<p/>I think it is due to this nervous condition. I don't like our room a bit. but John would not hear of it.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near room for him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took another.
<p/>I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) takes all care from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest and all the air I could get.
<p/>Your exercise depends on your strength, my dear,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``and your food somewhat on your appetite; but air you can absorb all the time.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special direction. ''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' So we took the nursery at the top of the house.
<p/>It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all ways, and air and sunshine galore.
<p/>, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little children, and there are rings and things in the walls.
<p/>It was nursery first and then playroom and gymnasium The paint and paper look as if a boys' school had used it.
<p/>It is stripped off--the paper--in great patches all around the head of my bed, about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the room low down.
<p/>It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to constantly irritate and provoke study, and when you follow the lame uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide--plunge off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard of contradictions.
<p/>I never saw a worse paper in my life. One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin. The color is repellent, almost revolting; a smouldering unclean yellow, strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.
<p/>It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in others. No wonder the children hated it!
<p/>I should hate it myself if I had to live in this room long. There comes John, and I must put this away,--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) hates to have me write a word.
<p/>I am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength.
<p/>We have been here two weeks, and I haven't felt like writing before, since that first day. John is away all day, and even some nights when his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cases are serious.
<p/>I am glad my case is not serious! But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing. John does not know how much I really suffer.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knows there is no REASON to suffer, and that satisfies him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty in any way!
<p/>I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here I am a comparative burden already!
<p/>Nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able,--to dress and entertain, and order things.
<p/>It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby! And yet I CANNOT be with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), it makes me so nervous.
<p/>At first he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said that I was letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous patient than to give way to such fancies.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) said that after the wall-paper was changed it would be the heavy bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of the stairs, and so on.
<p/>You know the place is doing you good,'' he (<font color='blue'><b>patient</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">``and really, dear, I don't care to renovate the house just for a three months' rental.''
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>I suppose John never was nervous in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) life. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) laughs at me so about this wall-paper! '' <div class="bookquote">``Then do let us go downstairs,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I said, <div class="bookquote">``there are such pretty rooms there.
<p/>Then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) took me in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arms and called me a blessed little goose, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would go down to the cellar, if I wished, and have it whitewashed into the bargain.
<p/>It is an airy and comfortable room as any one need wish, and, of course, I would not be so silly as to make him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) uncomfortable just for a whim.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is right enough about the beds and windows and things. I'm really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid paper.
<p/>Out of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deepshaded arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.
<p/>Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down there from the house.
<p/>I see people walking in these numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to fancy in the least.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) says that with my imaginative power and habit of story-making, a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to check the tendency.
<p/>I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it would relieve the press of ideas and rest me.
<p/>I always fancy So I try. But I find I get pretty tired when I try. It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my work.
<p/>When I get really well, John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia down for a long visit; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would as soon put fireworks in my pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.
<p/>I wish I could get well faster. But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it KNEW what a vicious influence it had!
<p/>There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and two bulbous eyes stare at you upside down.
<p/>I get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd, unblinking eyes are everywhere.
<p/>There is one place where two breadths didn't match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little higher than the other.
<p/>I used to lie awake as a child and get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than most children could find in a toy store.
<p/>I remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big, old bureau used to have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.
<p/>I used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could always hop into that chair and be safe.
<p/>I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all know how much expression they have! The furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for we had to bring it all from downstairs.
<p/>I suppose when this was used as a playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I never saw such ravages as the children have made here.
<p/>The wall-paper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh closer than a brother--they must have had perseverance as well as hatred.
<p/>Then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster itself is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed which is all we found in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.
<p/>But I don't mind it a bit--only the paper. There comes John's sister. Such a dear girl as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is, and so careful of me!
<p/>I must not let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) find me writing. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better profession.
<p/>I verily believe she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) thinks it is the writing which made me sick! But I can write when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is out, and see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a long way off from these windows.
<p/>There is one that commands the road, a lovely shaded winding road, and one that just looks off over the country.
<p/>This wall-paper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights, and not clearly then.
<p/>But in the places where it isn't faded and where the sun is just so--I can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to skulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.
<p/>A lovely country, too, full of great elms and velvet meadows. There's sister on the stairs! Well, the Fourth of July is over!
<p/>John thought it might do me good to see a little company, so we just had mother and Nellie and the children down for a week.
<p/>The people are gone and I am tired out. Of course I didn't do a thing. Jennie sees to everything now.
<p/>But it tired me all the same. John says if I don't pick up faster he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) shall send me to Weir Mitchell in the fall.
<p/>I had a friend who was in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hands once, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is just like John and my brother, only more so!
<p/>I don't feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for anything, and I'm getting dreadfully fretful and querulous.
<p/>But I don't want to go there at all. Besides, it is such an undertaking to go so far. I cry at nothing, and cry most of the time.
<p/>Of course I don't when John is here, or anybody else, but when I am alone. And I am alone a good deal just now.
<p/>John is kept in town very often by serious cases, and Jennie is good and lets me alone when I want her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) to.
<p/>So I walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane, sit on the porch under the roses, and lie down up here a good deal.
<p/>I'm getting really fond of the room in spite of the wall-paper. Perhaps BECAUSE of the wall-paper. It dwells in my mind so!
<p/>I lie here on this great immovable bed--it is nailed down, I believe--and follow that pattern about by the hour. It is as good as gymnastics, I assure you.
<p/>I start, we'll say, at the bottom, down in the corner over there where it has not been touched, and I determine for the thousandth time that I WILL follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a conclusion.
<p/>I know a little of the principle of design, and I know this thing was not arranged on any laws of radiation, or alternation, or repetition, or symmetry, or anything else that I ever heard of.
<p/>Looked at in one way each breadth stands alone, the bloated curves and flourishes--a kind of <div class="bookquote">``debased Romanesque''  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with delirium tremens--go waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity.
<p/>But, on the other hand, they connect diagonally, and the sprawling outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror, like a lot of wallowing seaweeds in full chase.
<p/>The whole thing goes horizontally, too, at least it seems so, and I exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that direction.
<p/>It is repeated, of course, by the breadths, but not otherwise. They have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze, and that adds wonderfully to the confusion.
<p/>There is one end of the room where it is almost intact, and there, when the crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it, I can almost fancy radiation after all,--the interminable grotesques seem to form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal distraction.
<p/>It makes me tired to follow it. I will take a nap I guess. I don't know why I should write this.
<p/>I don't want to. I don't feel able. And I know John would think it absurd. But I MUST say what I feel and think in some way--it is such a relief!
<p/>But the effort is getting to be greater than the relief. Half the time now I am awfully lazy, and lie down ever so much.
<p/>John says I musn't lose my strength, and has me take cod liver oil and lots of tonics and things, to say nothing of ale and wine and rare meat.
<p/>I tried to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) the other day, and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) how I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would let me go and make a visit to Cousin Henry and Julia.
<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said I wasn't able to go, nor able to stand it after I got there; and I did not make out a very good case for myself, for I was crying before I had finished.
<p/>Dear John! He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) loves me very dearly, and hates to have me sick. It is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight.
<p/>And dear John gathered me up in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) arms, and just carried me upstairs and laid me on the bed, and sat by me and read to me till it tired my head.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said I was his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) darling and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) comfort and all he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had, and that I must take care of myself for his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sake, and keep well.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) says no one but myself can help me out of it, that I must use my will and self-control and not let any silly fancies run away with me.
<p/>There's one comfort, the baby is well and happy, and does not have to occupy this nursery with the horrid wall-paper.
<p/>Just this nervous weakness I suppose. If we had not used it, that blessed child would have! What a fortunate escape!
<p/>I never thought of it before, but it is lucky that John kept me here after all, I can stand it so much easier than a baby, you see.
<p/>Why, I wouldn't have a child of mine, an impressionable little thing, live in such a room for worlds. Of course I never mention it to them any more--I am too wise,--but
<p/>I keep watch of it all the same. There are things in that paper that nobody knows but me, or ever will.
<p/>Behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day. It is always the same shape, only very numerous. And it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that pattern.
<p/>It is so hard to talk with John about my case, because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is so wise, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) loves me so.
<p/>I don't like it a bit. I wonder--I begin to think--I wish John would take me away from here! But I tried it last night.
<p/>It was moonlight. The moon shines in all around just as the sun does. I hate to see it sometimes, it creeps so slowly, and always comes in by one window or another.
<p/>John was asleep and I hated to waken him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), so I kept still and watched the moonlight on that undulating wall-paper till I felt creepy.
<p/>I got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper DID move, and when I came back John was awake.
<p/>The faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern, just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) wanted to get out. '' What is it, little girl?
<p/>I though it was a good time to talk, so I told him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that I really was not gaining here, and that I wished he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would take me away.
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said. '' Don't go walking about like that--you'll get cold. '' '' Why darling!'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``our lease will be up in three weeks, and I can't see how to leave before.
<p/>Of course if you were in any danger, I could and would, but you really are better, dear, whether you can see it or not.
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The repairs are not done at home, and I cannot possibly leave town just now. I am a doctor, dear, and I know.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``I don't weigh a bit more,''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, <div class="bookquote">``nor as much; and my appetite may be better in the evening when you are here, but it is worse in the morning when you are away!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>You are gaining flesh and color, your appetite is better, I feel really much easier about you.'' <div class="bookquote">``Bless her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) little heart!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) with a big hug, <div class="bookquote">``she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shall be as sick as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) pleases!
<p/>But now let's improve the shining hours by going to sleep, and talk about it in the morning!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>'' And you won't go away?
<p/>It is only three weeks more and then we will take a nice little trip of a few days while Jennie is getting the house ready.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``Better in body perhaps--''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I began, and stopped short, for he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) sat up straight and looked at me with such a stern, reproachful look that I could not say another word.
<p/>My darling,'' said he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">``I beg of you, for my sake and for our child's sake, as well as for your own, that you will never for one instant let that idea enter your mind!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I asked gloomily. '' Why, how can I, dear? Really dear you are better!'' '' There is nothing so dangerous, so fascinating, to a temperament like yours.
<p/>It is a false and foolish fancy. Can you not trust me as a physician when I tell you so? ''
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) thought I was asleep first, but I wasn't, and lay there for hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern really did move together or separately.
<p/>On a pattern like this, by daylight, there is a lack of sequence, a defiance of law, that is a constant irritant to a normal mind.
<p/>So of course I said no more on that score, and we went to sleep before long. The color is hideous enough, and unreliable enough, and infuriating enough, but the pattern is torturing.
<p/>You think you have mastered it, but just as you get well underway in following, it turns a back-somersault and there you are.
<p/>It slaps you in the face, knocks you down, and tramples upon you. It is like a bad dream. The outside pattern is a florid arabesque, reminding one of a fungus.
<p/>If you can imagine a toadstool in joints, an interminable string of toadstools, budding and sprouting in endless convolutions--why, that is something like it.
<p/>There is one marked peculiarity about this paper, a thing nobody seems to notice but myself, and that is that it changes as the light changes.
<p/>When the sun shoots in through the east window--I always watch for that first long, straight ray--it changes so quickly that I never can quite believe it.
<p/>That is, sometimes! That is why I watch it always. By moonlight--the moon shines in all night when there is a moon--I wouldn't know it was the same paper.
<p/>At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candle light, lamplight, and worst of all by moonlight, it becomes bars!
<p/>I didn't realize for a long time what the thing was that showed behind, that dim sub-pattern, but now I am quite sure it is a woman.
<p/>The outside pattern I mean, and the woman behind it is as plain as can be. By daylight she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is subdued, quiet.
<p/>I fancy it is the pattern that keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) so still. It is so puzzling. It keeps me quiet by the hour.
<p/>I lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep all I can. Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each meal.
<p/>It is a very bad habit I am convinced, for you see I don't sleep. And that cultivates deceit, for I don't tell them
<p/>I'm awake-- O no! The fact is I am getting a little afraid of John. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) seems very queer sometimes, and even Jennie has an inexplicable look.
<p/>I have watched John when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did not know I was looking, and come into the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I've caught him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) several times LOOKING AT THE PAPER!
<p/>It strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis,--that perhaps it is the paper! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) hand on it once.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) didn't know I was in the room, and when I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) in a quiet, a very quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) was doing with the paper--she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) turned around as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) had been caught stealing, and looked quite angry--asked me why I should frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) so!
<p/>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John's, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) wished we would be more careful!
<p/>Did not that sound innocent? But I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) was studying that pattern, and I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!
<p/>Life is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch.
<p/>I really do eat better, and am more quiet than I was. John is so pleased to see me improve! He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) laughed a little the other day, and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wall-paper.
<p/>I turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) it was BECAUSE of the wall-paper--he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would make fun of me.
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might even want to take me away. I don't want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week more, and I think that will be enough.
<p/>I don't sleep much at night, for it is so interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the daytime.
<p/>I'm feeling ever so much better! In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing. There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all over it.
<p/>It makes me think of all the yellow things I ever saw--not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old foul, bad yellow things.
<p/>I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried conscientiously. It is the strangest yellow, that wall-paper! But there is something else about that paper--the smell!
<p/>I noticed it the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was not bad.
<p/>Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows are open or not, the smell is here.
<p/>I find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.
<p/>It creeps all over the house. It gets into my hair. Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it--there is that smell!
<p/>Such a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it, to find what it smelled like. It is not bad--at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest, most enduring odor I ever met.
<p/>In this damp weather it is awful, I wake up in the night and find it hanging over me. It used to disturb me at first.
<p/>I thought seriously of burning the house--to reach the smell. But now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like is the COLOR of the paper!
<p/>A yellow smell. There is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A streak that runs round the room.
<p/>It goes behind every piece of furniture, except the bed, a long, straight, even SMOOCH, as if it had been rubbed over and over.
<p/>I wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round and round and round--round and round and round--it makes me dizzy!
<p/>I really have discovered something at last. Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally found out.
<p/>Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only one, and she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) crawls around fast, and her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) crawling shakes it all over.
<p/>Then in the very bright spots she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) keeps still, and in the very shady spots she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.
<p/>The front pattern DOES move--and no wonder! The woman behind shakes it! And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is all the time trying to climb through.
<p/>But nobody could climb through that pattern-- it strangles so ; I think that is why it has so many heads.
<p/>They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them upside down, and makes their eyes white! If those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.
<p/>I think that woman gets out in the daytime! And I'll tell you why--privately--I've seen her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)! I can see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out of every one of my windows!
<p/>I see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a carriage comes she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hides under the blackberry vines.
<p/>It is the same woman, I know, for she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is always creeping, and most women do not creep by daylight. I don't blame her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a bit.
<p/>It must be very humiliating to be caught creeping by daylight! I always lock the door when I creep by daylight.
<p/>I can't do it at night, for I know John would suspect something at once. And John is so queer now, that I don't want to irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would take another room! Besides, I don't want anybody to get that woman out at night but myself.
<p/>I often wonder if I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) out of all the windows at once. But, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.
<p/>I have watched her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.
<p/>And though I always see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) MAY be able to creep faster than I can turn! If only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one!
<p/>I mean to try it, little by little. I have found out another funny thing, but I shan't tell it this time!
<p/>It does not do to trust people too much. There are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John is beginning to notice.
<p/>I don't like the look in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eyes. And I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me.
<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) had a very good report to give. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) said I slept a good deal in the daytime. John knows I don't sleep very well at night, for all I'm so quiet!
<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving and kind. As if I couldn't see through him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)!
<p/>Still, I don't wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) acts so, sleeping under this paper for three months. It only interests me, but I feel sure John and Jennie are secretly affected by it.
<p/>Hurrah! This is the last day, but it is enough. John is to stay in town over night, and won't be out until this evening.
<p/>Jennie wanted to sleep with me--the sly thing! but I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) I should undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone.
<p/>As soon as it was moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern, I got up and ran to help her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>).
<p/>I pulled and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) shook, I shook and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) pulled, and before morning we had peeled off yards of that paper.
<p/>That was clever, for really I wasn't alone a bit! A strip about as high as my head and half around the room.
<p/>And then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me, I declared I would finish it to-day!
<p/>Jennie looked at the wall in amazement, but I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) merrily that I did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing.
<p/>We go away to-morrow, and they are moving all my furniture down again to leave things as they were before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) laughed and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) wouldn't mind doing it herself, but I must not get tired.
<p/>How she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) betrayed herself that time! But I am here, and no person touches this paper but me--not ALIVE! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) tried to get me out of the room--it was too patent!
<p/>But I said it was so quiet and empty and clean now that I believed I would lie down again and sleep all I could; and not to wake me even for dinner
<p/>So now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>) is gone, and the servants are gone, and the things are gone, and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down, with the canvas mattress we found on it.
<p/>--I would call when I woke. We shall sleep downstairs to-night, and take the boat home to-morrow. I quite enjoy the room, now it is bare again.
<p/>How those children did tear about here! This bedstead is fairly gnawed! But I must get to work. I have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path.
<p/>I don't want to go out, and I don't want to have anybody come in, till John comes. I want to astonish him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>).
<p/>I've got a rope up here that even Jennie did not find. If that woman does get out, and tries to get away, I can tie her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennie</b></font>)!
<p/>I tried to lift and push it until I was lame, and then I got so angry I bit off a little piece at one corner--but it hurt my teeth.
<p/>But I forgot I could not reach far without anything to stand on! This bed will NOT move! Then I peeled off all the paper I could reach standing on the floor.
<p/>It sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it! All those strangled heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with derision!
<p/>I am getting angry enough to do something desperate. To jump out of the window would be admirable exercise, but the bars are too strong even to try.
<p/>Besides I wouldn't do it. Of course not. I know well enough that a step like that is improper and might be misconstrued.
<p/>I don't like to LOOK out of the windows even--there are so many of those creeping women, and they creep so fast.
<p/>I wonder if they all come out of that wall-paper as I did? But I am securely fastened now by my well-hidden rope--you don't get ME out in the road there!
<p/>I suppose I shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes night, and that is hard! It is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as I please!
<p/>I don't want to go outside. I won't, even if Jennie asks me to. For outside you have to creep on the ground, and everything is green instead of yellow.
<p/>But here I can creep smoothly on the floor, and my shoulder just fits in that long smooch around the wall, so I cannot lose my way.
<p/>Why there's John at the door! It is no use, young man, you can't open it! How he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does call and pound!
<p/>Now he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)'s crying for an axe. It would be a shame to break down that beautiful door! '' John dear!'' said I in the gentlest voice, <div class="bookquote">``the key is down by the front steps, under a plantain leaf!
<p/>''  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That silenced him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) for a few moments. Then he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) said--very quietly indeed, <div class="bookquote">``Open the door, my darling!''  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">``I can't,''  (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div>said I.
<p/>And then I said it again, several times, very gently and slowly, and said it so often that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had to go and see, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) got it of course, and came in.
<p/><div class="bookquote">``The key is down by the front door under a plantain leaf! ''  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stopped short by the door. '' What is the matter?
<p/>'' he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cried. '' For God's sake, what are you doing! '' I kept on creeping just the same, but I looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) over my shoulder.
<p/>'' I've got out at last,'' said I, <div class="bookquote">``in spite of you and Jane. And I've pulled off most of the paper, so you can't put me back!''
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did, and right across my path by the wall, so that I had to creep over him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) every time!
