the next morning his #sister# comes in sees that he has not touched the milk takes it away and presents him with different types of food
initially excited he quickly discovers that he has no taste for milk once one of his favorites $gregor$ happily eats the rotten food and leaves the fresh food untouched
this begins routine in which his #sister# feeds him and cleans up while he hides under the couch afraid that his appearance will frighten her
$gregor$ spends his time listening through the wall to his family members talking they often discuss the difficult financial situation they find themselves in now that $gregor$ cant provide them any help
$gregor$ had plans of sending $grete$ to the conservatory to pursue violin lessons something everyone else including $grete$ considered dream his inability to provide for his family coupled with his speechlessness greatly reduce his thought processes
$gregor$ also learns that his #mother# wants to visit him but his #sister# and #father# will not let her $gregor$ grows more comfortable with his changed body
he begins climbing the walls and ceiling for amusement discovering $gregor$ new pastime $grete$ decides to remove some of the furniture to give $gregor$ more space
she and her #mother# begin taking furniture away but $gregor$ finds their actions deeply distressing he tries to save picture on the wall of woman wearing fur hat fur scarf and fur muff
$gregor$ #mother# sees him hanging on the wall and passes out $grete$ angrily calls out to $gregor$ the first time anyone has spoken directly to him since his transformation
$gregor$ runs out of the #room# and into the kitchen he encounters his #father# who has just returned home from work
the #father# throws apples at $gregor$ and one of them sinks into sensitive spot in his back and remains lodged there paralyzing his movements for month and damaging him permanently
one evening the cleaning lady leaves $gregor$ #door# open while three lodgers whom the family has taken on for additional income lounge about the living #room#
$grete$ has been asked to play the violin for them and $gregor$ who usually takes care to avoid crossing paths with anyone in the flat creeps out of his bedroom to listen in the midst of his depression and resultant detachment
$gregor$ manages to get back into his bedroom but is severely injured the lodgers who initially seemed interested in $grete$ grow bored with her performance but $gregor$ is transfixed by it
$gregor$ #father# tries to shove the lodgers back into their #room# but the three men protest and announce that they will move out immediately without paying rent because of the disgusting conditions in the apartment
$grete$ who has by now become tired of taking care of $gregor$ and is realizing the burden his existence puts on each one in the family tells her parents they must get rid of $gregor$ or they will all be ruined
one of the lodgers spots $gregor$ and the rest become alarmed her #father# agrees wishing $gregor$ could understand them and would leave of his own accord
there determined to rid his family of his presence $gregor$ dies from starvation because he was so depressed he refused to eat
$gregor$ does in fact understand and slowly moves back to the bedroom upon discovering $gregor$ is dead the family feels great sense of relief
the #father# kicks out the boarders and decides to fire the cleaning lady who has disposed of $gregor$ body the family takes trolley ride out to the countryside during which they consider their finances
they decide to move to smaller apartment to further save money an act they were unable to carry out in $gregor$ presence
during this short trip mr and mrs $mr_samsa$ realize that in spite of going through hardships which have brought an amount of paleness to her face $grete$ appears to have grown up into pretty and well figured lady which leads her parents to think about finding her husband
$gregor$ is the main character of the story he works as traveling salesman in order to provide money for his #sister# and parents
after the metamorphosis $gregor$ becomes unable to work and is confined to his #room# for most of the remainder of the story
he wakes up one morning finding himself transformed into an insect this prompts his family to begin working once again $gregor$ is depicted as isolated from society and often misunderstands the true intentions of others
the name $gregor$ $mr_samsa$ appears to derive partly from literary works kafka had read a character in the story of young renate fuchs by german jewish novelist jakob wassermann is named $gregor$ samassa
the viennese author leopold von sacher masoch whose sexual imagination gave rise to the idea of masochism is also an influence
a venus in furs literally recurs in the metamorphosis in the picture that $gregor$ $mr_samsa$ has hung on his bedroom wall
sacher masoch wrote venus in furs a novel whose hero assumes the name $gregor$ at one point $grete$ is $gregor$ younger #sister# who becomes his caretaker after his metamorphosis
while $grete$ initially volunteers to feed him and clean his #room# she grows increasingly impatient with the burden and begins to leave his #room# in disarray out of spite
her initial decision to take care of $gregor$ may have come from desire to contribute and be useful to the family since she becomes angry and upset when the #mother# cleans his #room# and it is made clear that $grete$ is disgusted by $gregor$ she could not enter $gregor$ #room# without opening the window first because of the nausea he caused her and leaves without doing anything if $gregor$ is in plain sight
she plays the violin and dreams of going to the conservatory dream $gregor$ had intended to make happen $gregor$ had planned on making the announcement on christmas day
initially $grete$ and $gregor$ have close relationship but this quickly fades to help provide an income for the family after $gregor$ transformation she starts working as salesgirl
at the end of the story $grete$ parents realize that she has become beautiful and full figured and decide to consider finding her husband
$grete$ is also the first to suggest getting rid of $gregor$ which causes $gregor$ to plan his own death after the metamorphosis he is forced to return to work in order to support the family financially
his attitude towards his son is harsh he regards the transformed $gregor$ with disgust and possibly even fear and he attacks him on multiple occasions
mrs $mr_samsa$ is $grete$ and $gregor$ #mother# she is initially shocked at $gregor$ transformation however she wants to enter his #room#
this proves too much for her thus giving rise to conflict between her maternal impulse and sympathy and her fear and revulsion at $gregor$ new form
the charwoman is an old lady who is employed by the $mr_samsa$ family to help take care of their household duties
apart from $grete$ and her #father# she is the only person who is in close contact with $gregor$ she is the one who notices that $gregor$ had died and disposes of his body
like most kafka works the metamorphosis tends to entail the use of religious max brod or psychological interpretation by most of its interpreters
it has been particularly common to read the story as an expression of kafka #father# complex as was first done by charles neider in his the frozen sea
besides the psychological approach interpretations focusing on sociological aspects which see the $mr_samsa$ family as portrayal of general social circumstances have gained large following as well
he instead chose an interpretation guided by the artistic detail but categorically excluded any and all attempts at deciphering symbolical or allegorical level of meaning
arguing against the popular #father# complex theory he observed that it is the #sister# more so than the #father# who should be considered the cruelest person in the story as she is the one backstabbing $gregor$
as the central narrative theme he makes out the artist struggle for existence in society replete with philistines that destroys him step by step
study of franz kafka vladimir nabokov rejected such interpretations noting that they do not live up to kafka art commenting on kafka style he writes
the transparency of his style underlines the dark richness of his fantasy world contrast and uniformity style and the depicted portrayal and fable are seamlessly intertwined german
die durchsichtigkeit seines stils betont den dunklen reichtum seiner phantasiewelt gegensatz und einheitlichkeit stil und dargestelltes darstellung und fabel sind in vollkommener weise ineinander verwoben
in nina pelikan straus wrote feminist interpretation of metamorphosis bringing to the forefront the transformation of the main character $gregor$ #sister# $grete$ and foregrounding the family and particularly younger #sister# transformation in the story
traditionally critics of metamorphosis have underplayed the fact that the story is not only about $gregor$ but also his family and especially $grete$ metamorphosis as it is mainly $grete$ woman daughter #sister# on whom the social and psychoanalytic resonances of the text depend
in gerhard rieck pointed out that $gregor$ and his #sister# $grete$ form pair which is typical for many of kafka texts it is made up of one passive rather austere person and another active more libidinal person
the appearance of figures with such almost irreconcilable personalities who form couples in kafka works has been evident since he wrote his short story description of struggle g the narrator young man and his acquaintance
they also appear in the judgement georg and his friend in russia in all three of his novels g robinson and delamarche in amerika as well as in his short stories country doctor the country doctor and the groom and hunger artist the hunger artist and the panther
rieck views these pairs as parts of one single person hence the similarity between the names $gregor$ and $grete$ and in the final analysis as the two determining components of the author personality
not only in kafka life but also in his oeuvre does rieck see the description of fight between these two parts
reiner stach argued in that no elucidating comments were needed to illustrate the story and that it was convincing by itself self contained even absolute
he believes that there is no doubt the story would have been admitted to the canon of world literature even if we had known nothing about its author
reduced to carrying out his professional responsibilities anxious to guarantee his advancement and vexed with the fear of making commercial mistakes he is the creature of functionalistic professional life
in ralf sudau took the view that particular attention should be paid to the motifs of self abnegation and disregard for reality
$gregor$ earlier behavior was characterized by self renunciation and his pride in being able to provide secure and leisured existence for his family
when he finds himself in situation where he himself is in need of attention and assistance and in danger of becoming parasite he doesnt want to admit this new role to himself and be disappointed by the treatment he receives from his family which is becoming more and more careless and even hostile over time
according to sundau $gregor$ is self denyingly hiding his nauseating appearance under the canapé and gradually famishing thus pretty much complying with the more or less blatant wish of his family
his gradual emaciation and self reduction shows signs of fatal hunger strike which on the part of $gregor$ is unconscious and unsuccessful on the part of his family not understood or ignored
p also lists the names of selected interpreters of the metamorphosis g according to them the narrative is metaphor for the suffering resulting from leprosy an escape into the disease or symptom onset an image of an existence which is defaced by the career or revealing staging which cracks the veneer and superficiality of everyday circumstances and exposes its cruel essence
he further notes that kafka representational style is on one hand characterized by an idiosyncratic interpenetration of realism and fantasy worldly mind rationality and clarity of observation and on the other hand by folly outlandishness and fallacy
according to peter andré alt the figure of the vermin becomes drastic expression of $gregor$ $mr_samsa$ deprived existence sudau he also points to the grotesque and tragicomical silent film like elements
he derives his interpretative approach from the fact that the descriptions of $gregor$ and his family environment in the metamorphosis contradict each other
diametrically opposed versions exist of $gregor$ back his voice of whether he is ill or already undergoing the metamorphosis whether he is dreaming or not which treatment he deserves of his moral point of view false accusations made by $grete$ and whether his family is blameless or not
fernando bermejo rubio argued that the story is often viewed unjustly as inconclusive bermejo rubio emphasizes that kafka ordered in that there should be no illustration of $gregor$
he argues that it is exactly this absence of visual narrator that is essential for kafka project for he who depicts $gregor$ would stylize himself as an omniscient narrator
another reason why kafka opposed such an illustration is that the reader should not be biased in any way before his reading process was getting under way
that the descriptions are not compatible with each other is indicative of the fact that the opening statement is not to be trusted
if the reader isnt hoodwinked by the first sentence and still thinks of $gregor$ as human being he will view the story as conclusive and realize that $gregor$ is victim of his own degeneration
volker drüke believes that the crucial metamorphosis in the story is that of $grete$ she is the character the title is directed at
$gregor$ metamorphosis is followed by him languishing and ultimately dying $grete$ by contrast has matured as result of the new family circumstances and assumed responsibility
in the end after the brother death the parents also notice that their daughter who was getting more animated all the time had blossomed into beautiful and voluptuous young woman and want to look for partner for her
dependency tree illustrating the difference in syntax between the first sentence of kafka the metamorphosis in translation by ian johnston and in the original german kafka sentences often deliver an unexpected impact just before the period that being the finalizing meaning and focus
this is achieved from the construction of sentences in the original german where the verbs of subordinate clauses are put at the end
for example in the opening sentence it is the final word verwandelt that indicates transformation as $gregor$ $mr_samsa$ awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into gigantic insect like creature
these constructions are not directly translatable to english so it is up to the translator to provide the reader with the effect of the original text
from this standpoint $grete$ transition her metamorphosis from girl into woman is the subtextual theme of the story english translators have often sought to render the word ungeziefer as insect but this is not strictly accurate
in middle high german ungeziefer literally means unclean animal not suitable for sacrifice and is sometimes used colloquially to mean bug a very general term unlike the scientific sounding insect
kafka had no intention of labeling $gregor$ as any specific thing but instead wanted to convey $gregor$ disgust at his transformation
however in kafka letter to his publisher of october in which he discusses his concern about the cover illustration for the first edition he uses the term insekt saying the insect itself is not to be drawn
the phrasing used by joachim neugroschel whereas david wyllie says transformed in his bed into horrible vermin it is not even to be seen from distance
the term dung beetle or mistkäfer is in fact used by the cleaning lady near the end of the story but it is not used in the narration at first she also called him to her with words which she presumably thought were friendly like
ungeziefer has sometimes been translated as cockroach dung beetle beetle and other highly specific terms come here for bit old dung beetle
or hey look at the old dung beetle ungeziefer also denotes sense of separation between himself and his environment he is unclean and must therefore be secluded
vladimir nabokov who was lepidopterist as well as writer and literary critic insisted that $gregor$ was not cockroach but beetle with wings under his shell and capable of flight
in his accompanying lecture notes nabokov discusses the type of insect $gregor$ has been transformed into concluding that $gregor$ is not technically dung beetle
nabokov left sketch annotated just over three feet long on the opening page of his heavily corrected english teaching copy fischer verlag frankfurt am main and hamburg
