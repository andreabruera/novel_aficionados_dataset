the time_traveller machine is science fiction novella by g wells published in and written as frame narrative the term time_traveller machine coined by wells is now almost universally used to refer to such vehicle
the time_traveller machine has been adapted into three feature films of the same name as well as two television versions and large number of comic book adaptations
subtext of the names eloi and morlock wells had considered the notion of time_traveller travel before in short story titled the chronic argonauts
it has also indirectly inspired many more works of fiction in many media productions this work published in his college newspaper was the foundation for the time_traveller machine
wells frequently stated that he had thought of using some of this material in series of articles in the pall mall gazette until the publisher asked him if he could instead write serial novel on the same theme
wells readily agreed and was paid equal to about today on its publication by heinemann in which first published the story in serial form in the january to may numbers of the new review newly under the nominal editorship of e on may heinemann published an english edition on may these two editions are different textually and are commonly referred to as the holt text and heinemann text respectively
the story reflects wells own socialist political views his view on life and abundance and the contemporary angst about industrial relations
it is also influenced by ray lankester theories about social degeneration and shares many elements with edward bulwer lytton novel vril the power of the coming race
other science fiction works of the period including edward bellamy novel looking backward and the later film metropolis dealt with similar themes
nearly all modern reprints reproduce the heinemann text based on wells personal experiences and childhood the working class literally spent lot of their time_traveller underground
his own family would spend most of their time_traveller in dark basement kitchen when not being occupied in their father shop
where the staff and servants lived in underground quarters medical journal published in would focus on these living quarters for servants in poorly ventilated dark basements
in his early teens wells became draper apprentice having to work in basement for hours on end this work is an early example of the dying earth subgenre
the portion of the novella that sees the time_traveller in distant future where the sun is huge and red also places the time_traveller machine within the realm of eschatology i the study of the end times the end of the world and the ultimate destiny of humankind
the time_traveller machine was reprinted in two complete science adventure books in the book protagonist is victorian english scientist and gentleman inventor living in richmond surrey and identified by narrator simply as the time_traveller
the narrator recounts the traveller lecture to his weekly dinner guests that time_traveller is simply fourth dimension and demonstrates tabletop model machine for travelling through the fourth dimension
he reveals that he has built machine capable of carrying person through time_traveller and returns at dinner the following week to recount remarkable tale becoming the new narrator
in the new narrative the time_traveller tests his device at first he thinks nothing has happened but soon finds out he went five hours into the future
he continues forward and sees his house disappear and turn into lush garden the time_traveller stops in a where he meets the eloi society of small elegant childlike adults
they live in small communities within large and futuristic yet slowly deteriorating buildings and having fruit based diet his efforts to communicate with them are hampered by their lack of curiosity or discipline
they appear happy and carefree but fear the dark and in particular fear moonless nights observing them he finds that they give no response to mysterious nocturnal disappearances
perhaps they had become traumatized and would not discuss it he speculates that they are peaceful society after exploring the area around the eloi residences the time_traveller reaches the top of hill overlooking london
he concludes that the entire planet has become garden with little trace of human society or engineering from the hundreds of thousands of years prior
returning to the site where he arrived the time_traveller is shocked to find his time_traveller machine missing and eventually concludes that it has been dragged by some unknown party into nearby structure with heavy doors locked from the inside which resembles sphinx
luckily he had removed the machine levers before leaving it the time_traveller machine being unable to travel through time_traveller without them
later in the dark he is approached menacingly by the morlocks ape like troglodytes who live in darkness underground and surface only at night
exploring one of many wells that lead to the morlocks dwellings he discovers the machinery and industry that makes the above ground paradise of the eloi possible
he alters his theory speculating that the human race has evolved into two species the leisured classes have become the ineffectual eloi and the downtrodden working classes have become the brutal light fearing morlocks
deducing that the morlocks have taken his time_traveller machine he explores the morlock tunnels learning that due to lack of any other means of sustenance they feed on the eloi
the time_traveller theorizes that intelligence is the result of and response to danger with no real challenges facing the eloi they have lost the spirit intelligence and physical fitness of humanity at its peak
meanwhile he saves an eloi named weena from drowning as none of the other eloi take any notice of her plight and they develop an innocently affectionate relationship over the course of several day
he takes weena with him on an expedition to distant structure dubbed the palace of green porcelain which turns out to be derelict museum
here the time_traveller finds fresh supply of match and fashions crude weapon against morlocks whom he must fight to get back his machine
his revised analysis is that their relationship is not one of lords and servants but of livestock and ranchers he plans to take weena back to his own time_traveller
because the long and tiring journey back to weena home is too much for them they stop in the forest for the night
the traveller escapes when small fire he had left behind them to distract the morlocks catches up to them as forest fire weena and the pursuing morlocks are lost in the fire and the time_traveller is devastated over his loss
the morlocks open the sphinx and use the time_traveller machine as bait to capture the traveller not understanding that he will use it to escape
they are then overcome by morlocks in the night whereby weena faints he reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly million years from his own time_traveller
there he sees some of the last living things on dying earth menacing reddish crab like creatures slowly wandering the blood red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in world covered in simple lichenous vegetation
he continues to make jumps forward through time_traveller seeing earth rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger redder and dimmer and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out
overwhelmed he goes back to the machine and returns to his own time_traveller arriving at the laboratory just three hours after he originally left
he arrives late to his own dinner party whereupon after eating the time_traveller relates his adventures to his disbelieving visitors producing as evidence two strange white flowers weena had put in his pocket
the original narrator then takes over and relates that he returned to the time_traveller house the next day finding him preparing for another journey and promising to return in short time_traveller
however the narrator reveals that he has waited three years before writing and stating the time_traveller has not returned from his journey
it was drafted at the suggestion of wells editor william ernest henley who wanted wells to oblige your editor by lengthening the text with among other things an illustration of the ultimate degeneracy of humanity
there was slight struggle wells later recalled between the writer and e henley who wanted he said to put little writing into the tale
but the writer was in reaction from that sort of thing the henley interpolations were cut out again and he had his own way with his text
a section from the eleventh chapter of the serial published in new review may was deleted from the book this portion of the story was published elsewhere as the grey man
the deleted text was also published by forrest ackerman in an issue of the american edition of perry rhodan the deleted text recounts an incident immediately after the traveller escape from the morlocks
he stuns or kills one with rock and upon closer examination realises they are probably the descendants of humans eloi morlocks
a gigantic centipede like arthropod approaches and the traveller flees into the next day finding that the creature has apparently eaten the tiny humanoid
he finds himself in the distant future of an unrecognisable earth populated with furry hopping herbivores resembling kangaroos the dover press and easton press editions of the novella restore this deleted segment

the statue of the sphinx is the place where the morlocks hide the time_traveller machine and references the sphinx in the story of oedipus who gives riddle that he must first solve before he can pass
the sphinx appeared on the cover of the first london edition as requested by wells and would have been familiar to his readers
the name morlock the time_traveller machine can be read as symbolic novel the white flowers can symbolize weena devotion and innocence and contrast with the machinery of the time_traveller machine
