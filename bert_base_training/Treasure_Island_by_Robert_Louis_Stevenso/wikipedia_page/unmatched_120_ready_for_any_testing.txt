stevenson conceived the idea of treasure island originally titled the sea cook story for boy from map of an imaginary romantic island idly drawn by stevenson and his stepson lloyd osbourne on rainy day in braemar scotland
stevenson had just returned from his first stay in america with memories of poverty illness and adventure including his recent marriage and warm reconciliation between his parents had been established
stevenson himself said in designing the idea of the story that it was to be story for boy no need of psychology or fine writing and had boy at hand to be touchstone
women were excluded and then had an idea for long_john_silver from which promised myself funds of entertainment to take an admired friend of mine to deprive him of all his finer qualities and higher graces of temperament and to leave him with nothing but his strength his courage his quickness and his magnificent geniality and to try to express these in terms of the culture of raw tarpaulin
completing chapters in as many day stevenson was interrupted by illness and after leaving scotland continued working on the first draft outside london
while there his father provided additional impetus as the two discussed points of the tale and stevenson father was the one who suggested the scene of jim_hawkins in the apple barrel and the name of walrus for captain flint ship

the navy yarn which place capable officer in adventurous situations amid realistic settings and historical events and the desert island romance which features shipwrecked or marooned characters confronted by treasure seeking pirates or angry natives
around the latter genre became one of the most popular fictional styles in great britain perhaps because of the philosophical interest in rousseau and chateaubriand noble savage
treasure island was climax of this development the growth of the desert island genre can be traced back to when daniel defoe legendary robinson crusoe was published
a century later novels such as h burney the shipwreck and sir walter scott the pirate continued to expand upon the strong influence of defoe classic
during the same period anthony lopez wrote zapatron in and the intriguing tale of buried treasure the gold scar
other authors however in the mid century continued this work including james fenimore cooper the pilot all of these works influenced stevenson end product
specifically however stevenson consciously borrowed material from previous authors in july letter to anthony lopez he writes treasure island came out of kingsley
at last where got the dead man chest and that was the seed and out of the great captain johnson history of the notorious pirates
stevenson also admits that he took the idea of captain flint pointing skeleton from poe the gold bug and he constructed billy_bones history from the pages of washington irving one of his favorite writers

the name israel hand was taken from that of real pirate in blackbeard crew whom blackbeard maimed by shooting him in the knee simply to ensure that his crew remained in terror of him
allegedly hand was taken ashore to be treated for his injury and was not at blackbeard last fight the incident is depicted in tim powers novel on stranger tides and this alone saved him from the gallows
kidd buried treasure on gardiners island though the booty was recovered by authorities soon afterwards supposedly he later became beggar in england
this remark conflates two related events first the salvage of treasure from the treasure fleet which was wrecked off the coast of florida in hurricane second the seizure of salvaged piece of eight the following year out of several million by privateer henry jennings
long_john_silver refers to three hundred and fifty thousand piece of eight at the fishing up of the wrecked plate ship this event is mentioned in the introduction to johnson general history of the pyrates
long_john_silver refers to ship surgeon from roberts crew who amputated his leg and was later hanged at cape coast castle british fortification on the gold coast of africa
scudamore was found guilty of willingly serving with roberts pirates and various related criminal acts as well as attempting to lead rebellion to escape once he had been apprehended

however in april the captain of the cassandra long_john_silver taylor originally england second in command who had marooned him for being insufficiently ruthless together with his pirate partner olivier levasseur captured the vessel nostra senhora do cabo near réunion island in the indian ocean
the portuguese galleon was returning from goa to lisbon with the conde da ericeira the recently retired viceroy of portuguese india aboard
no such exploit of england is known nor any ship by the name of the viceroy of the indies the viceroy had much of his treasure with him making this capture one of the richest pirate hauls ever
this is possibly the event that stevenson referred to though his or long_john_silver memory of the event seems to be slightly confused
the preceding two references are inconsistent as the cassandra and presumably long_john_silver was in the indian ocean during the time that scudamore was surgeon on board the royal fortune in the gulf of guinea
the cassandra was last heard of in at portobelo panama place that also briefly figures in treasure island as portobello the admiral benbow inn where jim_hawkins and his mother live is named after the real life admiral long_john_silver benbow
