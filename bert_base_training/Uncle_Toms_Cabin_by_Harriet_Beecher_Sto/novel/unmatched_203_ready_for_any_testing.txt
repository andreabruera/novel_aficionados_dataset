produced by judith boss an anonymous volunteer and david widger uncle tom_loker cabin or life among the lowly by harriet beecher stowe volume
late in the afternoon of a chilly day in february two gentleman were sitting alone over their wine in a well furnished dining parlor in the town of in kentucky
there were no servant present and the gentleman with chair closely approaching seemed to be discussing some subject with great earnestness
i chapter i in which the reader is introduced to a man of humanity for convenience sake we have said hitherto two gentleman
he was a short thick set man with coarse commonplace features and that swaggering air of pretension which marks a low man who is trying to elbow his way upward in the world
he was much over dressed in a gaudy vest of many colors a blue neckerchief bedropped gayly with yellow spots and arranged with a flaunting tie quite in keeping with the general air of the man
his hand large and coarse were plentifully bedecked with rings and he wore a heavy gold watch chain with a bundle of seals of portentous size and a great variety of colors attached to it which in the ardor of conversation he was in the habit of flourishing and jingling with evident satisfaction
his conversation was in free and easy defiance of murray grammar and was garnished at convenient intervals with various profane expression which not even the desire to be graphic in our account shall induce us to transcribe
one of the party however when critically examined did not seem strictly speaking to come under the species english grammar by lindley murray the most authoritative american grammarian of his day
his companion mr_shelby had the appearance of a gentleman and the arrangements of the house and the general air of the housekeeping indicated easy and even opulent circumstances
as we before stated the two were in the midst of an earnest conversation that is the way i should arrange the matter said mr_shelby
i cant make trade that way i positively cant mr_shelby said the other holding up a glass of wine between his eye and the light
tom_loker is an uncommon fellow he is certainly worth that sum anywhere steady honest capable manages my whole farm like a clock
why the fact is mr_haley you mean honest as nigger go said mr_haley helping himself to a glass of brandy
no i mean really tom_loker is a good steady sensible pious fellow he got religion at a camp meeting four year ago and i believe he really did get it
i ve trusted him since then with everything i have money house horse and let him come and go round the country and i always found him true and square in everything
some folks dont believe there is pious nigger mr_shelby said mr_haley with a candid flourish of his hand but i do
last lot i took to orleanst was as good as a meetin now really to hear that critter pray and he was quite gentle and quiet like
he fetched me a good sum too for i bought him cheap of a man that was bliged to sell out so i realized six hundred on him
i had a fellow now in this yer yes i consider religion a valeyable thing in a nigger when it the genuine article and no mistake
why last fall i let him go to cincinnati alone to do business for me and bring home five hundred dollar
well tom_loker got the real article if ever a fellow had rejoined the other tom_loker says i to him i trust you because i think you re a christian i know you wouldnt cheat
tom_loker comes back sure enough i knew he would some low fellow they say said to him tom_loker why dont you make tracks for canada
ah master trusted me and i couldnt they told me about it i am sorry to part with tom_loker i must say
you ought to let him cover the whole balance of the debt and you would mr_haley if you had any conscience
well i ve got just as much conscience as any man in business can afford to keep just a little you know to swear by ast were said the trader jocularly and then i ready to do anything in reason to blige friend but this yer you see is a leetle too hard on a fellow a leetle too hard
the trader sighed contemplatively and poured out some more brandy well then mr_haley how will you trade said mr_shelby after an uneasy interval of silence
hum none that i could well spare to tell the truth it only hard necessity makes me willing to sell at all
well havent you a boy or gal that you could throw in with tom_loker i dont like parting with any of my hand that a fact
here the door opened and a small quadroon boy between four and five year of age entered the room there was something in his appearance remarkably beautiful and engaging
his black hair fine as floss silk hung in glossy curls about his round dimpled face while a pair of large dark eye full of fire and softness looked out from beneath the rich long lashes as he peered curiously into the apartment
a gay robe of scarlet and yellow plaid carefully made and neatly fitted set off to advantage the dark and rich style of his beauty and a certain comic air of assurance blended with bashfulness showed that he had been not unused to being petted and noticed by his master
hulloa jim_crow said mr_shelby whistling and snapping a bunch of raisins towards him pick that up now
the child scampered with all his little strength after the prize while his master laughed come here jim_crow said he
the child came up and the master patted the curly head and chucked him under the chin now jim_crow show this gentleman how you can dance and sing
the boy commenced one of those wild grotesque songs common among the negroes in a rich clear voice accompanying his singing with many comic evolutions of the hand foot and whole body all in perfect time to the music
bravo said mr_haley throwing him a quarter of an orange now jim_crow walk like old uncle cudjoe when he has the rheumatism said his master
instantly the flexible limbs of the child assumed the appearance of deformity and distortion as with his back humped up and his master stick in his hand he hobbled about the room his childish face drawn into a doleful pucker and spitting from right to left in imitation of an old man
the boy drew his chubby face down to a formidable length and commenced toning a psalm tune through his nose with imperturbable gravity
both gentleman laughed uproariously now jim_crow said his master show us how old elder robbins leads the psalm
tell you what said he suddenly clapping his hand on mr_shelby shoulder fling in that chap and i ll settle the business i will
hurrah bravo what a young un said mr_haley that chap a case i ll promise come now if that aint doing the thing up about the rightest
at this moment the door was pushed gently open and a young quadroon woman apparently about twenty five entered the room there needed only a glance from the child to her to identify her as its mother
the brown of her complexion gave way on the cheek to a perceptible flush which deepened as she saw the gaze of the strange man fixed upon her in bold and undisguised admiration
her dress was of the neatest possible fit and set off to advantage her finely moulded shape a delicately formed hand and a trim foot and ankle were items of appearance that did not escape the quick eye of the trader well used to run up at a glance the points of a fine female article
there was the same rich full dark eye with its long lashes the same ripples of silky black hair well eliza_harris said her master as she stopped and looked hesitatingly at him
i was looking for harry please sir and the boy bounded toward her showing his spoils which he had gathered in the skirt of his robe
well take him away then said mr_shelby and hastily she withdrew carrying the child on her arm
by jupiter said the trader turning to him in admiration there an article now you might make your fortune on that ar gal in orleans any day
i dont want to make my fortune on her said mr_shelby dryly and seeking to turn the conversation he uncorked a bottle of fresh wine and asked his companion opinion of it
i ve seen over a thousand in my day paid down for gal not a bit handsomer capital sir first chop said the trader then turning and slapping his hand familiarly on mr_shelby shoulder
he added come how will you trade about the gal what shall i say for her what ll you take mr_haley she is not to be sold said mr_shelby
my wife would not part with her for her weight in gold ay ay woman always say such thing cause they ha nt no sort of calculation
just show em how many watches feathers and trinkets one weight in gold would buy and that alters the case i reckon
i tell you mr_haley this must not be spoken of i say no and i mean no said mr_shelby decidedly
well you ll let me have the boy though said the trader you must own i ve come down pretty handsomely for him
why i ve got a friend that going into this yer branch of the business wants to buy up handsome boy to raise for the market
what on earth can you want with the child said mr_shelby fancy articles entirely sell for waiters and so on to rich uns that can pay for handsome uns
it sets off one of yer great place a real handsome boy to open door wait and tend they fetch a good sum and this little devil is such a comical musical concern he just the article
i would rather not sell him said mr_shelby thoughtfully the fact is sir i a humane man and i hate to take the boy from his mother sir
you do la yes something of that ar natur i understand perfectly it is mighty onpleasant getting on with woman sometimes i al ays hates these yer screechin screamin time
now what if you get the girl off for a day or a week or so then the thing done quietly all over before she comes home
they are mighty onpleasant but as i manages business i generally avoids em sir your wife might get her some ear rings or a new gown or some such truck to make up with her
i afraid not lor bless ye yes these critters aint like white folks you know they gets over thing only manage right
now they say said mr_haley assuming a candid and confidential air that this kind trade is hardening to the feeling but i never found it so
i ve seen em as would pull a woman child out of her arm and set him up to sell and she screechin like mad all the time very bad policy damages the article makes em quite unfit for service sometimes
fact is i never could do thing up the way some fellers manage the business i knew a real handsome gal once in orleans as was entirely ruined by this sort handling
the fellow that was trading for her didnt want her baby and she was one of your real high sort when her blood was up
it kinder makes my blood run cold to think oft and when they carried off the child and locked her up she jest went ravin mad and died in a week
i tell you she squeezed up her child in her arm and talked and went on real awful clear waste sir of a thousand dollar just for want of management there wheret is
and the trader leaned back in his chair and folded his arm with an air of virtuous decision apparently considering himself a second wilberforce
the subject appeared to interest the gentleman deeply for while mr_shelby was thoughtfully peeling an orange mr_haley broke out afresh with becoming diffidence but as if actually driven by the force of truth to say a few word more
it dont look well now for a feller to be praisin himself but i say it jest because it the truth
i believe i reckoned to bring in about the finest droves of nigger that is brought in at least i ve been told so if i have once i reckon i have a hundred time all in good case fat and likely and i lose as few as any man in the business
and i lays it all to my management sir and humanity sir i may say is the great pillar of my management
it always best to do the humane thing sir that been my experience mr_shelby did not know what to say and so he said indeed
now i ve been laughed at for my notions sir and i ve been talked to they ant pop lar and they ant common but i stuck to em sir
i ve stuck to em and realized well on em yes sir they have paid their passage i may say and the trader laughed at his joke
there was something so piquant and original in these elucidations of humanity that mr_shelby could not help laughing in company
perhaps you laugh too dear reader but you know humanity comes out in a variety of strange form now a day and there is no end to the odd thing that humane people will say and do
mr_shelby laugh encouraged the trader to proceed it strange now but i never could beat this into people head
now there was tom_loker my old partner down in natchez he was a clever fellow tom_loker was only the very devil with nigger on principlet was you see for a better hearted feller never broke breadt was his system sir
why tom_loker i used to say when your gal takes on and cry what the use crackin on em over the head and knockin on em round
i used to talk to tom_loker it ridiculous says i and dont do no sort good why i dont see no harm in their cryin says i it natur says i and
besides tom_loker says i it jest spiles your gal they get sickly and down in the mouth and sometimes they gets ugly particular yallow gal
if natur cant blow off one way it will another do and it the devil and all gettin on em broke in
depend on it tom_loker a little humanity thrown in along goes a heap further than all your jawin and crackin and it pays better says i depend ont
but tom_loker couldnt get the hang ont and he spiled so many for me that i had to break off with him though he was a good hearted fellow and as fair a business hand as is goin
now says i why cant you kinder coax em up and speak em fair and do you find your way of managing do the business better than tom_loker said mr_shelby
you see when i any way can i takes a leetle care about the onpleasant part like selling young uns and that get the gal out of the way out of sight out of mind you know and when it clean done and cant be helped they naturally gets used to it
tant you know as if it was white folks that brought up in the way of spectin to keep their child and wife and all that
nigger you know that fetched up properly ha nt no kind of spectations of no kind so all these thing comes easier
why yes sir i may say so i afraid mine are not properly brought up then said mr_shelby
now a nigger you see what got to be hacked and tumbled round the world and sold to tom_loker and dick and the lord knows who tant no kindness to be givin on him notions and expectations and bringin on him up too well for the rough and tumble comes all the harder on him arter
now i venture to say your nigger would be quite chop fallen in a place where some of your plantation nigger would be singing and whooping like all possessed
every man you know mr_shelby naturally thinks well of his own way and i think i treat nigger just about as well as it ever worth while to treat em
pose not you kentucky folks spile your nigger you mean well by em but tant no real kindness arter all
it a happy thing to be satisfied said mr_shelby with a slight shrug and some perceptible feeling of a disagreeable nature
well said mr_haley after they had both silently picked their nuts for a season what do you say i ll think the matter over and talk with my wife said mr_shelby
meantime mr_haley if you want the matter carried on in the quiet way you speak of you best not let your business in this neighborhood be known
it will get out among my boy and it will not be a particularly quiet business getting away any of my fellow if they know it i ll promise you
i in a devil of a hurry and shall want to know as soon as possible what i may depend on said he rising and putting on his overcoat
well call up this evening between six and seven and you shall have my answer said mr_shelby and the trader bowed himself out of the apartment
i like to have been able to kick the fellow down the steps said he to himself as he saw the door fairly closed with his impudent assurance but he knows how much he has me at advantage
if anybody had ever said to me that i should sell tom_loker down south to one of those rascally trader i should have said is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing
certainly by all means mum of course but i ll tell you and now it must come for aught i see
and eliza_harris child too i know that i shall have some fuss with wife about that and for that matter about tom_loker too
so much for being in debt heigho the fellow sees his advantage and means to push it perhaps the mildest form of the system of slavery is to be seen in the state of kentucky
the general prevalence of agricultural pursuits of a quiet and gradual nature not requiring those periodic seasons of hurry and pressure that are called for in the business of more southern districts makes the task of the negro a more healthful and reasonable one while the master content with a more gradual style of acquisition has not those temptations to hardheartedness which always overcome frail human nature when the prospect of sudden and rapid gain is weighed in the balance with no heavier counterpoise than the interests of the helpless and unprotected
whoever visits some estates there and witnesses the good humored indulgence of some master and mistress and the affectionate loyalty of some slave might be tempted to dream the oft fabled poetic legend of a patriarchal institution and all that but over and above the scene there broods a portentous shadow the shadow of law
so long as the law considers all these human beings with beating heart and living affections only as so many thing belonging to a master so long as the failure or misfortune or imprudence or death of the kindest owner may cause them any day to exchange a life of kind protection and indulgence for one of hopeless misery and toil so long it is impossible to make anything beautiful or desirable in the best regulated administration of slavery
mr_shelby was a fair average kind of man good natured and kindly and disposed to easy indulgence of those around him and there had never been a lack of anything which might contribute to the physical comfort of the negroes on his estate
he had however speculated largely and quite loosely had involved himself deeply and his notes to a large amount had come into the hand of mr_haley and this small piece of information is the key to the preceding conversation
now it had so happened that in approaching the door eliza_harris had caught enough of the conversation to know that a trader was making offers to her master for somebody
she would gladly have stopped at the door to listen as she came out but her mistress just then calling she was obliged to hasten away
her heart swelled and throbbed and she involuntarily strained him so tight that the little fellow looked up into her face in astonishment
eliza_harris girl what ails you today said her mistress when eliza_harris had upset the wash pitcher knocked down the workstand and finally was abstractedly offering her mistress a long nightgown in place of the silk dress she had ordered her to bring from the wardrobe
still she thought she heard the trader make an offer for her boy could she be mistaken eliza_harris started missis
she said raising her eye then bursting into tear she sat down in a chair and began sobbing why eliza_harris child what ails you said her mistress
missis missis said eliza_harris there been a trader talking with master in the parlor i heard him well silly child suppose there has
missis do you suppose mas would sell my harry and the poor creature threw herself into a chair and sobbed convulsively
you know your master never deals with those southern trader and never means to sell any of his servant as long as they behave well
sell him no you foolish girl why you silly child who do you think would want to buy your harry do you think all the world are set on him as you are you goosie
there now put my back hair up in that pretty braid you learnt the other day and dont go listening at door any more
come cheer up and hook my dress well but missis you never would give your consent to to nonsense child to be sure i shouldnt
what do you talk so for i would as soon have one of my own child sold but really eliza_harris you are getting altogether too proud of that little fellow
reassured by her mistress confident tone eliza_harris proceeded nimbly and adroitly with her toilet laughing at her own fears as she proceeded
a man cant put his nose into the door but you think he must be coming to buy him mrs mr_shelby was a woman of high class both intellectually and morally
to that natural magnanimity and generosity of mind which one often marks as characteristic of the woman of kentucky she added high moral and religious sensibility and principle carried out with great energy and ability into practical results
her husband who made no professions to any particular religious character nevertheless reverenced and respected the consistency of hers and stood perhaps a little in awe of her opinion
certain it was that he gave her unlimited scope in all her benevolent efforts for the comfort instruction and improvement of her servant though he never took any decided part in them himself
in fact if not exactly a believer in the doctrine of the efficiency of the extra good work of saints he really seemed somehow or other to fancy that his wife had piety and benevolence enough for two to indulge a shadowy expectation of getting into heaven through her superabundance of qualities to which he made no particular pretension
the heaviest load on his mind after his conversation with the trader lay in the foreseen necessity of breaking to his wife the arrangement contemplated meeting the importunities and opposition which he knew he should have reason to encounter
mrs mr_shelby being entirely ignorant of her husband embarrassments and knowing only the general kindliness of his temper had been quite sincere in the entire incredulity with which she had met eliza_harris suspicions
in fact she dismissed the matter from her mind without a second thought and being occupied in preparations for an evening visit it passed out of her thoughts entirely
the traveller in the south must often have remarked that peculiar air of refinement that softness of voice and manner which seems in many case to be a particular gift to the quadroon and mulatto woman
these natural graces in the quadroon are often united with beauty of the most dazzling kind and in almost every case with a personal appearance prepossessing and agreeable
eliza_harris such as we have described her is not a fancy sketch but taken from remembrance as we saw her year ago in kentucky
safe under the protecting care of her mistress eliza_harris had reached maturity without those temptations which make beauty so fatal an inheritance to a slave
she had been married to a bright and talented young mulatto man who was a slave on a neighboring estate and bore the name of george_harris
this young man had been hired out by his master to work in a bagging factory where his adroitness and ingenuity caused him to be considered the first hand in the place
he had invented a machine for the cleaning of the hemp which considering the education and circumstances of the inventor displayed quite as much mechanical genius as whitney cotton gin
chapter ii the mother eliza_harris had been brought up by her mistress from girlhood as a petted and indulged favorite
a machine of this description was really the invention of a young colored man in kentucky mrs stowe note he was possessed of a handsome person and pleasing manner and was a general favorite in the factory
nevertheless as this young man was in the eye of the law not a man but a thing all these superior qualifications were subject to the control of a vulgar narrow minded tyrannical master
this same gentleman having heard of the fame of george_harris invention took a ride over to the factory to see what this intelligent chattel had been about
he was waited upon over the factory shown the machinery by george_harris who in high spirit talked so fluently held himself so erect looked so handsome and manly that his master began to feel an uneasy consciousness of inferiority
he was received with great enthusiasm by the employer who congratulated him on possessing so valuable a slave what business had his slave to be marching round the country inventing machines and holding up his head among gentleman
he soon put a stop to it he take him back and put him to hoeing and digging and see if he step about so smart
accordingly the manufacturer and all hand concerned were astounded when he suddenly demanded george_harris wages and announced his intention of taking him home
but mr george_harris remonstrated the manufacturer isnt this rather sudden what if it is isnt the man mine
we would be willing sir to increase the rate of compensation no object at all sir i dont need to hire any of my hand out unless i ve a mind to
but sir he seems peculiarly adapted to this business dare say he may be never was much adapted to anything that i set him about i ll be bound
but only think of his inventing this machine interposed one of the workmen rather unluckily yes a machine for saving work is it
he invent that i ll be bound let a nigger alone for that any time they are all labor saving machines themselves every one of em
george_harris had stood like one transfixed at hearing his doom thus suddenly pronounced by a power that he knew was irresistible
he folded his arm tightly pressed in his lips but a whole volcano of bitter feeling burned in his bosom and sent streams of fire through his veins
he breathed short and his large dark eye flashed like live coals and he might have broken out into some dangerous ebullition had not the kindly manufacturer touched him on the arm and said in a low tone give way george_harris go with him for the present
the tyrant observed the whisper and conjectured its import though he could not hear what was said and he inwardly strengthened himself in his determination to keep the power he possessed over his victim
no he shall tramp we ll try to help you yet george_harris was taken home and put to the meanest drudgery of the farm
he had been able to repress every disrespectful word but the flashing eye the gloomy and troubled brow were part of a natural language that could not be repressed indubitable signs which showed too plainly that the man could not become a thing
it was during the happy period of his employment in the factory that george_harris had seen and married his wife during that period being much trusted and favored by his employer he had free liberty to come and go at discretion
the marriage was highly approved of by mrs mr_shelby who with a little womanly complacency in match making felt pleased to unite her handsome favorite with one of her own class who seemed in every way suited to her and so they were married in her mistress great parlor and her mistress herself adorned the bride beautiful hair with orange blossoms and threw over it
the bridal veil which certainly could scarce have rested on a fairer head and there was no lack of white gloves and cake and wine of admiring guests to praise the bride beauty and her mistress indulgence and liberality
for a year or two eliza_harris saw her husband frequently and there was nothing to interrupt their happiness except the loss of two infant child to whom she was passionately attached and whom she mourned with a grief so intense as to call for gentle remonstrance from her mistress who sought with maternal anxiety to direct her naturally passionate feeling within the bounds of reason and religion
after the birth of little harry however she had gradually become tranquillized and settled and every bleeding tie and throbbing nerve once more entwined with that little life seemed to become sound and healthful and eliza_harris was a happy woman up to the time that her husband was rudely torn from his kind employer and brought under the iron sway of his legal owner
the manufacturer true to his word visited mr george_harris a week or two after george_harris had been taken away when as he hoped the heat of the occasion had passed away and tried every possible inducement to lead him to restore him to his former employment
you neednt trouble yourself to talk any longer said he doggedly i know my own business sir i did not presume to interfere with it sir
i only thought that you might think it for your interest to let your man to us on the terms proposed
i saw your winking and whispering the day i took him out of the factory but you dont come it over me that way
i understand the matter well enough it a free country sir the man mine and i do what i please with him that it
and so fell george_harris last hope nothing before him but a life of toil and drudgery rendered more bitter by every little smarting vexation and indignity which tyrannical ingenuity could devise
a very humane jurist once said the worst use you can put a man to is to hang him no there is another use that a man can be put to that is worse
the husband and father mrs mr_shelby had gone on her visit and eliza_harris stood in the verandah rather dejectedly looking after the retreating carriage when a hand was laid on her shoulder
chapter iii she turned and a bright smile lighted up her fine eye george_harris is it you how you frightened me
missis is gone to spend the afternoon so come into my little room and we ll have the time all to ourselves
saying this she drew him into a neat little apartment opening on the verandah where she generally sat at her sewing within call of her mistress
well i am so glad you come how glad i am why dont you smile and look at harry how he grows
the boy stood shyly regarding his father through his curls holding close to the skirts of his mother dress
isnt he beautiful said eliza_harris lifting his long curls and kissing him i wish he never been born said george_harris bitterly
i wish i never been born myself surprised and frightened eliza_harris sat down leaned her head on her husband shoulder and burst into tear
there now eliza_harris it too bad for me to make you feel so poor girl said he fondly it too bad how i wish you never had seen me you might have been happy
george_harris george how can you talk so what dreadful thing has happened or is going to happen i sure we ve been very happy till lately
then drawing his child on his knee he gazed intently on his glorious dark eye and passed his hand through his long curls
just like you eliza_harris and you are the handsomest woman i ever saw and the best one i ever wish to see but oh i wish i never seen you nor you me
so we have dear said george_harris george how can you yes eliza_harris it all misery misery misery
my life is bitter as wormwood the very life is burning out of me i a poor miserable forlorn drudge i shall only drag you down with me that all
what the use of our trying to do anything trying to know anything trying to be anything what the use of living
i know how you feel about losing your place in the factory and you have a hard master but pray be patient and perhaps something patient said he interrupting her havent i been patient
did i say a word when he came and took me away for no earthly reason from the place where everybody was kind to me
i wish i was dead now dear george_harris that is really wicked i paid him truly every cent of my
earnings and they all say i worked well well it is dreadful said eliza_harris but after all he is your master you know
my master and who made him my master that what i think of what right has he to me i a man as much as he is
i know more about business than he does i am a better manager than he is i can read better than he can i can write a better hand and
i ve learned it all myself and no thanks to him i ve learned it in spite of him and now what right has he to make a dray horse of me to take me from thing i can do and do better than he can and put me to work that any horse can do
he tries to do it he says he ll bring me down and humble me and he puts me to just the hardest meanest and dirtiest work on purpose
i a better man than he is george_harris george you frighten me why i never heard you talk so i afraid you ll do something dreadful
i dont wonder at your feeling at all but oh do be careful do do for my sake for harry i have been careful and i have been patient but it growing worse and worse
i thought i could do my work well and keep on quiet and have some time to read and learn out of work hour but the more he sees i can do the more he loads on
he says that though i dont say anything he sees i ve got the devil in me and he means to bring it out and one of these day it will come out in a way that he wont like or i mistaken
flesh and blood cant bear it any longer every chance he can get to insult and torment me he takes dear
it was only yesterday said george_harris as i was busy loading stones into a cart that young mas tom_loker stood there slashing his whip so near the horse that the creature was frightened
what shall we do said eliza_harris mournfully i asked him to stop as pleasant as i could he just kept right on
i held his hand and then he screamed and kicked and ran to his father and told him that i was fighting him
he came in a rage and said he teach me who was my master and he tied me to a tree and cut switches for young master and told him that he might whip me till he was tired and he did do it
if i dont make him remember it some time and the brow of the young man grew dark and his eye burned with an expression that made his young wife tremble
i begged him again and then he turned on me and began striking me who made this man my master
well said eliza_harris mournfully i always thought that i must obey my master and mistress or i couldnt be a christian
there is some sense in it in your case they have brought you up like a child fed you clothed you indulged you and taught you so that you have a good education that is some reason why they should claim you
but i have been kicked and cuffed and sworn at and at the best only let alone and what do i owe
that what i want to know he said i ve paid for all my keeping a hundred time over
i wont bear it no i wont he said clenching his hand with a fierce frown eliza_harris trembled and was silent
she had never seen her husband in this mood before and her gentle system of ethics seemed to bend like a reed in the surges of such passions
you know poor little carlo that you gave me added george_harris the creature has been about all the comfort that i ve had
he has slept with me night and followed me around day and kind looked at me as if he understood how i felt
well the other day i was just feeding him with a few old scraps i picked up by the kitchen door and mas came along and said i was feeding him up at his expense and that he couldnt afford to have every nigger keeping his dog and ordered me to tie a stone to his neck and throw him in the pond
george_harris you didnt do it do it not i but he did mas and tom_loker pelted the poor drowning creature with stones
poor thing he looked at me so mournful as if he wondered why i didnt save him i had to take a flogging because i wouldnt do it myself
i dont care mas will find out that i one that whipping wont tame my day will come yet if he dont look out
what are you going to do george_harris dont do anything wicked if you only trust in god and try to do right he ll deliver you
i ant a christian like you eliza_harris my heart full of bitterness i cant trust in god why does he let thing be so
george_harris we must have faith mistress says that when all thing go wrong to us we must believe that god is doing the very best
that easy to say for people that are sitting on their sofas and riding in their carriages but let em be where i am i guess it would come some harder
i wish i could be good but my heart burns and cant be reconciled anyhow you couldnt in my place you cant now if i tell you all i ve got to say
well lately mas has been saying that he was a fool to let me marry off the place that he hates mr_shelby and all his tribe because they are proud and hold their head up above him and that i ve got proud notions from you and he says he wont let me come here any more and that i shall take a wife and settle down on his place
at first he only scolded and grumbled these thing but yesterday he told me that i should take mina for a wife and settle down in a cabin with her or he would sell me down river
why but you were married to me by the minister as much as if you been a white man said eliza_harris simply
you dont know the whole yet what can be coming now dont you know a slave cant be married
there is no law in this country for that i cant hold you for my wife if he chooses to part us
i wish i never been born it would have been better for us both it would have been better for this poor child if he had never been born
that why i wish i never seen you why all this may happen to him yet but master is so kind
yes but who knows he may die and then he may be sold to nobody knows who what pleasure is it that he is handsome and smart and bright
i tell you eliza_harris that a sword will pierce through your soul for every good and pleasant thing your child is or has it will make him worth too much for you to keep
the word smote heavily on eliza_harris heart the vision of the trader came before her eye and as if some one had struck her a deadly blow she turned pale and gasped for breath
she looked nervously out on the verandah where the boy tired of the grave conversation had retired and where he was riding triumphantly up and down on mr_shelby walking stick
she would have spoken to tell her husband her fears but checked herself no no he has enough to bear poor fellow
she thought no i wont tell him besides it ant true missis never deceives us so eliza_harris my girl said the husband mournfully bear up now and good by for i going
to canada said he straightening himself up and when i there i ll buy you that all the hope that left us
going george_harris going where you have a kind master that wont refuse to sell you i ll buy you and the boy god helping me i will
dreadful if you should be taken i wont be taken eliza_harris i ll die first i ll be free or i ll die
you wont kill yourself no need of that they will kill me fast enough they never will get me down the river alive
george_harris for my sake do be careful dont do anything wicked dont lay hand on yourself or anybody else you are tempted too much too much but dont go you must but go carefully prudently pray god to help you
mas took it into his head to send me right by here with a note to mr symmes that life a mile past
well then eliza_harris hear my plan i believe he expected i should come here to tell you what i have
it would please him if he thought it would aggravate mr_shelby folks as he calls em i going home quite resigned you understand as if all was over
there are those that will help me and in the course of a week or so i shall be among the missing some day
i ve got some preparations made and pray for me eliza_harris perhaps the good lord will hear you pray yourself george_harris and go trusting in him then you wont do anything wicked
they stood silent then there were last word and sobs and bitter weeping such parting as those may make whose hope to meet again is as the spider web and the husband and wife were parted
well now good by said george_harris holding eliza_harris hand and gazing into her eye without moving chapter iv an evening in
the cabin of uncle tom_loker was a small log building close adjoining to the house as the negro par excellence designates his master dwelling
in front it had a neat garden patch where every summer strawberries raspberries and a variety of fruits and vegetables flourished under careful tending
the whole front of it was covered by a large scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose which entwisting and interlacing left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to be seen
here also in summer various brilliant annuals such as marigolds petunias four clocks found an indulgent corner in which to unfold their splendors and were the delight and pride of aunt_chloe heart
the evening meal at the house is over and aunt_chloe who presided over its preparation as head cook has left to inferior officers in the kitchen the business of clearing away and washing dishes and come out into her own snug territories to get her ole man supper therefore doubt not that it is her you see by the fire presiding with anxious interest over certain frizzling items in a stew pan and anon with grave consideration lifting the cover of a bake kettle from whence steam forth indubitable intimations of something good
a round black shining face is hers so glossy as to suggest the idea that she might have been washed over with white of eggs like one of her own tea rusks
her whole plump countenance beams with satisfaction and contentment from under her well starched checked turban bearing on it however if we must confess it a little of that tinge of self consciousness which becomes the first cook of the neighborhood as aunt_chloe was universally held and acknowledged to be
uncle tom_loker cabin let us enter the dwelling a cook she certainly was in the very bone and centre of her soul
not a chicken or turkey or duck in the barn yard but looked grave when they saw her approaching and seemed evidently to be reflecting on their latter end and certain it was that she was always meditating on trussing stuffing and roasting to a degree that was calculated to inspire terror in any reflecting fowl living
her corn cake in all its varieties of hoe cake dodgers muffins and other species too numerous to mention was a sublime mystery to all less practised compounders and she would shake her fat side with honest pride and merriment as she would narrate the fruitless efforts that one and another of her compeers had made to attain to her elevation
the arrival of company at the house the arranging of dinners and suppers in style awoke all the energies of her soul and no sight was more welcome to her than a pile of travelling trunks launched on the verandah for
just at present however aunt_chloe is looking into the bake pan in which congenial operation we shall leave her till we finish our picture of the cottage
in one corner of it stood a bed covered neatly with a snowy spread and by the side of it was a piece of carpeting of some considerable size
on this piece of carpeting aunt_chloe took her stand as being decidedly in the upper walks of life and it and the bed by which it lay and the whole corner in fact were treated with distinguished consideration and made so far as possible sacred from the marauding inroads and desecrations of little folks
then she foresaw fresh efforts and fresh triumphs in fact that corner was the drawing room of the establishment in the other corner was a bed of much humbler pretensions and evidently designed for use
the wall over the fireplace was adorned with some very brilliant scriptural prints and a portrait of general washington drawn and colored in a manner which would certainly have astonished that hero if ever he happened to meet with its like
on a rough bench in the corner a couple of woolly headed boy with glistening black eye and fat shining cheeks were busy in superintending the first walking operations of the baby which as is usually the case consisted in getting up on its foot balancing a moment and then tumbling down each successive failure being violently cheered as something decidedly clever
a table somewhat rheumatic in its limbs was drawn out in front of the fire and covered with a cloth displaying cups and saucers of a decidedly brilliant pattern with other symptoms of an approaching meal
at this table was seated uncle tom_loker mr_shelby best hand who as he is to be the hero of our story we must daguerreotype for our readers
he was a large broad chested powerfully made man of a full glossy black and a face whose truly african features were characterized by an expression of grave and steady good sense united with much kindliness and benevolence
he was very busily intent at this moment on a slate lying before him on which he was carefully and slowly endeavoring to accomplish a copy of some letter in which operation he was overlooked by young mas george_harris a smart bright boy of thirteen who appeared fully to realize the dignity of his position as instructor
there was something about his whole air self respecting and dignified yet united with a confiding and humble simplicity not that way uncle tom_loker not that way
said he briskly as uncle tom_loker laboriously brought up the tail of his the wrong side out that makes a you see
la sakes now does it said uncle tom_loker looking with a respectful admiring air as his young teacher flourishingly scrawled s and s innumerable for his edification and then taking the pencil in his big heavy fingers he patiently recommenced
how easy white folks al us does thing said aunt_chloe pausing while she was greasing a griddle with a scrap of bacon on her fork and regarding young master george_harris with pride
the way he can write now and read too and then to come out here evening and read his lessons to us it mighty interestin
but aunt_chloe i getting mighty hungry said george_harris isnt that cake in the skillet almost done mose done mas george_harris said aunt_chloe lifting the lid and peeping in browning beautiful a real lovely brown
ah let me alone for dat missis let sally try to make some caket other day jes to larn her she said
o go way missis said i it really hurts my feelin now to see good vittles spilt dat ar way cake ris all to one side no shape at all no more than my shoe go way
and with this final expression of contempt for sally greenness aunt_chloe whipped the cover off the bake kettle and disclosed to view a neatly baked pound cake of which no city confectioner need to have been ashamed
this being evidently the central point of the entertainment aunt_chloe began now to bustle about earnestly in the supper department
here you mose and pete get out de way you nigger get away polly honey mammy ll give her baby some fin by and by
now mas george_harris you jest take off dem book and set down now with my old man and i ll take up de sausages and have de first griddle full of cakes on your plates in less dan no time
they wanted me to come to supper in the house said george_harris but i knew what was what too well for that aunt_chloe
so you did so you did honey said aunt_chloe heaping the smoking batter cakes on his plate you know your old aunty keep the best for you
and with that aunty gave george_harris a nudge with her finger designed to be immensely facetious and turned again to her griddle with great briskness
now for the cake said mas george_harris when the activity of the griddle department had somewhat subsided and with that the youngster flourished a large knife over the article in question
o let you alone for dat go way la bless you mas george_harris said aunt_chloe with earnestness catching his arm you wouldnt be for cuttin it wid
dat ar great heavy knife smash all down spile all de pretty rise of it here i ve got a thin old knife i keeps sharp a purpose
dar now see comes apart light as a feather now eat away you wont get anything to beat dat ar tom_loker lincon says said george_harris speaking with his mouth full that their jinny is a better cook than you
they spectable folks enough in a kinder plain way but as to gettin up anything in style they dont begin to have a notion on
dem lincons ant much count no way said aunt_chloe contemptuously i mean set along side our folkst set
mas lincon now alongside mas mr_shelby good lor and missis lincon can she kinder sweep it into a room like my missis so kinder splendid yer know
o go way dont tell me nothing of dem lincons and aunt_chloe tossed her head as one who hoped she did know something of the world
well though i ve heard you say said george_harris that jinny was a pretty fair cook so i did said aunt_chloe i may say dat
good plain common cookin jinny ll do make a good pone bread bile her taters far her corn cakes isnt extra not extra now jinny corn cakes isnt but then they far but
lor come to de higher branches and what can she do why she makes pies sartin she does but what kinder crust

can she make your real flecky paste as melts in your mouth and lies all up like a puff jinny and i is good friend ye know
i never said nothing but go long mas george_harris why i shouldnt sleep a wink for a week if i had a batch of pies like dem ar
why dey want no countt all i suppose jinny thought they were ever so nice said george_harris thought so didn t
she thar she was showing em as innocent ye see it jest here jinny dont know lor the family ant nothing
she cant be spected to know ta nt no fault hem ah mas george_harris you doesnt know half your privileges in yer family and bringin up
here aunt_chloe sighed and rolled up her eye with emotion i sure aunt_chloe i understand my pie and pudding privileges said george_harris
aunt_chloe sat back in her chair and indulged in a hearty guffaw of laughter at this witticism of young mas s laughing till the tear rolled down her black shining cheeks and varying the exercise with playfully slapping and poking mas georgey and telling him to go way and that he was a case that he was fit to kill her and that he sartin would kill her one of these day and between each of these sanguinary predictions going off into a laugh each longer and stronger than the other till george_harris really began to think that he was a very dangerously witty fellow and that it became him to be careful how he talked as funny as he could
ask tom_loker lincon if i dont crow over him every time i meet him and so ye telled tom_loker did ye
o lor what young uns will be up ter ye crowed over tom_loker lor mas george_harris if ye wouldnt make a hornbug laugh
yes said george_harris i says to him tom_loker you ought to see some of aunt_chloe pies they re the right sort says i
pity now tom_loker couldnt said aunt_chloe on whose benevolent heart the idea of tom_loker benighted condition seemed to make a strong impression
ye oughter just ask him here to dinner some these time mas george_harris she added it would look quite pretty of ye
mas george_harris ye oughtenter feel bove nobody on count yer privileges cause all our privileges is gi to us we ought al ays to member that said aunt_chloe looking quite serious
well i mean to ask tom_loker here some day next week said george_harris and you do your prettiest aunt_chloe and we ll make him stare
ye know wont we make him eat so he wont get over it for a fortnight yes yes sartin said aunt_chloe delighted you ll see
lor to think of some of our dinners yer mind dat ar great chicken pie i made when we guv de dinner to general knox
i and missis we come pretty near quarrelling about dat ar crust what does get into lady sometimes i dont know
but sometimes when a body has de heaviest kind sponsibility on em as ye may say and is all kinder seris and taken up dey takes dat
now missis she wanted me to do dis way and she wanted me to do dat way and finally i got kinder sarcy and says i now missis do jist look at dem beautiful white hand yourn with long fingers and all a sparkling with rings like my white lilies when de dew on em and look at my great black stumpin hand
now dont ye think dat de lord must have meant me to make de pie crust and you to stay in de parlor
ar time to be hangin round and kinder interferin dar i was jist so sarcy mas george_harris and what did mother say said george_harris
say why she kinder larfed in her eye dem great handsome eye hern and says she well aunt_chloe i think you are about in the right ont says she and she went off in de parlor
she oughter cracked me over de head for bein so sarcy but dar whart is i cant do nothing with lady in de kitchen
well you made out well with that dinner i remember everybody said so said george_harris didnt i and want i behind de dinin room door dat bery day
and didnt i see de general pass his plate three time for some more dat bery pie and says he you must have an uncommon cook mrs mr_shelby
lor i was fit to split myself and de gineral he knows what cookin is said aunt_chloe drawing herself up with an air
bery nice man de gineral he comes of one of de bery fustest family in old virginny he knows what what now as well as i do de gineral
ye see there pints in all pies mas george_harris but tant everybody knows what they is or as orter be but the gineral he knows i knew by his marks he made
by this time master george_harris had arrived at that pass to which even a boy can come under uncommon circumstances when he really could not eat another morsel and therefore he was at leisure to notice the pile of woolly head and glistening eye which were regarding their operations hungrily from the opposite corner
yes he knows what de pints is here you mose pete he said breaking off liberal bits and throwing it at them you want some dont you
and george_harris and tom_loker moved to a comfortable seat in the chimney corner while aunte aunt_chloe after baking a goodly pile of cakes took her baby on her lap and began alternately filling its mouth and her own and distributing to mose and pete who seemed rather to prefer eating theirs as they rolled about on the floor under the table tickling each other and occasionally pulling the baby toes
o go long will ye said the mother giving now and then a kick in a kind of general way under the table when the movement became too obstreperous
come aunt_chloe bake them some cakes cant ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye
stop dat ar now will ye better mind yerselves or i ll take ye down a button hole lower when mas george_harris is gone
what meaning was couched under this terrible threat it is difficult to say but certain it is that its awful indistinctness seemed to produce very little impression on the young sinners addressed
la now said uncle tom_loker they are so full of tickle all the while they cant behave theirselves
here the boy emerged from under the table and with hand and face well plastered with molasses began a vigorous kissing of the baby
get along wid ye said the mother pushing away their woolly head ye ll all stick together and never get clar if ye do dat fashion
she said seconding her exhortations by a slap which resounded very formidably but which seemed only to knock out so much more laugh from the young one as they tumbled precipitately over each other out of door where they fairly screamed with merriment
did ye ever see such aggravating young uns said aunt_chloe rather complacently as producing an old towel kept for such emergencies she poured a little water out of the cracked tea pot on it and began rubbing off the molasses from the baby face and hand and having polished her till she shone she set her down in tom_loker lap while she busied herself in clearing away supper
the baby employed the intervals in pulling tom_loker nose scratching his face and burying her fat hand in his woolly hair which last operation seemed to afford her special content
aint she a peart young un said tom_loker holding her from him to take a full length view then getting up he set her on his broad shoulder and began capering and dancing with her while mas george_harris snapped at her with his pocket handkerchief and mose and pete now returned again roared after her like bears till aunt_chloe declared that they fairly took her head off with their noise
as according to her own statement this surgical operation was a matter of daily occurrence in the cabin the declaration no whit abated the merriment till every one had roared and tumbled and danced themselves down to a state of composure
well now i hopes you re done said aunt_chloe who had been busy in pulling out a rude box of a trundle bed and now you mose and you pete get into thar for we goin to have the meetin
go long to de spring and wash yerselves mother we dont wanter we wants to sit up to meetin meetin is so curis
la aunt_chloe shove it under and let em sit up said mas george_harris decisively giving a push to the rude machine
aunt_chloe having thus saved appearances seemed highly delighted to push the thing under saying as she did so well mebbet will do em some good
we likes em the house now resolved itself into a committee of the whole to consider the accommodations and arrangements for the meeting
as the meeting had been held at uncle tom_loker weekly for an indefinite length of time without any more cheers there seemed some encouragement to hope that a way would be discovered at present
what we to do for cheers now i declar i dont know said aunt_chloe old uncle peter sung both de legs out of dat oldest cheer last week suggested mose
you go long i ll boun you pulled em out some your shines said aunt_chloe well it ll stand if it only keeps jam up agin de wall said mose
den uncle peter mus nt sit in it cause he al ays hitches when he gets a singing he hitched pretty nigh across de roomt other night said pete
good lor get him in it then said mose and den he begin come saints and sinners hear me tell and den down he d
go and mose imitated precisely the nasal tone of the old man tumbling on the floor to illustrate the supposed catastrophe
come now be decent cant ye said aunt_chloe ant yer shamed mas george_harris however joined the offender in the laugh and declared decidedly that mose was a buster
so the maternal admonition seemed rather to fail of effect well ole man said aunt_chloe you ll have to tote in them ar bar ls
mother bar ls is like dat ar widder mas george_harris was reading bout in de good book dey never fails said mose aside to peter
i sure one on em caved in last week said pete and let em all down in de middle of de singin dat ar was failin warnt it
during this aside between mose and pete two empty casks had been rolled into the cabin and being secured from rolling by stones on each side boards were laid across them which arrangement together with the turning down of certain tubs and pails and the disposing of the rickety chair at last completed the preparation
george_harris is such a beautiful reader now i know he ll stay to read for us said aunt_chloe pears liket will be so much more interestin
mas george_harris very readily consented for your boy is always ready for anything that makes him of importance
the room was soon filled with a motley assemblage from the old gray headed patriarch of eighty to the young girl and lad of fifteen
a little harmless gossip ensued on various themes such as where old aunt sally got her new red headkerchief and how missis was a going to give lizzy that spotted muslin gown when she got her new berage made up and how mas mr_shelby was thinking of buying a new sorrel colt that was going to prove an addition to the glories of the place
a few of the worshippers belonged to family hard by who had got permission to attend and who brought in various choice scraps of information about the sayings and doings at the house and on the place which circulated as freely as the same sort of small change does in higher circles
not even all the disadvantage of nasal intonation could prevent the effect of the naturally fine voice in air at once wild and spirited
the word were sometimes the well known and common hymns sung in the churches about and sometimes of a wilder more indefinite character picked up at camp meetings
after a while the singing commenced to the evident delight of all present the chorus of one of them which ran as follows was sung with great energy and unction
die on the field of battle die on the field of battle glory in my soul another special favorite had oft repeated the word
i going to glory wont you come along with me dont you see the angels beck ning and a calling me away
there were others which made incessant mention of jordan banks and canaan fields and the new jerusalem for the negro mind impassioned and imaginative always attaches itself to hymns and expression of a vivid and pictorial nature and as they sung some laughed and some cried and some clapped hand or shook hand rejoicingly with each other as if they had fairly gained the other side of the river
dont you see the golden city and the everlasting day various exhortations or relations of experience followed and intermingled with the singing
one old gray headed woman long past work but much revered as a sort of chronicle of the past rose and leaning on her staff said well
well i mighty glad to hear ye all and see ye all once more cause i dont know when i ll be gone to glory but i ve done got ready chil en pears like i got my little bundle all tied up and my bonnet on jest a waitin for the stage to come along and take me home sometimes in the night i think i hear the wheels a rattlin and i lookin out all the time now you jest be ready too for i tell ye all chil en she said striking her staff hard on the floor dat ar glory is a mighty thing
and the old creature sat down with streaming tear as wholly overcome while the whole circle struck up canaan bright canaan i bound for the land of canaan
chil en it a mighty thing chil en you don no nothing about it it wonderful mas george_harris by request read the last chapters of revelation often interrupted by such exclamations as the sakes now
george_harris who was a bright boy and well trained in religious thing by his mother finding himself an object of general admiration threw in expositions of his own from time to time with a commendable seriousness and gravity for which he was admired by the young and blessed by the old and it was agreed on all hand that a minister couldnt lay it off better than he did thatt was reely mazin
only hear that jest think ont is all that a comin sure enough uncle tom_loker was a sort of patriarch in religious matter in the neighborhood
having naturally an organization in which the morale was strongly predominant together with a greater breadth and cultivation of mind than obtained among his companions he was looked up to with great respect as a sort of minister among them and the simple hearty sincere style of his exhortations might have edified even better educated persons
nothing could exceed the touching simplicity the childlike earnestness of his prayer enriched with the language of scripture which seemed so entirely to have wrought itself into his being as to have become a part of himself and to drop from his lips unconsciously in the language of a pious old negro he prayed right up
and so much did his prayer always work on the devotional feeling of his audiences that there seemed often a danger that it would be lost altogether in the abundance of the responses which broke out everywhere around him
while this scene was passing in the cabin of the man one quite otherwise passed in the halls of the master
the trader and mr_shelby were seated together in the dining room afore named at a table covered with paper and writing utensils
mr_shelby was busy in counting some bundles of bills which as they were counted he pushed over to the trader who counted them likewise
but it was in prayer that he especially excelled all fair said the trader and now for signing these yer
mr_shelby hastily drew the bills of sale towards him and signed them like a man that hurries over some disagreeable business and then pushed them over with the money
mr_haley produced from a well worn valise a parchment which after looking over it a moment he handed to mr_shelby who took it with a gesture of suppressed eagerness
wal now the thing done said the trader getting up it done said mr_shelby in a musing tone and fetching a long breath he repeated it done
mr_haley said mr_shelby i hope you ll remember that you promised on your honor you wouldnt sell tom_loker without knowing what sort of hand he going into
yer dont seem to feel much pleased with it pears to me said the trader why you ve just done it sir said the trader
circumstances you well know obliged me said mr_shelby haughtily wal you know they may blige me too said the trader
howsomever i ll do the very best i can in gettin tom_loker a good berth as to my treatin on him bad you neednt be a grain afeard
after the expositions which the trader had previously given of his humane principles mr_shelby did not feel particularly reassured by these declarations but as they were the best comfort the case admitted of he allowed the trader to depart in silence and betook himself to a solitary cigar
if there anything that i thank the lord for it is that i never noways cruel chapter showing the feeling of living property on changing
he was lounging in a large easy chair looking over some letter that had come in the afternoon mail and she was standing before her mirror brushing out the complicated braids and curls in which eliza_harris had arranged her hair for noticing her pale cheeks and haggard eye she had excused her attendance that night and ordered her to bed
the employment naturally enough suggested her conversation with the girl in the morning and turning to her husband she said carelessly by the by arthur who was that low bred fellow that you lugged in to our dinner table today
mr_haley is his name said mr_shelby turning himself rather uneasily in his chair and continuing with his eye fixed on a letter
owners mr and mrs mr_shelby had retired to their apartment for the night mr_haley who is he and what may be his business here pray
well he a man that i transacted some business with last time i was at natchez said mr_shelby
and he presumed on it to make himself quite at home and call and dine here ay why i invited him i had some accounts with him said mr_shelby
is he a negro trader said mrs mr_shelby noticing a certain embarrassment in her husband manner why my dear what put that into your head said mr_shelby looking up
eliza_harris came in here after dinner in a great worry crying and taking on and said you were talking with a trader and that she heard him make an offer for her boy the ridiculous little goose
she did hey said mr_shelby returning to his paper which he seemed for a few moment quite intent upon not perceiving that he was holding it bottom upwards
i told eliza_harris said mrs mr_shelby as she continued brushing her hair that she was a little fool for her pains and that you never had anything to do with that sort of persons
nothing only it will have to come out said he mentally as well now as ever of course i knew you never meant to sell any of our people least of all to such a fellow
well emily said her husband so i have always felt and said but the fact is that my business lies so that i cannot get on without
i shall have to sell some of my hand to that creature impossible mr_shelby you cannot be serious
i sorry to say that i am said mr_shelby i ve agreed to sell tom_loker what our tom_loker that good faithful creature been your faithful servant from a boy
o mr_shelby and you have promised him his freedom too you and i have spoken to him a hundred time of it
well i can believe anything now i can believe now that you could sell little harry poor eliza_harris only child said mrs mr_shelby in a tone between grief and indignation
i have agreed to sell tom_loker and harry both and i dont know why i am to be rated as if i were a monster for doing what every one does every day
well since you must know all it is so but why of all others choose these said mrs mr_shelby
why sell them of all on the place if you must sell at all because they will bring the highest sum of any that why
i could choose another if you say so the fellow made me a high bid on eliza_harris if that would suit you any better said mr_shelby
the wretch said mrs mr_shelby vehemently well i didnt listen to it a moment out of regard to your feeling
i wouldnt so give me some credit my dear said mrs mr_shelby recollecting herself forgive me i have been hasty i was surprised and entirely unprepared for
this but surely you will allow me to intercede for these poor creature tom_loker is a noble hearted faithful fellow if he is black
i do believe mr_shelby that if he were put to it he would lay down his life for you i know it i dare
say but what the use of all this i cant help myself why not make a pecuniary sacrifice i willing to bear my part of the inconvenience
o mr_shelby i have tried tried most faithfully as a christian woman should to do my duty to these poor simple dependent creature
i have cared for them instructed them watched over them and know all their little care and joys for year and how can i ever hold up my head again among them if for the sake of a little paltry gain we sell such a faithful excellent confiding creature as poor tom_loker and tear from him in a moment all we have taught him to love and value
i have taught them the duties of the family of parent and child and husband and wife and how can i bear to have this open acknowledgment that we care for no tie no duty
i have talked with eliza_harris about her boy her duty to him as a christian mother to watch over him pray for him and bring him up in a christian way and now what can i say if you tear him away and sell him soul and body to a profane unprincipled man just to save a little money
i have told her that one soul is worth more than all the money in the world and how will she believe me when she sees us turn round and sell her child sell him perhaps to certain ruin of body and soul
i am said mr_shelby and i respect your feeling too though i dont pretend to share them to their full extent but i tell you now solemnly it of no use i cant help myself
i didnt mean to tell you this emily but in plain word there is no choice between selling these two and selling everything
no relation however sacred compared with money i sorry you feel so about it indeed either they must go or all must
mr_haley has come into possession of a mortgage which if i dont clear off with him directly will take everything before it
i ve raked and scraped and borrowed and all but begged and the price of these two was needed to make up the balance and i had to give them up
mr_haley fancied the child he agreed to settle the matter that way and no other i was in his power and had to do it
if you feel so to have them sold would it be any better to have all sold mrs mr_shelby stood like one stricken
this is god curse on slavery a bitter bitter most accursed thing a curse to the master and a curse to the slave
finally turning to her toilet she rested her face in her hand and gave a sort of groan i was a fool to think i could make anything good out of such a deadly evil
always thought so when i was a girl i thought so still more after i joined the church but i thought i could gild it over i thought by kindness and care and instruction i could make the condition of mine better than freedom
it is a sin to hold a slave under law like ours i always felt it was i fool that i was why wife you are getting to be an abolitionist quite
we dont need them to tell us you know i never thought that slavery was right never felt willing to own slave
abolitionist if they knew all i know about slavery they might talk well therein you differ from many wise and pious man said mr_shelby
you remember mr s sermon the other sunday i dont want to hear such sermons i never wish to hear mr in our church again
ministers cant help the evil perhaps cant cure it any more than we can but defend it it always went against my common sense
well said mr_shelby i must say these ministers sometimes carry matter further than we poor sinners would exactly dare to do
we man of the world must wink pretty hard at various thing and get used to a deal that isnt the exact thing
but we dont quite fancy when woman and ministers come out broad and square and go beyond us in matter of either modesty or morals that a fact
but now my dear i trust you see the necessity of the thing and you see that i have done the very best that circumstances would allow
o yes yes said mrs mr_shelby hurriedly and abstractedly fingering her gold watch i havent any jewelry of any amount she added thoughtfully
and i think you didnt think much of that sermon either but would not this watch do something it was an expensive one when it was bought
i sorry very sorry emily said mr_shelby i sorry this takes hold of you so but it will do no good
the fact is emily the thing done the bills of sale are already signed and in mr_haley hand and you must be thankful it is no worse
if i could only at least save eliza_harris child i would sacrifice anything i have that man has had it in his power to ruin us
all and now he is fairly off if you knew the man as i do you think that we had had a narrow escape
why not a cruel man exactly but a man of leather a man alive to nothing but trade and profit cool and unhesitating and unrelenting as death and the grave
is he so hard then he sell his own mother at a good percentage not wishing the old woman any harm either
well my dear the fact is that this goes rather hard with me it a thing i hate to think of
and this wretch owns that good faithful tom_loker and eliza_harris child mr_haley wants to drive matter and take possession tomorrow
i going to get out my horse bright and early and be off i cant see tom_loker that a fact and you had better arrange a drive somewhere and carry eliza_harris off
let the thing be done when she is out of sight no no said mrs mr_shelby i ll be in no sense accomplice or help in this cruel business
i ll go and see poor old tom_loker god help him in his distress they shall see at any rate that their mistress can feel for and with them
as to eliza_harris i dare not think about it the lord forgive us what have we done that this cruel necessity should come on us
there was one listener to this conversation whom mr and mrs mr_shelby little suspected communicating with their apartment was a large closet opening by a door into the outer passage
when mrs mr_shelby had dismissed eliza_harris for the night her feverish and excited mind had suggested the idea of this closet and she had hidden herself there and with her ear pressed close against the crack of the door had lost not a word of the conversation
pale shivering with rigid features and compressed lips she looked an entirely altered being from the soft and timid creature she had been hitherto
she moved cautiously along the entry paused one moment at her mistress door and raised her hand in mute appeal to heaven and then turned and glided into her own room
when the voice died into silence she rose and crept stealthily away it was a quiet neat apartment on the same floor with her mistress
there was a pleasant sunny window where she had often sat singing at her sewing there a little case of book and various little fancy articles ranged by them the gifts of christmas holidays there was her simple wardrobe in the closet and in the drawers here was in short her home and on the whole a happy one it had been to her
but there on the bed lay her slumbering boy his long curls falling negligently around his unconscious face his rosy mouth half open his little fat hand thrown out over the bedclothes and a smile spread like a sunbeam over his whole face
no tear dropped over that pillow in such straits as these the heart has no tear to give it drops only blood bleeding itself away in silence
poor boy poor fellow said eliza_harris they have sold you but your mother will save you yet she took a piece of paper and a pencil and wrote hastily missis
dear missis dont think me ungrateful dont think hard of me any way i heard all you and master said tonight i am going to try to save my boy you will not blame me
hastily folding and directing this she went to a drawer and made up a little package of clothing for her boy which she tied with a handkerchief firmly round her waist and so fond is a mother remembrance that even in the terrors of that hour she did not forget to put in the little package one or two of his favorite toys reserving a gayly painted parrot to amuse him when she should be called on to awaken him
it was some trouble to arouse the little sleeper but after some effort he sat up and was playing with his mrs_bird while his mother was putting on her bonnet and shawl
god bless and reward you for all your kindness where are you going mother said he as she drew near the bed with his little coat and cap
his mother drew near and looked so earnestly into his eye that he at once divined that something unusual was the matter
a wicked man was coming to take little harry away from his mother and carry him way off in the dark but mother wont let him
she going to put on her little boy cap and coat and run off with him so the ugly man cant catch him
saying these word she had tied and buttoned on the child simple outfit and taking him in her arm she whispered to him to be very still and opening a door in her room which led into the outer verandah she glided noiselessly out
it was a sparkling frosty starlight night and the mother wrapped the shawl close round her child as perfectly quiet with vague terror he clung round her neck
old bruno a great newfoundland who slept at the end of the porch rose with a low growl as she came near
she gently spoke his name and the animal an old pet and playmate of hers instantly wagging his tail prepared to follow her though apparently revolving much in this simple dog head what such an indiscreet midnight promenade might mean
some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed to embarrass him considerably for he often stopped as eliza_harris glided forward and looked wistfully first at her and then at the house and then as if reassured by reflection he pattered along after her again
hush harry she said mustnt speak loud or they will hear us a few minutes brought them to the window of uncle tom_loker cottage and eliza_harris stopping tapped lightly on the window pane
the prayer meeting at uncle tom_loker had in the order of hymn singing been protracted to a very late hour and as uncle tom_loker had indulged himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards the consequence was that although it was now between twelve and one clock he and his worthy helpmeet were not yet asleep
good lord what that said aunt_chloe starting up and hastily drawing the curtain my sakes alive if it ant lizy
get on your clothes old man quick there old bruno too a pawin round what on airth i gwine to open the door
and suiting the action to the word the door flew open and the light of the tallow candle which tom_loker had hastily lighted fell on the haggard face and dark wild eye of the fugitive
lord bless you i skeered to look at ye lizy are ye tuck sick or what come over ye i running away uncle tom_loker and aunt_chloe carrying off my child master sold him
yes sold him said eliza_harris firmly i crept into the closet by mistress door tonight and i heard master tell missis that he had sold my harry and you uncle tom_loker both to a trader and that he was going off this morning on his horse and that the man was to take possession today
sold him echoed both lifting up their hand in dismay tom_loker had stood during this speech with his hand raised and his eye dilated like a man in a dream
slowly and gradually as its meaning came over him he collapsed rather than seated himself on his old chair and sunk his head down upon his knees
the good lord have pity on us said aunt_chloe it dont seem as if it was true
what has he done that mas should sell him he hasnt done anything it isnt for that master dont want to sell and missis
i heard her plead and beg for us but he told hert was no use that he was in this man debt and that this man had got the power over him and that if he didnt pay him off clear it would end in his having to sell the place and all the people and move off
yes i heard him say there was no choice between selling these two and selling all the man was driving him so hard
she always good master said he was sorry but oh missis you ought to have heard her talk if she ant a christian and an angel there never was one
she said herself one soul was worth more than the world and this boy has a soul and if i let him be carried off who knows what ll become of it
i a wicked girl to leave her so but then i cant help it it must be right but if it ant right the lord forgive me for i cant help doing it
well old man said aunt_chloe why dont you go too will you wait to be toted down river where they kill nigger with hard work and starving
i a heap rather die than go there any day there time for ye be off with lizy you ve got a pass to come and go any time
come bustle up and i ll get your thing together tom_loker slowly raised his head and looked sorrowfully but quietly around and said no no i ant going
let eliza_harris go it her right i wouldnt be the one to say no tant in natur for her to stay but you heard what she said
if i must be sold or all the people on the place and everything go to rack why let me be sold
i pose i can bar it as well as any on em he added while something like a sob and a sigh shook his broad rough chest convulsively
mas always found me on the spot he always will i never have broke trust nor used my pass no way contrary to my word and i never will
it better for me alone to go than to break up the place and sell all mas ant to blame aunt_chloe and he ll take care of you and the poor
here he turned to the rough trundle bed full of little woolly head and broke fairly down he leaned over the back of the chair and covered his face with his large hand
sobs heavy hoarse and loud shook the chair and great tear fell through his fingers on the floor just such tear sir as you dropped into the coffin where lay your first born son such tear woman as you shed when you heard the cries of your dying babe
and woman though dressed in silk and jewels you are but a woman and in life great straits and mighty griefs ye feel but one sorrow
and now said eliza_harris as she stood in the door i saw my husband only this afternoon and i little knew then what was to come
they have pushed him to the very last standing place and he told me today that he was going to run away
for sir he was a man and you are but another man do try if you can to get word to him
you must give my love to him and tell him if i never see him again she turned away and stood with her back to them for a moment and then added in a husky voice tell him to be as good as he can and try and meet me in the kingdom of heaven
tell him how i went and why i went and tell him i going to try and find canada call bruno in there she added
a few last word and tear a few simple adieus and blessings and clasping her wondering and affrighted child in her arm she glided noiselessly away
chapter vi discovery mr and mrs mr_shelby after their protracted discussion of the night before did not readily sink to repose and in consequence slept somewhat later than usual the ensuing morning
shut the door on him poor beast he mustnt go with me i wonder what keeps eliza_harris said mrs mr_shelby after giving her bell repeated pulls to no purpose
mr_shelby was standing before his dressing glass sharpening his razor and just then the door opened and a colored boy entered with his shaving water
andy said his mistress step to eliza_harris door and tell her i have rung for her three time poor thing
lizy drawers is all open and her thing all lying every which way and i believe she just done clared out
she added to herself with a sigh andy soon returned with eye very wide in astonishment lor missis the truth flashed upon mr_shelby and his wife at the same moment
he exclaimed then she suspected it and she off the lord be thanked said mrs mr_shelby i trust she is
mr_haley saw that i hesitated about selling this child and he ll think i connived at it to get him out of the way
wife you talk like a fool really it will be something pretty awkward for me if she is it touches my honor
there was great running and ejaculating and opening and shutting of door and appearance of face in all shades of color in different place for about a quarter of an hour
one person only who might have shed some light on the matter was entirely silent and that was the head cook aunt_chloe
silently and with a heavy cloud settled down over her once joyous face she proceeded making out her breakfast biscuits as if she heard and saw nothing of the excitement around her
very soon about a dozen young imps were roosting like so many crows on the verandah railings each one determined to be the first one to apprize the strange mas of his ill luck
and mr_shelby left the room hastily he ll be rael mad i ll be bound said andy wont he swar said little black jake
i hearn all about it then cause i got into the closet where missis keeps the great jugs and i hearn every word
and mandy who had never in her life thought of the meaning of a word she had heard more than a black cat now took air of superior wisdom and strutted about forgetting to state that though actually coiled up among the jugs at the time specified she had been fast asleep all the time
yes for he does swar said woolly headed mandy i hearn him yesterday at dinner when at last mr_haley appeared booted and spurred he was saluted with the bad tidings on every hand
the young imps on the verandah were not disappointed in their hope of hearing him swar which he did with a fluency and fervency which delighted them all amazingly as they ducked and dodged hither and thither to be out of the reach of his riding whip and all whooping off together they tumbled in a pile of immeasurable giggle on the withered turf under the verandah where they kicked up their heels and shouted to their full satisfaction
but you ha nt got em though said andy with a triumphant flourish and making a string of indescribable mouth at the unfortunate trader back when he was fairly beyond hearing
if i had the little devils muttered mr_haley between his teeth i say now mr_shelby this yer a most extro rnary business said mr_haley as he abruptly entered the parlor
it seems that gal off with her young un mr_haley mrs mr_shelby is present said mr_shelby
i beg pardon ma am said mr_haley bowing slightly with a still lowering brow but still i say as i said before this yer a sing lar report
sir said mr_shelby if you wish to communicate with me you must observe something of the decorum of a gentleman
yes sir i regret to say that the young woman excited by overhearing or having reported to her something of this business has taken her child in the night and made off
is it true sir andy take mr_haley hat and riding whip take a seat sir i did expect fair dealing in this matter i confess said mr_haley
well sir said mr_shelby turning sharply round upon him what am i to understand by that remark if any man calls my honor in question i have but one answer for him
the trader cowered at this and in a somewhat lower tone said that it was plaguy hard on a fellow that had made a fair bargain to be gulled that way
mr_haley said mr_shelby if i did not think you had some cause for disappointment i should not have borne from you the rude and unceremonious style of your entrance into my parlor this morning
i say thus much however since appearances call for it that i shall allow of no insinuations cast upon me as if i were at all partner to any unfairness in this matter
moreover i shall feel bound to give you every assistance in the use of horse servant in the recovery of your property
so in short mr_haley said he suddenly dropping from the tone of dignified coolness to his ordinary one of easy frankness
the best way for you is to keep good natured and eat some breakfast and we will then see what is to be done
mrs mr_shelby now rose and said her engagements would prevent her being at the breakfast table that morning and deputing a very respectable mulatto woman to attend to the gentleman coffee at the side board she left the room
old lady dont like your humble servant over and above said mr_haley with an uneasy effort to be very familiar
i am not accustomed to hear my wife spoken of with such freedom said mr_shelby dryly beg pardon of course only a joke you know said mr_haley forcing a laugh
some jokes are less agreeable than others rejoined mr_shelby devilish free now i ve signed those paper cuss him muttered mr_haley to himself quite grand since yesterday
never did fall of any prime minister at court occasion wider surges of sensation than the report of tom_loker fate among his compeers on the place
it was the topic in every mouth everywhere and nothing was done in the house or in the field but to discuss its probable results
black sam as he was commonly called from his being about three shades blacker than any other son of ebony on the place was revolving the matter profoundly in all its phases and bearings with a comprehensiveness of vision and a strict lookout to his own personal well being that would have done credit to any white patriot in washington
eliza_harris flight an unprecedented event on the place was also a great accessory in stimulating the general excitement it an ill wind dat blow
nowhar dat ar a fact said sam sententiously giving an additional hoist to his pantaloons and adroitly substituting a long nail in place of a missing suspender button with which effort of mechanical genius he seemed highly delighted
yes it an ill wind blows nowhar he repeated now dar tom_loker down wal course der room for some nigger to be up and why not dis nigger dat de idee
tom_loker a ridin round de country boots blacked pass in his pocket all grand as cuffee but who he now why shouldnt sam dat what i want to know
halloo sam sam mas wants you to cotch bill and jerry said andy cutting short sam soliloquy high what afoot now young un
you teach your granny said sam with infinite contempt knowed it a heap sight sooner than you did this nigger ant so green now
well anyhow mas wants bill and jerry geared right up and you and i to go with mas mr_haley to look arter her
why you dont know i pose that lizy cut stick and clared out with her young un good now dat de time day said sam
it sam dat called for in dese yer time he de nigger see if i dont cotch her now mas ll see what sam can do
ah but sam said andy you better think twice for missis dont want her cotched and she ll be in yer wool
high said sam opening his eye how you know dat heard her say so my own self dis blessed mornin when i bring in mas s shaving water
she sent me to see why lizy didnt come to dress her and when i telled her she was off she jest ris up and ses she the lord be praised and mas he seemed rael mad and ses he wife you talk like a fool
but lor she ll bring him to i knows well enough how that ll be it allers best to stand missis side the fence now i tell yer
black sam upon this scratched his woolly pate which if it did not contain very profound wisdom still contained a great deal of a particular species much in demand among politicians of all complexions and country and vulgarly denominated knowing which side the bread is buttered so stopping with grave consideration he again gave a hitch to his pantaloons which was his regularly organized method of assisting his mental perplexities
sam spoke like a philosopher emphasizing this as if he had had a large experience in different sort of world and therefore had come to his conclusions advisedly
der ant no saying never bout no kind thing in dis yer world he said at last now sartin i a said that missis would a scoured the varsal world after lizy added sam thoughtfully
so she would said andy but cant ye see through a ladder ye black nigger missis dont want dis yer
mas mr_haley to get lizy boy dat de go high said sam with an indescribable intonation known only to those who have heard it among the negroes
and i ll tell yer more all said andy i specs you better be making tracks for dem hosses mighty sudden too for
sam upon this began to bestir himself in real earnest and after a while appeared bearing down gloriously towards the house with bill and jerry in a full canter and adroitly throwing himself off before they had any idea of stopping he brought them up alongside of the horse post like a tornado
i hearn missis quirin arter yer so you ve stood foolin long enough mr_haley horse which was a skittish young colt winced and bounced and pulled hard at his halter
ho ho said sam skeery ar ye and his black visage lighted up with a curious mischievous gleam
i ll fix ye now said he there was a large beech tree overshadowing the place and the small sharp triangular beech nuts lay scattered thickly on the ground
with one of these in his fingers sam approached the colt stroked and patted and seemed apparently busy in soothing his agitation
on pretence of adjusting the saddle he adroitly slipped under it the sharp little nut in such a manner that the least weight brought upon the saddle would annoy the nervous sensibilities of the animal without leaving any perceptible graze or wound
dar he said rolling his eye with an approving grin me fix em at this moment mrs mr_shelby appeared on the balcony beckoning to him
sam approached with as good a determination to pay court as did ever suitor after a vacant place at st james or washington
lord bless you missis said sam horse wont be cotched all in a minit they done clared out way down to the south pasture and the lord knows whar
why have you been loitering so sam i sent andy to tell you to hurry sam how often must i tell you not to say lord bless you and the lord knows and such thing
it wicked lord bless my soul i done forgot missis i wont say nothing of de sort no more
why sam you just have said it again did i lord i mean i didnt go fur to say it
you must be careful sam just let me get my breath missis and i ll start fair i ll be bery careful
be careful of the horse sam you know jerry was a little lame last week dont ride them too fast
well sam you are to go with mr_haley to show him the road and help him mrs mr_shelby spoke the last word with a low voice and strong emphasis
let dis child alone for dat said sam rolling up his eye with a volume of meaning lord knows high
said he suddenly catching his breath with a ludicrous flourish of apprehension which made his mistress laugh spite of herself
didnt say dat yes missis i ll look out for de hosses now andy said sam returning to his stand under the beech trees you see i wouldnt be t
all surprised if dat ar gen lman crittur should gib a fling by and by when he comes to be a gettin up
you know andy critturs will do such thing and therewith sam poked andy in the side in a highly suggestive manner
high said andy with an air of instant appreciation yes you see andy missis wants to make time dat ar clar to der most
now you see get all dese yer hosses loose caperin permiscus round dis yer lot and down to de wood dar and i spec mas wont be off in a hurry
yer see said sam yer see andy if any such thing should happen as that mas mr_haley horse should begin to act contrary and cut up you and i jist lets go of our to help him and we ll help him
and sam and andy laid their head back on their shoulders and broke into a low immoderate laugh snapping their fingers and flourishing their heels with exquisite delight
or nary bserver i jis make a little for her andy grinned oh yes at this instant mr_haley appeared on the verandah
sam and andy clawing for certain fragmentary palm leaves which they were in the habit of considering as hats flew to the horseposts to be ready to help mas
sam palm leaf had been ingeniously disentangled from all pretensions to braid as respects its brim and the slivers starting apart and standing upright gave it a blazing air of freedom and defiance quite equal to that of any fejee chief while the whole brim of andy being departed bodily he rapped the crown on his head with a dexterous thump and looked about well pleased as if to say who says i havent got a hat
somewhat mollified by certain cups of very good coffee he came out smiling and talking in tolerably restored humor
not a bit of him mas said sam putting mr_haley rein in his hand and holding his stirrup while andy was untying the other two horse
the instant mr_haley touched the saddle the mettlesome creature bounded from the earth with a sudden spring that threw his master sprawling some foot off on the soft dry turf
sam with frantic ejaculations made a dive at the reins but only succeeded in brushing the blazing palm leaf afore named into the horse eye which by no means tended to allay the confusion of his nerves
so with great vehemence he overturned sam and giving two or three contemptuous snorts flourished his heels vigorously in the air and was soon prancing away towards the lower end of the lawn followed by bill and jerry whom andy had not failed to let loose according to contract speeding them off with various direful ejaculations
well boy said mr_haley look alive now we must lose no time and now ensued a miscellaneous scene of confusion sam and andy ran and shouted dog barked here
and there and mike mose mandy fanny and all the smaller specimens on the place both male and female raced clapped hand whooped and shouted with outrageous officiousness and untiring zeal
mr_haley horse which was a white one and very fleet and spirited appeared to enter into the spirit of the scene with great gusto and having for his coursing ground a lawn of nearly half a mile in extent gently sloping down on every side into indefinite woodland he appeared to take infinite delight in seeing how near he could allow his pursuers to approach him and then when within a hand breadth whisk off with a start and a snort like a mischievous beast as he was and career far down into some alley of the wood lot
nothing was further from sam mind than to have any one of the troop taken until such season as should seem to him most befitting and
like the sword of coeur de lion which always blazed in the front and thickest of the battle sam palm leaf was to be seen everywhere when there was the least danger that a horse could be caught there he would bear down full tilt shouting now for it
the exertions that he made were certainly most heroic cotch him cotch him in a way that would set everything to indiscriminate rout in a moment
mr_shelby in vain tried to shout directions from the balcony and mrs mr_shelby from her chamber window alternately laughed and wondered not without some inkling of what lay at the bottom of all this confusion
at last about twelve clock sam appeared triumphant mounted on jerry with mr_haley horse by his side reeking with sweat but with flashing eye and dilated nostrils showing that the spirit of freedom had not yet entirely subsided
mr_haley ran up and down and cursed and swore and stamped miscellaneously he cotched he exclaimed triumphantly ift hadnt been for me they might a bust themselves all on em but i cotched him
lord bless us mas said sam in a tone of the deepest concern and me that has been racin and chasin till the sweat jest pours off me
you growled mr_haley in no amiable mood if it hadnt been for you this never would have happened
well well said mr_haley you ve lost me near three hour with your cursed nonsense now let be off and have no more fooling
why mas said sam in a deprecating tone i believe you mean to kill us all clar horse and all
here we are all just ready to drop down and the critters all in a reek of sweat why mas wont think of startin on now till arter dinner
mas s hoss wants rubben down see how he splashed hisself and jerry limps too dont think missis would be willin to have us start dis yer way no how
lord bless you mas we can ketch up if we do stop lizy never was no great of a walker
mrs mr_shelby who greatly to her amusement had overheard this conversation from the verandah now resolved to do her part
she came forward and courteously expressing her concern for mr_haley accident pressed him to stay to dinner saying that the cook should bring it on the table immediately
thus all thing considered mr_haley with rather an equivocal grace proceeded to the parlor while sam rolling his eye after him with unutterable meaning proceeded gravely with the horse to the stable yard
did yer see him said sam when he had got fairly beyond the shelter of the barn and fastened the horse to a post
did yer see him andy lor if it warnt as good as a meetin now to see him a dancin and kickin and swarin at us
swar away ole fellow says i to myself will yer have yer hoss now or wait till you cotch him
didnt i hear him says i lor andy i think i can see him now and sam and andy leaned up against the barn and laughed to their heart content
yer oughter seen how mad he looked when i brought the hoss up lord he a killed me if he durs to and there i was a standin as innercent and as humble
lor i seed you said andy ant you an old hoss sam rather specks i am said sam did yer see missis up stars at the winder
well yer see said sam proceeding gravely to wash down mr_haley pony i se quired what yer may call a habit bobservation andy
i seed her laughin i sure i was racin so i didnt see nothing said andy it a very portant habit andy and i commend yer to be cultivatin
it now yer young hist up that hind foot andy yer see andy it bobservation makes all de difference in nigger

dat ar bobservation andy i spects it what you may call a faculty faculties is different in different people but cultivation of em goes a great way
i guess if i hadnt helped your bobservation dis mornin yer wouldnt have seen your way so smart said andy
andy said sam you a promisin child der ant no manner doubt i thinks lots of yer andy and i dont feel no way ashamed to take idees from you
we oughtenter overlook nobody andy cause the smartest on us gets tripped up sometimes and so andy let go up to the house now
it is impossible to conceive of a human creature more wholly desolate and forlorn than eliza_harris when she turned her footsteps from uncle tom_loker cabin
her husband suffering and dangers and the danger of her child all blended in her mind with a confused and stunning sense of the risk she was running in leaving the only home she had ever known and cutting loose from the protection of a friend whom she loved and revered
then there was the parting from every familiar object the place where she had grown up the trees under which she had played the groves where she had walked many an evening in happier day by the side of her young husband everything as it lay in the clear frosty starlight seemed to speak reproachfully to her and ask her whither could she go from a home like that
but stronger than all was maternal love wrought into a paroxysm of frenzy by the near approach of a fearful danger
her boy was old enough to have walked by her side and in an indifferent case she would only have led him by the hand but now the bare thought of putting him out of her arm made her shudder and she strained him to her bosom with a convulsive grasp as she went rapidly forward
the frosty ground creaked beneath her foot and she trembled at the sound every quaking leaf and fluttering shadow sent the blood backward to her heart and quickened her footsteps
she wondered within herself at the strength that seemed to be come upon her for she felt the weight of her boy as if it had been a feather and every flutter of fear seemed to increase the supernatural power that bore her on while from her pale lips burst forth in frequent ejaculations the prayer to a friend above lord help
i ll be boun missis ll give us an uncommon good bite dis yer time chapter vii the mother struggle lord save me
if it were your harry mother or your willie that were going to be torn from you by a brutal trader tomorrow morning if you had seen the man and heard that the paper were signed and delivered and you had only from twelve clock till morning to make good your escape how fast could you walk
how many miles could you make in those few brief hour with the darling at your bosom the little sleepy head on your shoulder the small soft arm trustingly holding on to your neck
at first the novelty and alarm kept him waking but his mother so hurriedly repressed every breath or sound and so assured him that if he were only still she would certainly save him that he clung quietly round her neck only asking as he found himself sinking to sleep mother i dont need to keep awake do i
for the child slept no my darling sleep if you want to but mother if i do get asleep you wont let him get me
no so may god help me said his mother with a paler cheek and a brighter light in her large dark eye
yes sure said the mother in a voice that startled herself for it seemed to her to come from a spirit within
that was no part of her and the boy dropped his little weary head on her shoulder and was soon asleep
how the touch of those warm arm the gentle breathings that came in her neck seemed to add fire and spirit to her movements
it seemed to her as if strength poured into her in electric streams from every gentle touch and movement of the sleeping confiding child
sublime is the dominion of the mind over the body that for a time can make flesh and nerve impregnable and string the sinews like steel so that the weak become so mighty
the boundaries of the farm the grove the wood lot passed by her dizzily as she walked on and still she went leaving one familiar object after another slacking not pausing not till reddening daylight found her many a long mile from all traces of any familiar objects upon the open highway
she had often been with her mistress to visit some connections in the little village oft not far from the ohio river and knew the road well
to go thither to escape across the ohio river were the first hurried outlines of her plan of escape beyond that she could only hope in god
when horse and vehicles began to move along the highway with that alert perception peculiar to a state of excitement and which seems to be a sort of inspiration she became aware that her headlong pace and distracted air might bring on her remark and suspicion
she therefore put the boy on the ground and adjusting her dress and bonnet she walked on at as rapid a pace as she thought consistent with the preservation of appearances
in her little bundle she had provided a store of cakes and apples which she used as expedients for quickening the speed of the child rolling the apple some yards before them when the boy would run with all his might after it and this ruse often repeated carried them over many a half mile
you re sure ant you mother after a while they came to a thick patch of woodland through which murmured a clear brook
as the child complained of hunger and thirst she climbed over the fence with him and sitting down behind a large rock which concealed them from the road she gave him a breakfast out of her little package
the boy wondered and grieved that she could not eat and when putting his arm round her neck he tried to wedge some of his cake into her mouth it seemed to her that the rising in her throat would choke her
no no harry darling mother cant eat till you are safe we must go on on till we come to the river
and she hurried again into the road and again constrained herself to walk regularly and composedly forward she was many miles past any neighborhood where she was personally known
if she should chance to meet any who knew her she reflected that the well known kindness of the family would be of itself a blind to suspicion as making it an unlikely supposition that she could be a fugitive
as she was also so white as not to be known as of colored lineage without a critical survey and her child was white also it was much easier for her to pass on unsuspected
on this presumption she stopped at noon at a neat farmhouse to rest herself and buy some dinner for her child and self for as the danger decreased with the distance the supernatural tension of the nervous system lessened and she found herself both weary and hungry
the good woman kindly and gossipping seemed rather pleased than otherwise with having somebody come in to talk with and accepted without examination eliza_harris statement that she was going on a little piece to spend a week with her friend all which she hoped in her heart might prove strictly true
an hour before sunset she entered the village oft by the ohio river weary and foot sore but still strong in heart
her first glance was at the river which lay like jordan between her and the canaan of liberty on the other side
it was now early spring and the river was swollen and turbulent great cakes of floating ice were swinging heavily to and fro in the turbid water
owing to the peculiar form of the shore on the kentucky side the land bending far out into the water the ice had been lodged and detained in great quantities and the narrow channel which swept round the bend was full of ice piled one cake over another thus forming a temporary barrier to the descending ice which lodged and formed a great undulating raft filling up the whole river and extending almost to the kentucky shore
eliza_harris stood for a moment contemplating this unfavorable aspect of thing which she saw at once must prevent the usual ferry boat from running and then turned into a small public house on the bank to make a few inquiries
the hostess who was busy in various fizzing and stewing operations over the fire preparatory to the evening meal stopped with a fork in her hand as eliza_harris sweet and plaintive voice arrested her
what is it she said isnt there any ferry or boat that takes people over to now she said
eliza_harris look of dismay and disappointment struck the woman and she said inquiringly may be you re wanting to get over anybody sick
no indeed said the woman the boat has stopped running ye seem mighty anxious i ve got a child that very dangerous said eliza_harris
i never heard of it till last night and i ve walked quite a piece today in hopes to get to the ferry
well now that onlucky said the woman whose motherly sympathies were much aroused i re lly consarned for ye
solomon she called from the window towards a small back building a man in leather apron and very dirty hand appeared at the door
i say sol said the woman is that ar man going to tote them bar ls over tonight he said he should try ift was any way prudent said the man
there a man a piece down here that going over with some truck this evening if he durs to he ll be in here to supper tonight so you better set down and wait
that a sweet little fellow added the woman offering him a cake but the child wholly exhausted cried with weariness
poor fellow he isnt used to walking and i ve hurried him on so said eliza_harris well take him into this room said the woman opening into a small bed room where stood a comfortable bed
eliza_harris laid the weary boy upon it and held his hand in hers till he was fast asleep for her there was no rest
as a fire in her bones the thought of the pursuer urged her on and she gazed with longing eye on the sullen surging water that lay between her and liberty
though mrs mr_shelby had promised that the dinner should be hurried on table yet it was soon seen as the thing has often been seen before that it required more than one to make a bargain
so although the order was fairly given out in mr_haley hearing and carried to aunt_chloe by at least half a dozen juvenile messengers that dignitary only gave certain very gruff snorts and tosses of her head and went on with every operation in an unusually leisurely and circumstantial manner
for some singular reason an impression seemed to reign among the servant generally that missis would not be particularly disobliged by delay and it was wonderful what a number of counter accidents occurred constantly to retard the course of thing
one luckless wight contrived to upset the gravy and then gravy had to be got up de novo with due care and formality aunt_chloe watching and stirring with dogged precision answering shortly to all suggestions of haste that she warnt a going to have raw gravy on the table to help nobody catchings
one tumbled down with the water and had to go to the spring for more and another precipitated the butter into the path of events and there was from time to time giggling news brought into the kitchen that mas mr_haley was mighty oneasy and that he couldnt sit in his cheer no way but was a walkin and stalkin to the winders and through the porch
here we must take our leave of her for the present to follow the course of her pursuers sarves him right said aunt_chloe indignantly
he ll get wus nor oneasy one of these day if he dont mend his way his master ll be sending for him and then see how he ll look
he ll go to torment and no mistake said little jake he desarves it said aunt_chloe grimly he broke a many many many heart i tell ye all
what mas george_harris reads in ravelations soul a callin under the altar and a callin on the lord for vengeance on sich and by and by the lord he ll hear em so he will
aunt_chloe who was much revered in the kitchen was listened to with open mouth and the dinner being now fairly sent in the whole kitchen was at leisure to gossip with her and to listen to her remarks
she said stopping with a fork uplifted in her hand it like sich ll be burnt up forever and no mistake wont ther said andy
i be glad to see it i ll be boun said little jake chil en said a voice that made them all start
it was uncle tom_loker who had come in and stood listening to the conversation at the door chil en he said i afeard you dont know what ye re sayin
forever is a dre ful word chil en it awful to think ont you oughtenter wish that ar to any human crittur
we wouldnt to anybody but the soul drivers said andy nobody can help wishing it to them they so awful wicked
dont dey tear der suckin baby right off his mother breast and sell him and der little child as is crying and holding on by her clothes dont dey pull em off and sells em
dont dey tear wife and husband apart said aunt_chloe beginning to cry when it jest takin the very life on
dont natur herself kinder cry out on em said aunt_chloe em and all the while does they feel one bit dont dey drink and smoke and take it oncommon easy
lor if the devil dont get them what he good for and aunt_chloe covered her face with her checked apron and began to sob in good earnest
pray for them that spitefully use you the good book says says tom_loker pray for em said aunt_chloe lor it too tough
the lord grace is stronger besides you oughter think what an awful state a poor crittur soul in that ll do them
i cant pray for em it natur aunt_chloe and natur strong said tom_loker but ar thing you oughter thank god that you ant like him aunt_chloe
i sure i rather be sold ten thousand time over than to have all that ar poor crittur got to answer for
so i a heap said jake lor shouldnt we cotch it andy andy shrugged his shoulders and gave an acquiescent whistle
i glad mas didnt go off this morning as he looked to said tom_loker that ar hurt me more than sellin it did
mebbe it might have been natural for him butt would have come despt hard on me as has known him from a baby but i ve seen mas and i begin ter feel sort reconciled to the lord will now
mas couldnt help hisself he did right but i feared thing will be kinder goin to rack when i gone mas cant be spected to be a pryin round everywhar as i ve done a keepin up all the ends
the boy all means well but they powerful car less that ar troubles me the bell here rang and tom_loker was summoned to the parlor
tom_loker said his master kindly i want you to notice that i give this gentleman bonds to forfeit a thousand dollar if you are not on the spot when he wants you he going today to look after his other business and you can have the day to yourself
and mind yourself said the trader and dont come it over your master with any yer nigger tricks for i ll take every cent out of him if you ant thar
go anywhere you like boy thank you mas said tom_loker if he hear to me he wouldnt trust any on ye
mas said tom_loker and he stood very straight i was jist eight year old when ole missis put you into my arm and you wasnt a year old
and now i jist ask you mas have i ever broke word to you or gone contrary to you specially since i was a christian
slippery as eels thar says she tom_loker that to be your young mas take good care on him says she mr_shelby was fairly overcome and the tear rose to his eye
my good boy said he the lord knows you say but the truth and if i was able to help it all the world shouldnt buy you
and sure as i am a christian woman said mrs mr_shelby you shall be redeemed as soon as i can any way bring together means
lor yes for that matter said the trader i may bring him up in a year not much the wuss for wear and trade him back
sir she said to mr_haley take good account of who you sell him to and let me know
i ll trade with you then and make it for your advantage said mrs mr_shelby of course said the trader all equal with me li ves trade em up as down
so i does a good business all i want is a livin you know ma am that all any on us wants i pose
mr and mrs mr_shelby both felt annoyed and degraded by the familiar impudence of the trader and yet both saw the absolute necessity of putting a constraint on their feeling
the more hopelessly sordid and insensible he appeared the greater became mrs mr_shelby dread of his succeeding in recapturing eliza_harris and her child and of course the greater her motive for detaining him by every female artifice
at two clock sam and andy brought the horse up to the posts apparently greatly refreshed and invigorated by the scamper of the morning
she therefore graciously smiled assented chatted familiarly and did all she could to make time pass imperceptibly sam was there new oiled from dinner with an abundance of zealous and ready officiousness
as mr_haley approached he was boasting in flourishing style to andy of the evident and eminent success of the operation now that he had farly come to it
your master i pose dont keep no dog said mr_haley thoughtfully as he prepared to mount heaps on em said sam triumphantly thar bruno he a roarer
he said something else too with regard to the said dog at which sam muttered i dont see no use cussin on em no way
and besides that bout every nigger of us keeps a pup of some natur or uther poh said mr_haley and
but your master dont keep no dog i pretty much know he dont for trackin out nigger sam knew exactly what he meant but he kept on a look of earnest and desperate simplicity
our dog all smells round considable sharp i spect they the kind though they hant never had no practice they far dog though at most anything if you get em started
here bruno he called whistling to the lumbering newfoundland who came pitching tumultuously toward them you go hang said mr_haley getting up
sam tumbled up accordingly dexterously contriving to tickle andy as he did so which occasioned andy to split out into a laugh greatly to mr_haley indignation who made a cut at him with his riding whip
come tumble up now i stonished at yer andy said sam with awful gravity this yer a seris bisness andy
i shall take the straight road to the river said mr_haley decidedly after they had come to the boundaries of the estate
yer mustnt be a makin game this yer ant no way to help mas i know the way of all of em they makes tracks for the underground
sartin said sam dat de idee mas mr_haley hits de thing right in de middle now der two road to de river de dirt road and der pike which mas mean to take
andy looked up innocently at sam surprised at hearing this new geographical fact but instantly confirmed what he said by a vehement reiteration
cause said sam i rather be clined to magine that lizy take de dirt road bein it the least travelled
mr_haley notwithstanding that he was a very old mrs_bird and naturally inclined to be suspicious of chaff was rather brought up by this view of the case
if yer warnt both on yer such cussed liars now he said contemplatively as he pondered a moment
the pensive reflective tone in which this was spoken appeared to amuse andy prodigiously and he drew a little behind and shook so as apparently to run a great risk of failing off his horse while sam face was immovably composed into the most doleful gravity
course said sam mas can do as he ruther go de straight road if mas thinks best it all one to us
now when i study pon it i think de straight road de best deridedly she would naturally go a lonesome way said mr_haley thinking aloud and not minding sam remark
dar ant no sayin said sam gal is pecular they never does nothing ye thinks they will mose gen lly the contrary
gal is nat lly made contrary and so if you thinks they ve gone one road it is sartin you better got other and then you ll be sure to find em
this profound generic view of the female sex did not seem to dispose mr_haley particularly to the straight road and he announced decidedly that he should go the other and asked sam when they should come to it
a little piece ahead said sam giving a wink to andy with the eye which was on andy side of the head and he added gravely but
now my private pinion is lizy took der road so i think we better take de straight one i ve studded on de matter and i quite clar
we ought not to go dat ar way i nebber been over it no way it despit lonesome and we might lose our way whar
now i think ont i think i hearn em tell that dat ar road was all fenced up and down by der creek and thar an t
we come to de lord only knows nevertheless said mr_haley i shall go that way it andy andy wasnt certain he only hearn tell about that road but never been over it
mr_haley accustomed to strike the balance of probabilities between lies of greater or lesser magnitude thought that it lay in favor of the dirt road aforesaid
the mention of the thing he thought he perceived was involuntary on sam part at first and his confused attempts to dissuade him
in short he was strictly noncommittal he set down to a desperate lying on second thoughts as being unwilling to implicate liza
now the road in fact was an old one that had formerly been a thoroughfare to the river but abandoned for many year after the laying of the new pike
when therefore sam indicated the road mr_haley plunged briskly into it followed by sam and andy it was open for about an hour ride and after that it was cut across by various farms and fences
sam knew this fact perfectly well indeed the road had been so long closed up that andy had never heard of it
he therefore rode along with an air of dutiful submission only groaning and vociferating occasionally thatt was despt rough and bad for jerry foot
now i jest give yer warning said mr_haley i know yer yer wont get me to turn off this road with all yer fussin so you shet up
mas will go his own way said sam with rueful submission at the same time winking most portentously to andy whose delight was now very near the explosive point
sam was in wonderful spirit professed to keep a very brisk lookout at one time exclaiming that he saw a gal bonnet on the top of some distant eminence or calling to andy if that thar wasnt lizy down in the hollow always making these exclamations in some rough or craggy part of the road where the sudden quickening of speed was a special inconvenience to all party concerned and thus keeping mr_haley in a state of constant commotion
after riding about an hour in this way the whole party made a precipitate and tumultuous descent into a barn yard belonging to a large farming establishment
not a soul was in sight all the hand being employed in the fields but as the barn stood conspicuously and plainly square across the road it was evident that their journey in that direction had reached a decided finale
want dat ar what i telled mas said sam with an air of injured innocence how does strange gentleman spect to know more about a country dan de natives born and raised
you rascal said mr_haley you knew all about this didnt i tell yer i knowd and yer wouldnt believe me
i telled mas rt was all shet up and fenced up and i didnt spect we could get through andy heard me
it was all too true to be disputed and the unlucky man had to pocket his wrath with the best grace he was able and all three faced to the right about and took up their line of march for the highway
in consequence of all the various delays it was about three quarters of an hour after eliza_harris had laid her child to sleep in the village tavern that the party came riding into the same place
eliza_harris was standing by the window looking out in another direction when sam quick eye caught a glimpse of her
at this crisis sam contrived to have his hat blown off and uttered a loud and characteristic ejaculation which startled her at once she drew suddenly back the whole train swept by the window round to the front door
mr_haley and andy were two yards behind a thousand life seemed to be concentrated in that one moment to eliza_harris her room opened by a side door to the river
the trader caught a full glimpse of her just as she was disappearing down the bank and throwing himself from his horse and calling loudly on sam and andy he was after her like a hound after a deer
in that dizzy moment her foot to her scarce seemed to touch the ground and a moment brought her to the water edge
right on behind they came and nerved with strength such as god gives only to the desperate with one wild cry and flying leap she vaulted sheer over the turbid current by the shore on to the raft of ice beyond
it was a desperate leap impossible to anything but madness and despair and mr_haley sam and andy instinctively cried out and lifted up their hand as she did it
the huge green fragment of ice on which she alighted pitched and creaked as her weight came on it but she staid there not a moment
she caught her child and sprang down the steps towards it with wild cries and desperate energy she leaped to another and still another cake stumbling leaping slipping springing upwards again
her shoes are gone her stockings cut from her foot while blood marked every step but she saw nothing felt nothing till dimly as in a dream she saw the ohio side and a man helping her up the bank
yer a brave gal now whoever ye ar said the man with an oath eliza_harris recognized the voice and face for a man who owned a farm not far from her old home
mr symmes save me do save me do hide me said elia why what this said the man why if tant mr_shelby gal
my child this boy he sold him there is his mas said she pointing to the kentucky shore mr symmes you ve got a little boy
so i have said the man as he roughly but kindly drew her up the steep bank besides you re a right brave gal
i like grit wherever i see it when they had gained the top of the bank the man paused
the best i can do is to tell ye to go thar said he pointing to a large white house which stood by itself off the main street of the village
i be glad to do something for ye said he but then there nowhar i could take ye go thar they re kind folks
thar no kind danger but they ll help you they re up to all that sort thing the lord bless you said eliza_harris earnestly
no casion no casion in the world said the man what i ve done of no count and oh surely sir you wont tell any one
go to thunder gal what do you take a feller for in course not said the man come now go along like a likely sensible gal as you are
you ve arnt your liberty and you shall have it for all me the woman folded her child to her bosom and walked firmly and swiftly away
the man stood and looked after her mr_shelby now mebbe wont think this yer the most neighborly thing in the world but what a feller to do
somehow i never could see no kind critter a strivin and pantin and trying to clar theirselves with the dog arter em and go agin em
if he catches one of my gal in the same fix he welcome to pay back besides i dont see no kind of casion for me to be hunter and catcher for other folks neither
so spoke this poor heathenish kentuckian who had not been instructed in his constitutional relations and consequently was betrayed into acting in a sort of christianized manner which if he had been better situated and more enlightened he would not have been left to do
mr_haley had stood a perfectly amazed spectator of the scene till eliza_harris had disappeared up the bank when he turned a blank inquiring look on sam and andy
that ar was a tolable fair stroke of business said sam the gal got seven devils in her i believe said mr_haley
how like a wildcat she jumped wal now said sam scratching his head i hope mas ll scuse us trying dat ar road
dont think i feel spry enough for dat ar no way and sam gave a hoarse chuckle you laugh said the trader with a growl
lord bless you mas i couldnt help it now said sam giving way to the long pent up delight of his soul
she looked so curi a leapin and springin ice a crackin and only to hear her plump ker chunk ker splash spring
lord how she goes it and sam and andy laughed till the tear rolled down their cheeks i ll make ye laught other side
yer mouth said the trader laying about their head with his riding whip both ducked and ran shouting up the bank and were on their horse before he was up
good evening mas said sam with much gravity i berry much spect missis be anxious bout jerry mas mr_haley wont want us no longer
missis wouldnt hear of our ridin the critters over lizy bridge tonight and with a facetious poke into andy ribs he started off followed by the latter at full speed their shouts of laughter coming faintly on the wind
the gray mist of evening rising slowly from the river enveloped her as she disappeared up the bank and the swollen current and floundering masses of ice presented a hopeless barrier between her and her pursuer
chapter viii eliza_harris escape eliza_harris made her desperate retreat across the river just in the dusk of twilight mr_haley therefore slowly and discontentedly returned to the little tavern to ponder further what was to be done
the woman opened to him the door of a little parlor covered with a rag carpet where stood a table with a very shining black oil cloth sundry lank high backed wood chair with some plaster images in resplendent colors on the mantel shelf above a very dimly smoking grate a long hard wood settle extended its uneasy length by the chimney and here mr_haley sat him down to meditate on the instability of human hopes and happiness in general
what did i want with the little cuss now he said to himself that i should have got myself treed like a coon as i am this yer way and mr_haley relieved himself by repeating over a not very select litany of imprecations on himself which though there was the best possible reason to consider them as true we shall as a matter of taste omit
he was startled by the loud and dissonant voice of a man who was apparently dismounting at the door he hurried to the window
by the land if this yer ant the nearest now to what i ve heard folks call providence said mr_haley
standing by the bar in the corner of the room was a brawny muscular man full six foot in height and broad in proportion
he was dressed in a coat of buffalo skin made with the hair outward which gave him a shaggy and fierce appearance perfectly in keeping with the whole air of his physiognomy
in the head and face every organ and lineament expressive of brutal and unhesitating violence was in a state of the highest possible development
indeed could our readers fancy a bull dog come unto man estate and walking about in a hat and coat they would have no unapt idea of the general style and effect of his physique
i do lieve that ar tom_loker mr_haley hastened out he was accompanied by a travelling companion in many respects an exact contrast to himself
he was short and slender lithe and catlike in his motions and had a peering mousing expression about his keen black eye with which every feature of his face seemed sharpened into sympathy his thin long nose ran out as if it was eager to bore into the nature of thing in general his sleek thin black hair was stuck eagerly forward and all his motions and evolutions expressed a dry cautious acuteness
the little man stood tiptoe and putting his head first to one side and then the other and snuffing considerately in the directions of the various bottles ordered at last a mint julep in a thin and quivering voice and with an air of great circumspection
when poured out he took it and looked at it with a sharp complacent air like a man who thinks he has done about the right thing and hit the nail on the head and proceeded to dispose of it in short and well advised sips
the great man poured out a big tumbler half full of raw spirit and gulped it down without a word
wal now who a thought this yer luck ad come to me why tom_loker how are ye said mr_haley coming forward and extending his hand to the big man
the mousing man who bore the name of marks instantly stopped his sipping and poking his head forward looked shrewdly on the new acquaintance as a cat sometimes looks at a moving dry leaf or some other possible object of pursuit
the devil was the civil reply what brought you here mr_haley i say tom_loker this yer the luckiest thing in the world
i in a devil of a hobble and you must help me out ugh aw like enough grunted his complacent acquaintance
a body may be pretty sure of that when you re glad to see em something to be made off of em
what the blow now you ve got a friend here said mr_haley looking doubtfully at marks partner perhaps yes i have
here marks here that ar feller that i was in with in natchez shall be pleased with his acquaintance said marks thrusting out a long thin hand like a raven claw
and now gentleman seein as we ve met so happily i think i ll stand up to a small matter of a treat in this here parlor
so now old coon said he to the man at the bar get us hot water and sugar and cigars and plenty of the real stuff
behold then the candles lighted the fire stimulated to the burning point in the grate and our three worthies seated round a table well spread with all the accessories to good fellowship enumerated before
mr_haley i believe the same sir said mr_haley and we ll have a blow out mr_haley began a pathetic recital of his peculiar troubles
marks who was anxiously and with much fidgeting compounding a tumbler of punch to his own peculiar taste occasionally looked up from his employment and poking his sharp nose and chin almost into mr_haley face gave the most earnest heed to the whole narrative
the conclusion of it appeared to amuse him extremely for he shook his shoulders and side in silence and perked up his thin lips with an air of great internal enjoyment
tom_loker shut up his mouth and listened to him with gruff and surly attention so then ye fairly sewed up ant ye
he said he he he it neatly done too this yer young un business makes lots of trouble in the trade said mr_haley dolefully
if we could get a breed of gal that didnt care now for their young uns said marks tell ye
i thinkt would be bout the greatest mod rn improvement i knows on and marks patronized his joke by a quiet introductory sniggle
jes so said mr_haley i never couldnt see into it young uns is heaps of trouble to em one would think now they be glad to get clar on em but they arnt
and the more trouble a young un is and the more good for nothing as a gen thing the tighter they sticks to em
wal mr_haley said marks est pass the hot water yes sir you say est what i feel and all us have
now i bought a gal once when i was in the trade a tight likely wench she was too and quite considerable
she had a young un that was mis able sickly it had a crooked back or something or other and i jest gint away to a man that thought he take his chance raising ont being it didnt cost nothing never thought yer know of the gal takin on about it but lord yer oughter seen how she went on
why re lly she did seem to me to valley the child more causet was sickly and cross and plagued her and she warnt making lieve neither cried about it she did and lopped round as if she lost every friend she had
smart and it re lly was droll to think ont lord there aint no end to woman notions wal jest so with me said mr_haley
last summer down on red river i got a gal traded off on me with a likely lookin child enough and his eye looked as bright as yourn but come to look i found him stone blind
fact he was stone blind wal ye see i thought there warnt no harm in my jest passing him along and not sayin nothing
and i got him nicely swapped off for a keg whiskey but come to get him away from the gal
sot was before we started and i hadnt got my gang chained up so what should she do but ups on a cotton bale like a cat ketches a knife from one of the deck hand and
i tell ye she made all fly for a minit till she sawt want no use and she jest turns round and pitches head first young un and all into the river went down plump and never ris
she was jest like a tiger bah said tom_loker who had listened to these stories with ill repressed disgust shif less both on ye
my gal dont cut up no such shines i tell ye indeed how do you help it said marks briskly help it
why i buys a gal and if she got a young un to be sold i jest walks up and puts my fist to her face and says look here now if you give me one word out of your head i ll smash yer face in
i wont hear one word not the beginning of a word i says to em this yer young un mine and not yourn and you ve no kind business with it
i going to sell it first chance mind you dont cut up none yer shines about it or i ll make ye wish ye never been born
i makes em as whist as fishes and if one on em begins and gives a yelp why and mr tom_loker brought down his fist with a thump that fully explained the hiatus
that ar what ye may call emphasis said marks poking mr_haley in the side and going into another small giggle
i tell ye they sees it ant no play when i gets hold ant tom_loker peculiar he he i say tom_loker i pect you make em understand for all nigger head is woolly
they dont never have no doubt your meaning tom_loker if you ant the devil tom_loker you his twin brother
tom_loker received the compliment with becoming modesty and began to look as affable as was consistent as john_bunyan says with his doggish nature
mr_haley who had been imbibing very freely of the staple of the evening began to feel a sensible elevation and enlargement of his moral faculties a phenomenon not unusual with gentleman of a serious and reflective turn under similar circumstances
wal now tom_loker he said ye re lly is too bad as i al ays have told ye ye know tom_loker you and i used to talk over these yer matter down in natchez and i used to prove to ye that we made full as much and was as well off for this yer world by treatin on em well besides keepin a better chance for comin in the kingdom at last when wust comes to wust and thar ant nothing else left to get ye know
i ll say that for ye boh said tom_loker dont i know dont make me too sick with any
i say said mr_haley and leaning back in his chair and gesturing impressively i ll say this now i al ays meant to drive my trade so as to make money ont fust and foremost as much as any man but then trade ant everything and money ant everything cause we all got soul
yer stuff my stomach is a leetle riled now and tom_loker drank half a glass of raw brandy i dont care now who hears me say it and
i think a cussed sight on it so i may as well come out with it i lieve in religion and one of these day when i ve got matter tight and snug
i calculates to tend to my soul and them ar matter and so what the use of doin any more wickedness than re lly necessary it dont seem to me
it st all prudent tend to yer soul repeated tom_loker contemptuously take a bright lookout to find a soul in you save yourself any care on that score
if the devil sifts you through a hair sieve he wont find one why tom_loker you re cross said mr_haley why cant ye take it pleasant now when a feller talking for your good
stop that ar jaw yourn there said tom_loker gruffly i can stand most any talk yourn but your pious
that you care one bit more or have a bit more feelin it clean sheer dog meanness wanting to cheat the devil and save your own skin dont i see through it
and your gettin religion as you call it arter all is too isin mean for any crittur run up a bill with the devil all your life and then sneak out when pay time comes
talk that kills me right up after all what the odds between me and you tant bob come come gentleman i say this isnt business said marks
mr_haley is a very nice man no doubt and has his own conscience and tom_loker you have your way and very good one too tom_loker but quarrelling you know wont answer no kind of purpose
there different way you know of looking at all subjects let go to business now mr_haley what is it you want us to undertake to catch this yer gal
the gal no matter of mine she mr_shelby it only the boy i was a fool for buying the monkey
come now tom_loker none of your huffs said marks licking his lips you see mr_haley a puttin us in a way of a good job i reckon just hold still these yer arrangements is my forte
you re generally a fool said tom_loker gruffly this yer gal mr_haley how is she what is she
wal white and handsome well brought up i a gin mr_shelby eight hundred or a thousand and then made well on her
white and handsome well brought up said marks his sharp eye nose and mouth all alive with enterprise look here now tom_loker a beautiful opening
we ll do a business here on our own account we does the catchin the boy of course goes to mr_haley we takes the gal to orleans to speculate on
tom_loker whose great heavy mouth had stood ajar during this communication now suddenly snapped it together as a big dog closes on a piece of meat and seemed to be digesting the idea at his leisure
ye see said marks to mr_haley stirring his punch as he did so ye see we has justices convenient at all ints along shore that does up any little jobs in our line quite reasonable
tom_loker he does the knockin down and that ar and i come in all dressed up shining boots everything first chop when the swearin to be done
ant it beautiful you oughter see now said marks in a glow of professional pride how i can tone it off
one day i mr twickem from new orleans nother day i just come from my plantation on pearl river where i work seven hundred nigger then again i come out a distant relation of henry clay or some old cock in kentuck
now tom_loker roarer when there any thumping or fighting to be done but at lying he ant good tom_loker ant ye see it dont come natural to him but lord if thar a feller in the country that can swear to anything and everything and put in all the circumstances and flourishes with a long face and carryt through better
talents is different you know i can why i like to see him that all i lieve my heart i could get along and snake through even if justices were more particular than they is
sometimes i rather wish they was more particulart would be a heap more relishin if they was more fun yer know
tom_loker who as we have made it appear was a man of slow thoughts and movements here interrupted marks by bringing his heavy fist down on the table so as to make all ring again it ll do
he said lord bless ye tom_loker ye neednt break all the glasses said marks save your fist for time need
but gentleman ant i to come in for a share of the profits said mr_haley ant it enough we catch the boy for ye
said tom_loker what do ye want wal said mr_haley if i gives you the job it worth something say ten per cent
now said tom_loker with a tremendous oath and striking the table with his heavy fist dont i know you dan mr_haley
suppose marks and i have taken up the catchin trade jest to commodate gentleman like you and get nothing for ourselves not by a long chalk
on the profits expenses paid dont you think to come it over me we ll have the gal out and out and you keep quiet or
ye see we ll have both what to hinder hant you show us the game it as free to us as you i hope
if you or mr_shelby wants to chase us look where the partridges was last year if you find them or us you re quite welcome
wal certainly jest let it go at that said mr_haley alarmed you catch the boy for the job you allers did trade far with me tom_loker and was up to yer word
ye know that said tom_loker i dont pretend none of your snivelling way but i wont lie in my counts with the devil himself
what i ses i ll do i will do you know that dan mr_haley jes so jes so i said so tom_loker said mr_haley
and if you only promise to have the boy for me in a week at any point you ll name that all i want
ye dont think i did business with you down in natchez for nothing mr_haley i ve learned to hold an eel when i catch him
but it ant all i want by a long jump said tom_loker you ve got to fork over fifty dollar flat down or this child dont start a peg
why when you have a job in hand that may bring a clean profit of somewhere about a thousand or sixteen hundred why tom_loker you re onreasonable said mr_haley
i know yer yes and hasnt we business booked for five weeks to come all we can do and suppose we leaves all and goes to bush whacking round arter yer young uns and finally doesnt catch
the gal and gal allers is the devil to catch what then would you pay us a cent would you i think i see you a doin it

if i find the young un i ll bring him on to cincinnati and leave him at granny belcher on the landing said tom_loker
marks had got from his pocket a greasy pocket book and taking a long paper from thence he sat down and fixing his keen black eye on it began mumbling over its contents barnes mr_shelby county boy jim_crow three hundred dollar for him dead or alive
edwards dick and lucy man and wife six hundred dollar wench polly and two child six hundred for her or her head
tom_loker he said after a pause we must set adams and springer on the track of these yer they ve been booked some time
i jest a runnin over our business to see if we can take up this yer handily they ll charge too much said tom_loker
i ll manage that ar they young in the business and must spect to work cheap said marks as he continued to read
ther three on em easy case cause all you ve got to do is to shoot em or swear they is shot they couldnt of course charge much for that
them other case he said folding the paper will bear puttin off a spell so now let come to the particulars
now mr_haley you saw this yer gal when she landed to be sure plain as i see you and a man helpin on her up the bank said tom_loker
to be sure i did most likely said marks she took in somewhere but where a question
tom_loker what do you say we must cross the river tonight no mistake said tom_loker but there no boat about said marks
the ice is running awfully tom_loker ant it dangerous don no nothing bout that only it got to be done said tom_loker decidedly

well said tom_loker who had just stepped out to the bar to make some inquiries they say the man come with the boat so marks that worthy cast a rueful look at the comfortable quarters he was leaving but slowly rose to obey
after exchanging a few word of further arrangement mr_haley with visible reluctance handed over the fifty dollar to tom_loker and the worthy trio separated for the night
if any of our refined and christian readers object to the society into which this scene introduces them let us beg them to begin and conquer their prejudices in time
i do see said marks besides if she got took in tant no go neither the catching business we beg to remind them is rising to the dignity of a lawful and patriotic profession
if all the broad land between the mississippi and the pacific becomes one great market for body and soul and human property retains the locomotive tendencies of this nineteenth century the trader and catcher may yet be among our aristocracy
while this scene was going on at the tavern sam and andy in a state of high felicitation pursued their way home
sam was in the highest possible feather and expressed his exultation by all sort of supernatural howls and ejaculations by divers odd motions and contortions of his whole system
sometimes he would sit backward with his face to the horse tail and side and then with a whoop and a somerset come right side up in his place again and drawing on a grave face begin to lecture andy in high sounding tone for laughing and playing the fool
anon slapping his side with his arm he would burst forth in peals of laughter that made the old woods ring as they passed
with all these evolutions he contrived to keep the horse up to the top of their speed until between ten and eleven their heels resounded on the gravel at the end of the balcony
mrs mr_shelby flew to the railings is that you sam where are they mas mr_haley a restin at the tavern
he drefful fatigued missis and eliza_harris sam wal she clar cross jordan as a body may say in the land canaan
why sam what do you mean said mrs mr_shelby breathless and almost faint as the possible meaning of these word came over her
lizy done gone over the river into hio as markably as if de lord took her over in a charrit of fire and two hosses
sam vein of piety was always uncommonly fervent in his mistress presence and he made great capital of scriptural figures and images
come up here sam said mr_shelby who had followed on to the verandah and tell your mistress what she wants
come come emily said he passing his arm round her you are cold and all in a shiver you allow yourself to feel too much
wal missis de lord he persarves his own feel too much am not i a woman a mother are we not both responsible to god for this poor girl
my god lay not this sin to our charge what sin emily you see yourself that we have only done what we were obliged to
there an awful feeling of guilt about it though said mrs mr_shelby i cant reason it away here andy you nigger be alive
called sam under the verandah take these yer hosses to der barn dont ye hear mas a callin and sam soon appeared palm leaf in hand at the parlor door
now sam tell us distinctly how the matter was said mr_shelby where is eliza_harris if you know wal mas i saw her with my own eye a crossin on the floatin ice
she crossed most markably it wasnt no less nor a miracle and i saw a man help her up the hio side and then she was lost in the dusk
sam i think this rather apocryphal this miracle crossing on floating ice isnt so easily done said mr_shelby easy couldnt nobody a done it without de lord
mas mr_haley and me and andy we comes up to de little tavern by the river and i rides a leetle
why now said samt was jist dis yer way ahead i so zealous to be a cotchin lizy that i couldnt hold in no way and when i comes by the tavern winder
sure enough there she was right in plain sight and dey diggin on behind wal i loses off my hat and sings out nuff to raise the dead
lizy she hars and she dodges back when mas mr_haley he goes past the door and then i tell ye she clared out de side door she went down de river
down she come to the river and thar was the current running ten foot wide by the shore and overt other side ice a sawin and
course bank mas mr_haley he seed her and yelled out and him and me and andy we took arter a jiggling up and down kinder ast were a great island
she gin sich a screech as i never hearn and thar she was clar overt other side of the current on the ice and then on she went a screeching and a jumpin the ice
we come right behind her and i thought my soul he got her sure enough when went crack wallop cracking chunk and she a boundin like a buck
lord the spring that ar gal got in her ant common i o pinion mrs mr_shelby sat perfectly silent pale with excitement while sam told his story
god be praised she isnt dead she said but where is the poor child now de lord will pervide said sam rolling up his eye piously
as i ve been a sayin dis yer a providence and no mistake as missis has allers been a instructin on us
thar allers instruments ris up to do de lord will now ift hadnt been for me today she a been took a dozen time
warnt it i started off de hosses dis yer mornin and kept em chasin till nigh dinner time and didnt i car
mas mr_haley night five miles out of de road dis evening or else he a come up with lizy as easy as a dog arter a coon
these yer all providences they are a kind of providences that you ll have to be pretty sparing of master sam
i allow no such practices with gentleman on my place said mr_shelby with as much sternness as he could command under the circumstances
now there is no more use in making believe be angry with a negro than with a child both instinctively see the true state of the case through all attempts to affect the contrary and sam was in no wise disheartened by this rebuke though he assumed an air of doleful gravity and stood with the corners of his mouth lowered in most penitential style
mas quite right quite it was ugly on me there no disputin that ar and of course mas and missis wouldnt encourage no such work
i sensible of dat ar but a poor nigger like me mazin tempted to act ugly sometimes when fellers will cut up such shines as dat ar mas mr_haley
he ant no gen man no way anybody been raised as i ve been cant help a seein dat ar
well sam said mrs mr_shelby as you appear to have a proper sense of your errors you may go now and tell aunt_chloe she may get you some of that cold ham that was left of dinner today
you and andy must be hungry missis is a heap too good for us said sam making his bow with alacrity and departing
it will be perceived as has been before intimated that master sam had a native talent that might undoubtedly have raised him to eminence in political life a talent of making capital out of everything that turned up to be invested for his own especial praise and glory and having done up his piety and humility as he trusted to the satisfaction of the parlor he clapped his palm leaf on his head with a sort of rakish free and easy air and proceeded to the dominions of aunt_chloe with the intention of flourishing largely in the kitchen
i ll speechify these yer nigger said sam to himself now i ve got a chance lord i ll reel it off to make em stare
it must be observed that one of sam especial delights had been to ride in attendance on his master to all kind of political gatherings where roosted on some rail fence or perched aloft in some tree he would sit watching the orators with the greatest apparent gusto and then descending among the various brethren of his own color assembled on the same errand he would edify and delight them with the most ludicrous burlesques and imitations all delivered with the most imperturbable earnestness and solemnity and though the auditors immediately about him were generally of his own color it not infrequently happened that they were fringed pretty deeply with those of a fairer complexion who listened laughing and winking to sam great self congratulation
now between sam and aunt_chloe there had existed from ancient time a sort of chronic feud or rather a decided coolness but as sam was meditating something in the provision department as the necessary and obvious foundation of his operations he determined on the present occasion to be eminently conciliatory for he well knew that although missis orders would undoubtedly be followed to the letter yet he should gain a considerable deal by enlisting the spirit also
he therefore appeared before aunt_chloe with a touchingly subdued resigned expression like one who has suffered immeasurable hardships in behalf of a persecuted fellow creature enlarged upon the fact that missis had directed him to come to aunt_chloe for whatever might be wanting to make up the balance in his solids and fluids and thus unequivocally acknowledged her right and supremacy in the cooking department and all thereto pertaining
in fact sam considered oratory as his vocation and never let slip an opportunity of magnifying his office the thing took accordingly
no poor simple virtuous body was ever cajoled by the attentions of an electioneering politician with more ease than aunt_chloe was won over by master sam suavities and if he had been the prodigal son himself he could not have been overwhelmed with more maternal bountifulness and he soon found himself seated happy and glorious over a large tin pan containing a sort of olla podrida of all that had appeared on the table for two or three day past
savory morsels of ham golden blocks of corn cake fragments of pie of every conceivable mathematical figure chicken wings gizzards and drumsticks all appeared in picturesque confusion and sam as monarch of all he surveyed sat with his palm leaf cocked rejoicingly to one side and patronizing andy at his right hand
the kitchen was full of all his compeers who had hurried and crowded in from the various cabins to hear the termination of the day exploits
the story of the day was rehearsed with all kind of ornament and varnishing which might be necessary to heighten its effect for sam like some of our fashionable dilettanti never allowed a story to lose any of its gilding by passing through his hand
roars of laughter attended the narration and were taken up and prolonged by all the smaller fry who were lying in any quantity about on the floor or perched in every corner
in the height of the uproar and laughter sam however preserved an immovable gravity only from time to time rolling his eye up and giving his auditors divers inexpressibly droll glances without departing from the sententious elevation of his oratory
now was sam hour of glory yer see fellow countrymen said sam elevating a turkey leg with energy yer see now what dis
for him as tries to get one our people is as good as tryin to get all yer see the principle de same dat ar clar
and any one these yer drivers that comes smelling round arter any our people why he got me in his way i the feller he got to set in with i the feller for yer all to come to bredren i ll stand up for yer rights i ll fend
why but sam yer telled me only this mornin that you help this yer mas to cotch lizy seems to me yer talk dont hang together said andy
i tell you now andy said sam with awful superiority dont yer be a talkin bout what yer dont know nothing on boy like you andy means well but they cant be spected to collusitate the great principles of action
andy looked rebuked particularly by the hard word collusitate which most of the youngerly members of the company seemed to consider as a settler in the case while sam proceeded
dat ar was conscience andy when i thought of gwine arter lizy i railly spected mas was sot dat way
when i found missis was sot the contrar dat ar was conscience more yet cause fellers allers gets more by stickin to
yer chile up ter for fendin yer all yes all on yer em to the last breath missis side so yer see
yes principles said sam giving an enthusiastic toss to a chicken neck what principles good for if we isnt persistent i wanter know
i persistent either way and sticks up to conscience and holds on to principles thar andy you may have dat ar bone tant picked quite clean
sam audience hanging on his word with open mouth he could not but proceed dis yer matter bout persistence feller nigger said sam with the air of one entering into an abstruse subject
now yer see when a feller stands up for a thing one day and night de contrar de next folks ses and nat rally enough dey ses why he ant persistent hand me dat ar bit corn cake andy
dis yer sistency a thing what ant seed into very clar by most anybody but let look inter it i hope the gen lmen and der fair sex will scuse my usin an or nary sort parison
wal i puts up my larder dis yer side tant no go den cause i dont try dere no more but puts my larder right de contrar side
here i a trying to get top der hay ant i persistent i persistent in wantin to get up which ary side my larder is dont you see all on yer
muttered aunt_chloe who was getting rather restive the merriment of the evening being to her somewhat after the scripture comparison like vinegar upon nitre
it the only thing ye ever was persistent in lord knows yes indeed said sam rising full of supper and glory for a closing effort
yes my feller citizens and lady of de other sex in general i has principles i proud to oon em they perquisite to dese yer time and ter all time
i goes in tot i wouldnt mind if dey burnt me live i walk right up to de stake i would and say here i comes to shed my last blood fur my principles fur my country fur de gen interests of society
i has principles and i sticks to em like forty jest anything that i thinks is principle well said aunt_chloe one
principles will have to be to get to bed some time tonight and not be a keepin everybody up till mornin now every one of you young uns that dont want to be cracked had better be scase mighty sudden
said sam waving his palm leaf with benignity i give yer my blessin go to bed now and be good boy
yer nigger all on yer and with this pathetic benediction the assembly dispersed chapter ix in which it appears that a senator is
the light of the cheerful fire shone on the rug and carpet of a cosey parlor and glittered on the side of the tea cups and well brightened tea pot as senator mrs_bird was drawing off his boots preparatory to inserting his foot in a pair of new handsome slippers which his wife had been working for him while away on his senatorial tour
mrs_bird looking the very picture of delight was superintending the arrangements of the table ever and anon mingling admonitory remarks to a number of frolicsome juveniles who were effervescing in all those modes of untold gambol and mischief that have astonished mother ever since the flood
jim_crow you mustnt climb on that table no no you dont know my dear what a surprise it is to us all to see you here tonight
but a man tom_loker let the door knob alone there a man mary mary dont pull the cat tail poor pussy said she at last when she found a space to say something to her husband
yes yes i thought i just make a run down spend the night and have a little comfort at home
mrs_bird cast a glance at a camphor bottle which stood in the half open closet and appeared to meditate an approach to it but her husband interposed
i tired to death and my head aches no no mary no doctoring a cup of your good hot tea and some of our good home living is what i want
it a tiresome business this legislating and the senator smiled as if he rather liked the idea of considering himself a sacrifice to his country
well said his wife after the business of the tea table was getting rather slack and what have they been doing in the senate
now it was a very unusual thing for gentle little mrs_bird ever to trouble her head with what was going on in the house of the state very wisely considering that she had enough to do to mind her own
well but is it true that they have been passing a law forbidding people to give meat and drink to those poor colored folks that come along
mr mrs_bird therefore opened his eye in surprise and said not very much of importance i heard they were talking of some such law but i didnt think any christian legislature would pass it
why mary you are getting to be a politician all at once no nonsense i wouldnt give a fig for all your politics generally but i think this is something downright cruel and unchristian
there has been a law passed forbidding people to help off the slave that come over from kentucky my dear so much of that thing has been done by these reckless abolitionists that our brethren in kentucky are very strongly excited and it seems necessary and no more than christian and kind that something should be done by our state to quiet the excitement
it dont forbid us to shelter those poor creature a night does it and to give em something comfortable to eat and a few old clothes and send them quietly about their business
i hope my dear no such law has been passed and what is the law why yes my dear that would be aiding and abetting you know
mrs_bird was a timid blushing little woman of about four foot in height and with mild blue eye and a peach blow complexion and the gentlest sweetest voice in the world as for courage a moderate sized cock turkey had been known to put her to rout at the very first gobble and a stout house dog of moderate capacity would bring her into subjection merely by a show of his teeth
her husband and child were her entire world and in these she ruled more by entreaty and persuasion than by command or argument
there was only one thing that was capable of arousing her and that provocation came in on the side of her unusually gentle and sympathetic nature anything in the shape of cruelty would throw her into a passion which was the more alarming and inexplicable in proportion to the general softness of her nature
generally the most indulgent and easy to be entreated of all mother still her boy had a very reverent remembrance of a most vehement chastisement she once bestowed on them because she found them leagued with several graceless boy of the neighborhood stoning a defenceless kitten
mother came at me so that i thought she was crazy and i was whipped and tumbled off to bed without any supper before i could get over wondering what had come about and after that i heard mother crying outside the door which made me feel worse than all the rest
i ll tell you what master bill used to say i was scared that time i ll tell you what he say we boy never stoned another kitten
on the present occasion mrs_bird rose quickly with very red cheeks which quite improved her general appearance and walked up to her husband with quite a resolute air and said in a determined tone now john_bunyan i want to know if you think such a law as that is right and christian
you wont shoot me now mary if i say i do i never could have thought it of you john_bunyan you didnt vote for it
it a shameful wicked abominable law and i ll break it for one the first time i get a chance and i hope i shall have a chance i do
thing have got to a pretty pass if a woman cant give a warm supper and a bed to poor starving creature just because they are slave and have been abused and oppressed all their life poor thing
even so my fair politician you ought to be ashamed john_bunyan poor homeless houseless creature but mary just listen to me
your feeling are all quite right dear and interesting and i love you for them but then dear we mustnt suffer our feeling to run away with our judgment you must consider it a matter of private feeling there
are great public interests involved there is such a state of public agitation rising that we must put aside our private feeling
now john_bunyan i dont know anything about politics but i can read my bible and there i see that i must feed the hungry clothe the naked and comfort the desolate and that bible i mean to follow
but in case where your doing so would involve a great public evil obeying god never brings on public evils
i know it cant it always safest all round to do as he bids us now listen to me mary and i can state to you a very clear argument to show
i put it to you john_bunyan would you now turn away a poor shivering hungry creature from your door because he was a runaway
now if the truth must be told our senator had the misfortune to be a man who had a particularly humane and accessible nature and turning away anybody that was in trouble
never had been his forte and what was worse for him in this particular pinch of the argument was that his wife knew it and of course was making an assault on rather an indefensible point
so he had recourse to the usual means of gaining time for such case made and provided he said ahem and coughed several time took out his pocket handkerchief and began to wipe his glasses
nonsense john_bunyan you can talk all night but you wouldnt do it would you now mrs_bird seeing the defenceless condition of the enemy territory had no more conscience than to push her advantage
turning a woman out of door in a snowstorm for instance or may be you take her up and put her in jail wouldnt you
i should like to see you doing that john_bunyan i really should you would make a great hand at that of course it would be a very painful duty began mr mrs_bird in a moderate tone
duty john_bunyan dont use that word you know it isnt a duty it cant be a duty if folks want to keep their slave from running away let em treat
if i had slave as i hope i never shall have i risk their wanting to run away from me or you either john_bunyan
em well that my doctrine i tell you folks dont run away when they are happy and when they do run poor creature
they suffer enough with cold and hunger and fear without everybody turning against them and law or no law i never will so help me god
there a way you political folks have of coming round and round a plain right thing and you dont believe in it yourselves when it comes to practice
mary mary my dear let me reason with you i hate reasoning john_bunyan especially reasoning on such subjects i know you well enough john_bunyan
at this critical juncture old cudjoe the black man of all work put his head in at the door and wished missis would come into the kitchen and our senator tolerably relieved looked after his little wife with a whimsical mixture of amusement and vexation and seating himself in the arm chair began to read the paper
you dont believe it right any more than i do and you wouldnt do it any sooner than i after a moment his wife voice was heard at the door in a quick earnest tone john_bunyan
he laid down his paper and went into the kitchen and started quite amazed at the sight that presented itself a young and slender woman with garments torn and frozen with one shoe gone and the stocking torn away from the cut and bleeding foot was laid back in a deadly swoon upon two chair
there was the impress of the despised race on her face yet none could help feeling its mournful and pathetic beauty while its stony sharpness its cold fixed deathly aspect struck a solemn chill over him
his wife and their only colored domestic old aunt dinah were busily engaged in restorative measures while old cudjoe had got the boy on his knee and was busy pulling off his shoes and stockings and chafing his little cold foot
sure now if she ant a sight to behold said old dinah compassionately pears liket was the heat that made her faint
she was tol able peart when she cum in and asked if she couldnt warm herself here a spell and i was just a askin her where she cum from and she fainted right down
john_bunyan i do wish you come here a moment he drew his breath short and stood in silence never done much hard work guess by the looks of her hand
poor creature said mrs_bird compassionately as the woman slowly unclosed her large dark eye and looked vacantly at her
suddenly an expression of agony crossed her face and she sprang up saying my harry have they got him
the boy at this jumped from cudjoe knee and running to her side put up his arm he here
he here she exclaimed ma am said she wildly to mrs_bird do protect us dont let them get him
god bless you said the woman covering her face and sobbing while the little boy seeing her crying tried to get into her lap
with many gentle and womanly offices which none knew better how to render than mrs_bird the poor woman was in time rendered more calm
a temporary bed was provided for her on the settle near the fire and after a short time she fell into a heavy slumber with the child who seemed no less weary soundly sleeping on her arm
for the mother resisted with nervous anxiety the kindest attempts to take him from her and even in sleep her arm encircled him with an unrelaxing clasp as if she could not even then be beguiled of her vigilant hold
mr and mrs_bird had gone back to the parlor where strange as it may appear no reference was made on either side to the preceding conversation but mrs_bird busied herself with her knitting work and mr mrs_bird pretended to be reading the paper
nobody shall hurt you here poor woman said mrs_bird encouragingly you are safe dont be afraid i wonder who and what she is said mr mrs_bird at last as he laid it down
when she wakes up and feels a little rested we will see said mrs_bird i say wife said mr mrs_bird after musing in silence over his newspaper
well dear she couldnt wear one of your gowns could she by any letting down or such matter she seems to be rather larger than you are
a quite perceptible smile glimmered on mrs_bird face as she answered we ll see another pause and mr mrs_bird again broke out i say wife
why there that old bombazin cloak that you keep on purpose to put over me when i take my afternoon nap you might as well give her that she needs clothes
well what now at this instant dinah looked in to say that the woman was awake and wanted to see missis
mr and mrs_bird went into the kitchen followed by the two eldest boy the smaller fry having by this time been safely disposed of in bed
the woman was now sitting up on the settle by the fire she was looking steadily into the blaze with a calm heart broken expression very different from her former agitated wildness
did you want me said mrs_bird in gentle tone i hope you feel better now poor woman
a long drawn shivering sigh was the only answer but she lifted her dark eye and fixed them on her with such a forlorn and imploring expression that the tear came into the little woman eye
you neednt be afraid of anything we are friend here poor woman tell me where you came from and what you want said she
i came from kentucky said the woman when said mr mrs_bird taking up the interogatory tonight how did you come
i crossed on the ice crossed on the ice said every one present yes said the woman slowly i did
law missis said cudjoe the ice is all in broken up blocks a swinging and a tetering up and down in the water
god helping me i crossed on the ice for they were behind me right behind and there was no other way i know it was i know it said she wildly but i did it
i wouldnt have thought i could i didnt think i should get over but i didnt care i could but die if i didnt
the lord helped me nobody knows how much the lord can help em till they try said the woman with a flashing eye
were you a slave said mr mrs_bird yes sir i belonged to a man in kentucky was he unkind to you
no sir he was a good master and was your mistress unkind to you no sir no my mistress was always good to me
the woman looked up at mrs_bird with a keen scrutinizing glance and it did not escape her that she was dressed in deep mourning
what could induce you to leave a good home then and run away and go through such dangers
the question was unexpected and it was thrust on a new wound for it was only a month since a darling child of the family had been laid in the grave
mr mrs_bird turned around and walked to the window and mrs_bird burst into tear but recovering her voice she said why do you ask that
ma am she said suddenly have you ever lost a child i have lost a little one then you will feel for me
i have lost two one after another left em buried there when i came away and i had only this one left
he was my comfort and pride day and night and ma am they were going to take him away from me to sell
him sell him down south ma am to go all alone a baby that had never been away from his mother in his life
i knew i never should be good for anything if they did and when i knew the paper the paper were signed and he was sold i took him and came off in the night and they chased me the man that bought him and some of mas s
i never slept a night without him he was all i had i couldnt stand it ma am folks and they were coming down right behind me and i heard em
i jumped right on to the ice and how i got across i dont know but first i knew a man was helping me up the bank
she had gone to a place where tear are dry but every one around her was in some way characteristic of themselves showing signs of hearty sympathy
the two little boy after a desperate rummaging in their pocket in search of those pocket handkerchiefs which mother know are never to be found there had thrown themselves disconsolately into the skirts of their mother gown where they were sobbing and wiping their eye and noses to their heart content mrs
the woman did not sob nor weep mrs_bird had her face fairly hidden in her pocket handkerchief and old dinah with tear streaming down her black honest face was ejaculating lord have mercy on us
with all the fervor of a camp meeting while old cudjoe rubbing his eye very hard with his cuffs and making a most uncommon variety of wry face occasionally responded in the same key with great fervor
our senator was a statesman and of course could not be expected to cry like other mortals and so he turned his back to the company and looked out of the window and seemed particularly busy in clearing his throat and wiping his spectacle glasses occasionally blowing his nose in a manner that was calculated to excite suspicion had any one been in a state to observe critically
he suddenly exclaimed gulping down very resolutely some kind of rising in his throat and turning suddenly round upon the woman
because he was a kind master i ll say that of him any way and my mistress was kind but they couldnt help themselves
how came you to tell me you had a kind master they were owing money and there was some way
i cant tell how that a man had a hold on them and they were obliged to give him his will
i listened and heard him telling mistress that and she begging and pleading for me and he told her he couldnt help himself and that the paper were all drawn and
i knewt was no use of my trying to live if they did it fort pears like this child is all i have
then it was i took him and left my home and came away have you no husband yes but he belongs to another man
his master is real hard to him and wont let him come to see me hardly ever and he grown harder and harder upon us and he threatens to sell him down south it like i ll never see him again
the quiet tone in which the woman pronounced these word might have led a superficial observer to think that she was entirely apathetic but there was a calm settled depth of anguish in her large dark eye that spoke of something far otherwise
and where do you mean to go my poor woman said mrs_bird to canada if i only knew where that was
is it very far off is canada said she looking up with a simple confiding air to mrs_bird face
poor thing said mrs_bird involuntarily ist a very great way off think said the woman earnestly
much further than you think poor child said mrs_bird but we will try to think what can be done for you
here dinah make her up a bed in your own room close by the kitchen and i ll think what to do for her in the morning
meanwhile never fear poor woman put your trust in god he will protect you mrs_bird and her husband reentered the parlor
she sat down in her little rocking chair before the fire swaying thoughtfully to and fro mr mrs_bird strode up and down the room grumbling to himself pish
at length striding up to his wife he said i say wife she ll have to get away from here this very night
that fellow will be down on the scent bright and early tomorrow morning ift was only the woman she could lie quiet till it was over but that little chap cant be kept still by a troop of horse and foot i ll warrant me he ll bring it all out popping his head out of some window or door
pshaw confounded awkward business a pretty kettle of fish it would be for me too to be caught with them both here just now
well i know pretty well where to said the senator beginning to put on his boots with a reflective air and stopping when his leg was half in he embraced his knee with both hand and seemed to go off in deep meditation
it a confounded awkward ugly business said he at last beginning to tug at his boot straps again and that a fact
after one boot was fairly on the senator sat with the other in his hand profoundly studying the figure of the carpet
no they ll have to be got off tonight tonight how is it possible where to it will have to be done though for aught
i see hang it all and he drew the other boot anxiously on and looked out of the window now little mrs_bird was a discreet woman a woman who never in her life said i told you so
and on the present occasion though pretty well aware of the shape her husband meditations were taking she very prudently forbore to meddle with them only sat very quietly in her chair and looked quite ready to hear her liege lord intentions when he should think proper to utter them
you see he said there my old client van trompe has come over from kentucky and set all his slave free and he has bought a place seven miles up the creek here back in the woods where nobody goes unless they go on purpose and it a place that isnt found in a hurry
there she be safe enough but the plague of the thing is nobody could drive a carriage there tonight but me
the creek has to be crossed twice and the second crossing is quite dangerous unless one knows it as i do
why not cudjoe is an excellent driver ay ay but here it is i have crossed it a hundred time on horseback and know exactly the turns to take
cudjoe must put in the horse as quietly as may be about twelve clock and i ll take her over and then to give color to the matter he must carry me on to the next tavern to take the stage for columbus that comes by about three or four and so it will look as if i had had the carriage only for that
but i thinking i shall feel rather cheap there after all that been said and done but hang it i cant help it
your heart is better than your head in this case john_bunyan said the wife laying her little white hand on his
and so you see there no help for it i shall get into business bright and early in the morning
and the little woman looked so handsome with the tear sparkling in her eye that the senator thought he must be a decidedly clever fellow to get such a pretty creature into such a passionate admiration of him and so what could he do but walk off soberly to see about the carriage
could i ever have loved you had i not known you better than you know yourself at the door however he stopped a moment and then coming back he said with some hesitation
mary i dont know how you feel about it but there that drawer full of thing of of poor little henry so saying he turned quickly on his heel and shut the door after him
his wife opened the little bed room door adjoining her room and taking the candle set it down on the top of a bureau there then from a small recess she took a key and put it thoughtfully in the lock of a drawer and made a sudden pause while two boy who boy like had followed close on her heels stood looking with silent significant glances at their mother
mother that reads this has there never been in your house a drawer or a closet the opening of which has been to you like the opening again of a little grave
there were little coats of many a form and pattern piles of aprons and rows of small stockings and even a pair of little shoes worn and rubbed at the toes were peeping from the folds of a paper
and oh ah happy mother that you are if it has not been so mrs_bird slowly opened the drawer there was a toy horse and wagon a top a ball memorials gathered with many a tear and many a heart break
she sat down by the drawer and leaning her head on her hand over it wept till the tear fell through her fingers into the drawer then suddenly raising her head she began with nervous haste selecting the plainest and most substantial articles and gathering them into a bundle
my dear boy she said softly and earnestly if our dear loving little henry looks down from heaven he would be glad to have us do this
i could not find it in my heart to give them away to any common person to anybody that was happy but i give them to a mother more heart broken and sorrowful than i am and i hope god will send his blessings with them
there are in this world blessed soul whose sorrows all spring up into joys for others whose earthly hopes laid in the grave with many tear are the seed from which spring healing flowers and balm for the desolate and the distressed
among such was the delicate woman who sits there by the lamp dropping slow tear while she prepares the memorials of her own lost one for the outcast wanderer
after a while mrs_bird opened a wardrobe and taking from thence a plain serviceable dress or two she sat down busily to her work table and with needle scissors and thimble at hand quietly commenced the letting down process which her husband had recommended and continued busily at it till the old clock in the corner struck twelve and she heard the low rattling of wheels at the door
mary said her husband coming in with his overcoat in his hand you must wake her up now we must be off
mamma said one of the boy gently touching her arm you going to give away those thing
mrs_bird hastily deposited the various articles she had collected in a small plain trunk and locking it desired her husband to see it in the carriage and then proceeded to call the woman
soon arrayed in a cloak bonnet and shawl that had belonged to her benefactress she appeared at the door with her child in her arm
eliza_harris leaned out of the carriage and put out her hand a hand as soft and beautiful as was given in return
mr mrs_bird hurried her into the carriage and mrs_bird pressed on after her to the carriage steps she fixed her large dark eye full of earnest meaning on mrs_bird face and seemed going to speak
her lips moved she tried once or twice but there was no sound and pointing upward with a look never to be forgotten she fell back in the seat and covered her face
what a situation now for a patriotic senator that had been all the week before spurring up the legislature of his native state to pass more stringent resolutions against escaping fugitives their harborers and abettors
our good senator in his native state had not been exceeded by any of his brethren at washington in the sort of eloquence which has won for them immortal renown
how sublimely he had sat with his hand in his pocket and scouted all sentimental weakness of those who would put the welfare of a few miserable fugitives before great state interests
the door was shut and the carriage drove on he was as bold as a lion about it and mightily convinced not only himself but everybody that heard
him but then his idea of a fugitive was only an idea of the letter that spell the word or at the most the image of a little newspaper picture of a man with a stick and bundle with ran away from the subscriber under it
the magic of the real presence of distress the imploring human eye the frail trembling human hand the despairing appeal of helpless agony these he had never tried
he had never thought that a fugitive might be a hapless mother a defenceless child like that one which was now wearing his lost boy little well known cap and so as our poor senator was not stone or
steel as he was a man and a downright noble hearted one too he was as everybody must see in a sad case for his patriotism
and you need not exult over him good brother of the southern state for we have some inklings that many of you under similar circumstances would not do much better
we have reason to know in kentucky as in mississippi are noble and generous heart to whom never was tale of suffering told in vain
is it fair for you to expect of us services which your own brave honorable heart would not allow you to render were you in our place
be that as it may if our good senator was a political sinner he was in a fair way to expiate it by his night penance
there had been a long continuous period of rainy weather and the soft rich earth of ohio as every one knows is admirably suited to the manufacture of mud and the road was an ohio railroad of the good old time
and pray what sort of a road may that be says some eastern traveller who has been accustomed to connect no ideas with a railroad but those of smoothness or speed
know then innocent eastern friend that in benighted regions of the west where the mud is of unfathomable and sublime depth road are made of round rough logs arranged transversely side by side and coated over in their pristine freshness with earth turf and whatsoever may come to hand and then the rejoicing native calleth
in process of time the rains wash off all the turf and grass aforesaid move the logs hither and thither in picturesque positions up down and crosswise with divers chasms and ruts of black mud intervening
over such a road as this our senator went stumbling along making moral reflections as continuously as under the circumstances could be expected the carriage proceeding along much as follows bump
down in the mud the senator woman and child reversing their positions so suddenly as to come without any very accurate adjustment against the window of the down hill side
ah good brother it a road and straightway essayeth to ride thereupon bump bump slush carriage sticks fast while cudjoe on the outside is heard making a great muster among the horse
after various ineffectual pullings and twitchings just as the senator is losing all patience the carriage suddenly rights itself with a bounce two front wheels go down into another abyss and senator woman and child all tumble promiscuously on to the front seat senator hat is jammed over his eye and nose quite unceremoniously and he considers himself fairly extinguished child cries and cudjoe on the outside delivers animated addresses to the horse who are kicking and floundering and straining under repeated cracks of the whip
carriage springs up with another bounce down go the hind wheels senator woman and child fly over on to the back seat his elbows encountering her bonnet and both her foot being jammed into his hat which flies off in the concussion
after a few moment the slough is passed and the horse stop panting the senator finds his hat the woman straightens her bonnet and hushes her child and they brace themselves for what is yet to come
intermingled just by way of variety with divers side plunges and compound shakes and they begin to flatter themselves that they are not so badly off after all
at last with a square plunge which puts all on to their foot and then down into their seats with incredible quickness the carriage stops and after much outside commotion cudjoe appears at the door
for a while only the continuous bump bump please sir it powerful bad spot this yer i dont know how we to get clar out
i a thinkin we ll have to be a gettin rails the senator despairingly steps out picking gingerly for some firm foothold down goes one foot
an immeasurable depth he tries to pull it up loses his balance and tumbles over into the mud and is fished out in a very despairing condition by cudjoe
western travellers who have beguiled the midnight hour in the interesting process of pulling down rail fences to pry their carriages out of mud holes will have a respectful and mournful sympathy with our unfortunate hero
but we forbear out of sympathy to our readers bones we beg them to drop a silent tear and pass on
it was full late in the night when the carriage emerged dripping and bespattered out of the creek and stood at the door of a large farmhouse
he was a great tall bristling orson of a fellow full six foot and some inches in his stockings and arrayed in a red flannel hunting shirt
a very heavy mat of sandy hair in a decidedly tousled condition and a beard of some day growth gave the worthy man an appearance to say the least not particularly prepossessing
he stood for a few minutes holding the candle aloft and blinking on our travellers with a dismal and mystified expression that was truly ludicrous
it cost some effort of our senator to induce him to comprehend the case fully and while he is doing his best at that we shall give him a little introduction to our readers
it took no inconsiderable perseverance to arouse the inmates but at last the respectable proprietor appeared and undid the door honest old john_bunyan van trompe was once quite a considerable land owner and slave owner in the state of kentucky
having nothing of the bear about him but the skin and being gifted by nature with a great honest just heart quite equal to his gigantic frame he had been for some year witnessing with repressed uneasiness the workings of a system equally bad for oppressor and oppressed
at last one day john_bunyan great heart had swelled altogether too big to wear his bonds any longer so he just took his pocket book out of his desk and went over into ohio and bought a quarter of a township of good rich land made out free paper for all his people man woman and child packed them up in wagons and sent them off to settle down and then honest john_bunyan turned his face up the creek and sat quietly down on a snug retired farm to enjoy his conscience and his reflections
are you the man that will shelter a poor woman and child from slave catchers said the senator explicitly
if there anybody comes said the good man stretching his tall muscular form upward why here i ready for him and i ve got seven sons each six foot high and they ll be ready for em
i rather think i am said honest john_bunyan with some considerable emphasis i thought so said the senator give our respects to em said john_bunyan tell em
it no matter how soon they call make no kinder difference to us said john_bunyan running his fingers through the shock of hair that thatched his head and bursting out into a great laugh
weary jaded and spiritless eliza_harris dragged herself up to the door with her child lying in a heavy sleep on her arm
the rough man held the candle to her face and uttering a kind of compassionate grunt opened the door of a small bed room adjoining to the large kitchen where they were standing and motioned her to go in
he took down a candle and lighting it set it upon the table and then addressed himself to eliza_harris now i say gal you neednt be a bit afeard let who will come here
i up to all that sort thing said he pointing to two or three goodly rifles over the mantel piece and most people that know me know thatt wouldnt be healthy to try to get anybody out
so now you jist go to sleep now as quiet as if yer mother was a rockin ye said he as he shut the door
o my house when i agin it why this is an uncommon handsome un he said to the senator
ah well handsome uns has the greatest cause to run sometimes if they has any kind feelin such as decent woman should
i know all about that the senator in a few word briefly explained eliza_harris history ou aw now i want to know said the good man pitifully sho now sho
hunted down now like a deer hunted down jest for havin natural feelin and doin what no kind mother could help a doin
i tell ye what these yer thing make me come the nighest to swearin now most anything said honest john_bunyan as he wiped his eye with the back of a great freckled yellow hand
i tell yer what stranger it was year and year before i jine the church cause the ministers round in our part used to preach that the bible went in for these ere cuttings
up and i couldnt be up to em with their greek and hebrew and so i took up agin em bible and all
i never jined the church till i found a minister that was up to em all in greek and all that and he said right the contrary and then i took right hold and jined the church i did now fact said john_bunyan who had been all this time uncorking some very frisky bottled cider which at this juncture he presented
ye better jest put up here now till daylight said he heartily and i ll call up the old woman and have a bed got ready for you in no time
that natur now poor crittur thank you my good friend said the senator i must be along to take the night stage for columbus
ah well then if you must i ll go a piece with you and show you a cross road that will take you there better than the road you came on
john_bunyan equipped himself and with a lantern in hand was soon seen guiding the senator carriage towards a road that ran down in a hollow back of his dwelling
that road mighty bad when they parted the senator put into his hand a ten dollar bill it for her he said briefly
ay ay said john_bunyan with equal conciseness they shook hand and parted chapter the property is carried off the february morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of uncle tom_loker cabin
the little table stood out before the fire covered with an ironing cloth a coarse but clean shirt or two fresh from the iron hung on the back of a chair by the fire and aunt_chloe had another spread out before her on the table
carefully she rubbed and ironed every fold and every hem with the most scrupulous exactness every now and then raising her hand to her face to wipe off the tear that were coursing down her cheeks
it looked on downcast face the images of mournful heart tom_loker sat by with his testament open on his knee and his head leaning upon his
hand but neither spoke it was yet early and the child lay all asleep together in their little rude trundle bed tom_loker who had to the full the gentle domestic heart which woe for them
has been a peculiar characteristic of his unhappy race got up and walked silently to look at his child it the last time he said
aunt_chloe did not answer only rubbed away over and over on the coarse shirt already as smooth as hand could make it and finally setting her iron suddenly down with a despairing plunge she sat down to the table and lifted up her voice and wept
pose we must be resigned but oh lord how ken i if i know anything whar you goin or how they sarve you
missis says she ll try and deem ye in a year or two but lor nobody never comes up that goes down thar
they kills em i ve hearn em tell how dey work em up on dem ar plantation there ll be the same god there aunt_chloe that there is here

it me that sold and going down and not you nur the chil en here you re safe what comes will come only on me and the lord he ll help me i know he will
ah brave manly heart smothering thine own sorrow to comfort thy beloved one tom_loker spoke with a thick utterance and with a bitter choking in his
let think on our marcies he added tremulously as if he was quite sure he needed to think on them very hard indeed
throat but he spoke brave and strong marcies said aunt_chloe dont see no marcy int tant right tant right it should be so
mas never ought ter left it so that ye could be took for his debts ye ve arnt him all he gets for ye twice over
he owed ye yer freedom and ought ter gint to yer year ago mebbe he cant help himself now but i feel it wrong

i cant jest make out whart is but thar wrong somewhar i clar that yer ought ter look up to the lord above
he above all thar dont a sparrow fall without him it dont seem to comfort me but i spect it orter said aunt_chloe
but dar no use talkin i ll jes wet up de corn cake and get ye one good breakfast cause nobody knows when you ll get another
in order to appreciate the sufferings of the negroes sold south it must be remembered that all the instinctive affections of that race are peculiarly strong
add to this all the terrors with which ignorance invests the unknown and add to this again that selling to the south is set before the negro from childhood as the last severity of punishment
their local attachments are very abiding they are not naturally daring and enterprising but home loving and affectionate the threat that terrifies more than whipping or torture of any kind is the threat of being sent down river
we have ourselves heard this feeling expressed by them and seen the unaffected horror with which they will sit in their gossipping hour and tell frightful stories of that down river which to them is that undiscovered country from whose bourn no traveller returns
a missionary figure among the fugitives in canada told us that many of the fugitives confessed themselves to have escaped from comparatively kind master and that they were induced to brave the perils of escape in almost every case by the desperate horror with which they regarded being sold south a doom which was hanging either over themselves or their husband their wife or child
this nerves the african naturally patient timid and unenterprising with heroic courage and leads him to suffer hunger cold pain the perils of the wilderness and the more dread penalties of recapture
the simple morning meal now smoked on the table for mrs mr_shelby had excused aunt_chloe attendance at the great house that morning
the poor soul had expended all her little energies on this farewell feast had killed and dressed her choicest chicken and prepared her corn cake with scrupulous exactness just to her husband taste and brought out certain mysterious jars on the mantel piece some preserves that were never produced except on extreme occasions
a slightly inaccurate quotation from hamlet act iii scene i lines lor pete said mose triumphantly hant we got a buster of a breakfast
at the same time catching at a fragment of the chicken aunt_chloe gave him a sudden box on the ear
thar now crowing over the last breakfast yer poor daddy gwine to have to home aunt_chloe said tom_loker gently
wal i cant help it said aunt_chloe hiding her face in her apron i so tossed about it it makes me act ugly
the boy stood quite still looking first at their father and then at their mother while the baby climbing up her clothes began an imperious commanding cry
thar said aunt_chloe wiping her eye and taking up the baby now i done i hope now do eat something
the boy needed no second invitation and went in with great zeal for the eatables and it was well they did so as otherwise there would have been very little performed to any purpose by the party
this yer my nicest chicken thar boy ye shall have some poor critturs yer mammy been cross to yer
now said aunt_chloe bustling about after breakfast i must put up yer clothes jest like as not he ll take em all away
wal now yer flannels for rhumatis is in this corner so be careful cause there wont nobody make ye no more
i know thar way mean as dirt they is then here yer old shirts and these yer is new one i toed off these yer stockings last night and put de ball in em to mend with
but lor who ll ever mend for ye and aunt_chloe again overcome laid her head on the box side and sobbed
to think ont no crittur to do for ye sick or well i dont railly think i ought ter be good now
the boy having eaten everything there was on the breakfast table began now to take some thought of the case and seeing their mother crying and their father looking very sad began to whimper and put their hand to their eye
uncle tom_loker had the baby on his knee and was letting her enjoy herself to the utmost extent scratching his face and pulling his hair and occasionally breaking out into clamorous explosions of delight evidently arising out of her own internal reflections
ye ll live to see yer husband sold or mebbe be sold yerself and these yer boy they to be sold i pose too jest like as not when dey gets good for somethin ant no use in nigger havin nothing
ay crow away poor crittur said aunt_chloe ye ll have to come to it too here one of the boy called out thar missis a comin in
she cant do no good what she coming for said aunt_chloe mrs mr_shelby entered aunt_chloe set a chair for her in a manner decidedly gruff and crusty
tom_loker she said i come to and stopping suddenly and regarding the silent group she sat down in the chair and covering her face with her handkerchief began to sob
lor now missis dont dont said aunt_chloe bursting out in her turn and for a few moment they all wept in company
and in those tear they all shed together the high and the lowly melted away all the heart burnings and anger of the oppressed
o ye who visit the distressed do ye know that everything your money can buy given with a cold averted face is not worth one honest tear shed in real sympathy
she did not seem to notice either the action or the manner she looked pale and anxious my good fellow said mrs mr_shelby i cant give you anything to do you any good
but i tell you solemnly and before god that i will keep trace of you and bring you back as soon as i can command the money and till then trust in god
if i give you money it will only be taken from you here the boy called out that mas mr_haley was coming and then an unceremonious kick pushed open the door
mr_haley stood there in very ill humor having ridden hard the night before and being not at all pacified by his ill success in recapturing his prey
come said he ye nigger ye ready servant ma am said he taking off his hat as he saw mrs mr_shelby
aunt_chloe shut and corded the box and getting up looked gruffly on the trader her tear seeming suddenly turned to sparks of fire
his wife took the baby in her arm to go with him to the wagon and the child still crying trailed on behind
mrs mr_shelby walking up to the trader detained him for a few moment talking with him in an earnest manner and while she was thus talking the whole family party proceeded to a wagon that stood ready harnessed at the door
a crowd of all the old and young hand on the place stood gathered around it to bid farewell to their old associate
tom_loker had been looked up to both as a head servant and a christian teacher by all the place and there was much honest sympathy and grief about him particularly among the woman
why aunt_chloe you bar it better we do said one of the woman who had been weeping freely noticing the gloomy calmness with which aunt_chloe stood by the wagon
tom_loker rose up meekly to follow his new master and raised up his heavy box on his shoulder i done my tear
she said looking grimly at the trader who was coming up i does not feel to cry fore dat ar old limb no how
get in said mr_haley to tom_loker as he strode through the crowd of servant who looked at him with lowering brows
tom_loker got in and mr_haley drawing out from under the wagon seat a heavy pair of shackles made them fast around each ankle
a smothered groan of indignation ran through the whole circle and mrs mr_shelby spoke from the verandah mr_haley i assure you that precaution is entirely unnecessary
don know ma am i ve lost one five hundred dollar from this yer place and i cant afford to run no more risks
what else could she spect on him said aunt_chloe indignantly while the two boy who now seemed to comprehend at once their father destiny clung to her gown sobbing and groaning vehemently
george_harris had gone to spend two or three day with a companion on a neighboring estate and having departed early in the morning before tom_loker misfortune had been made public had left without hearing of it
i sorry said tom_loker that mas george_harris happened to be away give my love to mas george_harris he said earnestly
mr_haley whipped up the horse and with a steady mournful look fixed to the last on the old place tom_loker was whirled away
he had sold tom_loker under the spur of a driving necessity to get out of the power of a man whom he dreaded and his first feeling after the consummation of the bargain had been that of relief
mr_shelby at this time was not at home but his wife expostulations awoke his half slumbering regrets and tom_loker manly disinterestedness increased the unpleasantness of his feeling
everybody did it and that some did it without even the excuse of necessity he could not satisfy his own feeling and that he might not witness the unpleasant scenes of the consummation he had gone on a short business tour up the country hoping that all would be over before he returned
tom_loker and mr_haley rattled on along the dusty road whirling past every old familiar spot until the bounds of the estate were fairly passed and they found themselves out on the open pike
after they had ridden about a mile mr_haley suddenly drew up at the door of a blacksmith shop when taking out with him a pair of handcuffs he stepped into the shop to have a little alteration in them
it was in vain that he said to himself that he had a right to do it that these yer a little too small for his build said mr_haley showing the fetters and pointing out to tom_loker
lor now if thar ant mr_shelby tom_loker he hant sold him now said the smith yes he has said mr_haley
now ye dont well reely said the smith who a thought it why ye neednt go to fetterin him up this yer way
he the faithfullest best crittur yes yes said mr_haley but your good fellers are just the critturs to want ter run off
them stupid one as doesnt care whar they go and shifless drunken one as dont care for nothing they ll stick by and like as not be rather pleased to be toted round but these yer prime fellers they hates it like sin
no way but to fetter em got legs they ll use em no mistake well said the smith feeling among his tools them plantation down thar stranger
wal yes tol able fast ther dying is what with the climating and one thing and another they dies so as to keep the market up pretty brisk said mr_haley
wal now a feller cant help thinkin it a mighty pity to have a nice quiet likely feller as good un as tom_loker is go down to be fairly ground up on one of them ar sugar plantation
ant jest the place a kentuck nigger wants to go to they dies thar tol able fast dont they
i ll get him in house servant in some good old family and then if he stands the fever and climating he ll have a berth good as any nigger ought ter ask for
wal he got a fa chance i promised to do well by him he leaves his wife and chil en up here pose
yes but he ll get another thar lord thar woman enough everywhar said mr_haley tom_loker was sitting very mournfully on the outside of the shop while this conversation was going on
suddenly he heard the quick short click of a horse hoof behind him and before he could fairly awake from his surprise young master george_harris sprang into the wagon threw his arm tumultuously round his neck and was sobbing and scolding with energy
i declare it real mean i dont care what they say any of em it a nasty mean shame if i was a man they shouldnt do
it they should not so said george_harris with a kind of subdued howl mas george_harris this does me good said tom_loker
i couldnt bar to go off without seein ye it does me real good ye cant tell here tom_loker made some movement of his foot and george_harris eye fell on the fetters

i do it and she advised me just to make a hole in it and put a string through so you could hang it round your neck and keep it out of sight else this mean scamp would take it away
but you shall take it said george_harris look here i told aunt_chloe i tell ye tom_loker i want to blow him up

i always was proud of it before and george_harris sat very straight on his horse and looked round with an air as if he expected the state would be impressed with his opinion
i ashamed this day that i a kentuckian well good by uncle tom_loker keep a stiff upper lip said george_harris
good by mas george_harris said tom_loker looking fondly and admiringly at him god almighty bless you ah kentucky hant got many like you
away he went and tom_loker looked till the clatter of his horse heels died away the last sound or sight of his home
he said in the fulness of his heart as the frank boyish face was lost to his view but over his heart there seemed to be a warm spot where those young hand had placed that precious dollar
now i tell ye what tom_loker said mr_haley as he came up to the wagon and threw in the handcuffs i mean to start fa with ye as i gen ally do with my nigger and i ll tell ye now to begin with
tom_loker put up his hand and held it close to his heart you treat me fa and i ll treat you fa r
now ye see you better jest settle down comfortable and not be tryin no tricks because nigger tricks of all sort i up to and it no use
if nigger is quiet and dont try to get off they has good time with me and if they dont why it thar fault and not mine
i ant never hard on my nigger calculates to do the best for em i can tom_loker assured mr_haley that he had no present intentions of running off
in fact the exhortation seemed rather a superfluous one to a man with a great pair of iron fetters on his foot
but mr_haley had got in the habit of commencing his relations with his stock with little exhortations of this nature calculated as he deemed to inspire cheerfulness and confidence and prevent the necessity of any unpleasant scenes
and here for the present we take our leave of tom_loker to pursue the fortunes of other characters in our story
it was late in a drizzly afternoon that a traveler alighted at the door of a small country hotel in the village of in kentucky
in the barroom he found assembled quite a miscellaneous company whom stress of weather had driven to harbor and the place presented the usual scenery of such reunions
great tall raw boned kentuckians attired in hunting shirts and trailing their loose joints over a vast extent of territory with the easy lounge peculiar to the race rifles stacked away in the corner shot pouches game bags hunting dog and little negroes all rolled together in the corners were the characteristic features in the picture
at each end of the fireplace sat a long legged gentleman with his chair tipped back his hat on his head and the heels of his muddy boots reposing sublimely on the mantel piece a position we will inform our readers decidedly favorable to the turn of reflection incident to western taverns where travellers exhibit a decided preference for this particular mode of elevating their understandings
mine host who stood behind the bar like most of his country man was great of stature good natured and loose jointed with an enormous shock of hair on his head and a great tall hat on the top of that
in fact everybody in the room bore on his head this characteristic emblem of man sovereignty whether it were felt hat palm leaf greasy beaver or fine new chapeau there it reposed with true republican independence
chapter xi in which property gets into an improper state of mind in truth it appeared to be the characteristic mark of every individual
some wore them tipped rakishly to one side these were your man of humor jolly free and easy dog some had them jammed independently down over their noses these were your hard characters thorough man who when they wore their hats wanted to wear them and to wear them just as they had a mind to there were those who had them set far over back wide awake man who wanted a clear prospect while careless man who did not know or care how their hats sat had them shaking about in all directions
divers negroes in very free and easy pantaloons and with no redundancy in the shirt line were scuttling about hither and thither without bringing to pass any very particular results except expressing a generic willingness to turn over everything in creation generally for the benefit of mas and his guests
add to this picture a jolly crackling rollicking fire going rejoicingly up a great wide chimney the outer door and every window being set wide open and the calico window curtain flopping and snapping in a good stiff breeze of damp raw
the various hats in fact were quite a shakespearean study air and you have an idea of the jollities of a kentucky tavern
his father were mighty hunters man who lived in the woods and slept under the free open heavens with the stars to hold their candles and their descendant to this day always acts as if the house were his camp wears
his hat at all hour tumbles himself about and puts his heels on the tops of chair or mantelpieces just as his father rolled on the green sward and put his upon trees and logs keeps all the window and door open winter and summer that he may get air enough for his great lungs calls everybody stranger with nonchalant bonhommie and is altogether the frankest easiest most jovial creature living
your kentuckian of the present day is a good illustration of the doctrine of transmitted instincts and peculiarities into such an assembly of the free and easy our traveller entered
he was a short thick set man carefully dressed with a round good natured countenance and something rather fussy and particular in his appearance
he was very careful of his valise and umbrella bringing them in with his own hand and resisting pertinaciously all offers from the various servant to relieve him of them
he looked round the barroom with rather an anxious air and retreating with his valuables to the warmest corner disposed them under his chair sat down and looked rather apprehensively up at the worthy whose heels illustrated the end of the mantel piece who was spitting from right to left with a courage and energy rather alarming to gentleman of weak nerves and particular habits
i say stranger how are ye said the aforesaid gentleman firing an honorary salute of tobacco juice in the direction of the new arrival
well i reckon was the reply of the other as he dodged with some alarm the threatening honor any news said the respondent taking out a strip of tobacco and a large hunting knife from his pocket
not that i know of said the man chaw said the first speaker handing the old gentleman a bit of his tobacco with a decidedly brotherly air
dont eh said the other easily and stowing away the morsel in his own mouth in order to keep up the supply of tobacco juice for the general benefit of society
the old gentleman uniformly gave a little start whenever his long sided brother fired in his direction and this being observed by his companion he very good naturedly turned his artillery to another quarter and proceeded to storm one of the fire irons with a degree of military talent fully sufficient to take a city
no thank ye it dont agree with me said the little man edging off what that said the old gentleman observing some of the company formed in a group around a large handbill
mr_wilson for that was the old gentleman name rose up and after carefully adjusting his valise and umbrella proceeded deliberately to take out his spectacles and fix them on his nose and this operation being performed read as follows ran away from the subscriber my mulatto boy george_harris
said george_harris six foot in height a very light mulatto brown curly hair is very intelligent speaks handsomely can read and write will probably try to pass for a white man is deeply scarred on his back and shoulders has been branded in his right hand with the letter
i will give four hundred dollar for him alive and the same sum for satisfactory proof that he has been killed
nigger advertised said one of the company briefly the old gentleman read this advertisement from end to end in a low voice as if he were studying it
the long legged veteran who had been besieging the fire iron as before related now took down his cumbrous length and rearing aloft his tall form walked up to the advertisement and very deliberately spit a full discharge of tobacco juice on it
there my mind upon that said he briefly and sat down again why now stranger what that for said mine host
i do it all the same to the writer of that ar paper if he was here said the long man coolly resuming his old employment of cutting tobacco
any man that owns a boy like that and cant find any better way treating on him deserves to lose him
such paper as these is a shame to kentucky that my mind right out if anybody wants to know
i ve got a gang of boy sir said the long man resuming his attack on the fire irons and i jest tells em boy says i run now
well now that a fact said mine host as he made an entry in his book dig put jest when ye want to
i never shall come to look after you that the way i keep mine let em know they are free to run any time and it jest breaks up their wanting to
em all recorded in case i gets keeled up any these time and they know it and i tell ye stranger there an t
more all i ve got free paper for a fellow in our part gets more out of his nigger than i do
why my boy have been to cincinnati with five hundred dollar worth of colts and brought me back the money all straight time and agin
it stands to reason they should treat em like dog and you ll have dog work and dog actions treat em like man and you ll have man work
and the honest drover in his warmth endorsed this moral sentiment by firing a perfect feu de joi at the fireplace
i think you re altogether right friend said mr_wilson and this boy described here is a fine fellow no mistake about that
he is an ingenious fellow too he invented a machine for the cleaning of hemp a really valuable affair it gone into use in several factories
he worked for me some half dozen year in my bagging factory and he was my best hand sir his master holds the patent of it
i ll warrant ye said the drover holds it and makes money out of it and then turns round and brands the boy in his right hand
these yer knowin boy is allers aggravatin and sarcy said a coarse looking fellow from the other side of the room that why they gets cut up and marked so
if i had a fair chance i mark him i reckon so that he carry it one while if they behaved themselves they wouldnt
that is to say the lord made em man and it a hard squeeze gettin em down into beasts said the drover dryly
bright nigger isnt no kind of vantage to their master continued the other well entrenched in a coarse unconscious obtuseness from the contempt of his opponent
what the use talents and them thing if you cant get the use on em yourself why all the use they make ont is to get round you
i ve had one or two of these fellers and i jest sold em down river i knew i got to lose em first or last if i didnt
better send orders up to the lord to make you a set and leave out their soul entirely said the drover
here the conversation was interrupted by the approach of a small one horse buggy to the inn it had a genteel appearance and a well dressed gentlemanly man sat on the seat with a colored servant driving
the whole party examined the new comer with the interest with which a set of loafers in a rainy day usually examine every newcomer
he was very tall with a dark spanish complexion fine expressive black eye and close curling hair also of a glossy blackness
his well formed aquiline nose straight thin lips and the admirable contour of his finely formed limbs impressed the whole company instantly with the idea of something uncommon
he walked easily in among the company and with a nod indicated to his waiter where to place his trunk bowed to the company and with his hat in his hand walked up leisurely to the bar and gave in his name as henry butter oaklands mr_shelby county
jim_crow he said to his man seems to me we met a boy something like this up at beman didnt we
turning with an indifferent air he sauntered up to the advertisement and read it over yes mas said jim_crow only i ant sure about the hand
then walking up to the landlord he desired him to furnish him with a private apartment as he had some writing to do immediately
the landlord was all obsequious and a relay of about seven negroes old and young male and female little and big were soon whizzing about like a covey of partridges bustling hurrying treading on each other toes and tumbling over each other in their zeal to get mas s room ready while he seated himself easily on a chair in the middle of the room and entered into conversation with the man who sat next to him
the manufacturer mr_wilson from the time of the entrance of the stranger had regarded him with an air of disturbed and uneasy curiosity
well i didnt look of course said the stranger with a careless yawn he seemed to himself to have met and been acquainted with him somewhere but he could not recollect
every few moment when the man spoke or moved or smiled he would start and fix his eye on him and then suddenly withdraw them as the bright dark eye met his with such unconcerned coolness
at last a sudden recollection seemed to flash upon him for he stared at the stranger with such an air of blank amazement and alarm that he walked up to him
mr_wilson i think said he in a tone of recognition and extending his hand i beg your pardon i didnt recollect you before
i see you remember me mr butler of oaklands mr_shelby county ye yes yes sir said mr_wilson like one speaking in a dream
jim_crow see to the trunks said the gentleman negligently then addressing himself to mr_wilson he added i should like to have a few moment conversation with you on business in my room if you please
mr_wilson followed him as one who walks in his sleep and they proceeded to a large upper chamber where a new made fire was crackling and various servant flying about putting finishing touches to the arrangements
when all was done and the servant departed the young man deliberately locked the door and putting the key in his pocket faced about and folding his arm on his bosom looked mr_wilson full in the face
just then a negro boy entered and announced that mas s room was ready george_harris said mr_wilson
yes george_harris said the young man i couldnt have thought it i am pretty well disguised i fancy said the young man with a smile
a little walnut bark has made my yellow skin a genteel brown and i ve dyed my hair black so you see i dont answer to the advertisement at all
george_harris but this is a dangerous game you are playing i could not have advised you to it i can do it on my own responsibility said george_harris with the same proud smile
his mother was one of those unfortunates of her race marked out by personal beauty to be the slave of the passions of her possessor and the mother of child who may never know a father
from one of the proudest family in kentucky he had inherited a set of fine european features and a high indomitable spirit
we remark en passant that george_harris was by his father side of white descent from his mother he had received only a slight mulatto tinge amply compensated by its accompanying rich dark eye
a slight change in the tint of the skin and the color of his hair had metamorphosed him into the spanish looking fellow he then appeared and as gracefulness of movement and gentlemanly manner had always been perfectly natural to him he found no difficulty in playing the bold part he had adopted that of a gentleman travelling with his domestic
mr_wilson a good natured but extremely fidgety and cautious old gentleman ambled up and down the room appearing as john_bunyan hath it much tumbled up and down in his mind and divided between his wish to help george_harris and a certain confused notion of maintaining law and order so as he shambled about he delivered himself as follows
well george_harris i pose you re running away leaving your lawful master george_harris i dont wonder at it at the same time i sorry george_harris yes decidedly i think i must say that george_harris it my duty to tell you so
why are you sorry sir said george_harris calmly why to see you as it were setting yourself in opposition to the law of your country
my country said george_harris with a strong and bitter emphasis what country have i but the grave and i wish to god that i was laid there
why george_harris no no it wont do this way of talking is wicked unscriptural george_harris you ve got a hard master in fact he is well he conducts himself reprehensibly
but you know how the angel commanded hagar to return to her mistress and submit herself under the hand and the apostle sent back onesimus to his master
i cant pretend to defend him gen the angel bade the pregnant hagar return to her mistress sarai even though sarai had dealt harshly with her
phil onesimus went back to his master to become no longer a servant but a brother beloved dont quote bible at me that way mr_wilson said george_harris with a flashing eye dont
for my wife is a christian and i mean to be if ever i get to where i can but to quote bible to a fellow in my circumstances is enough to make him give it up altogether
i appeal to god almighty i willing to go with the case to him and ask him if i do wrong to seek my freedom
these feeling are quite natural george_harris said the good natured man blowing his nose yes they re natural but it is my duty not to encourage em in you
yes my boy i sorry for you now it a bad case very bad but the apostle says let everyone abide in the condition in which he is called
george_harris stood with his head drawn back his arm folded tightly over his broad breast and a bitter smile curling his lips
i wonder mr_wilson if the indians should come and take you a prisoner away from your wife and child and want to keep you all your life hoeing corn for them if you think it your duty to abide in the condition in which you were called
we must all submit to the indications of providence george_harris dont you see i rather think that you think the first stray horse you could find an indication of providence shouldnt you
the little old gentleman stared with both eye at this illustration of the case but though not much of a reasoner he had the sense in which some logicians on this particular subject do not excel that of saying nothing where nothing could be said
so as he stood carefully stroking his umbrella and folding and patting down all the creases in it he proceeded on with his exhortations in a general way
you see george_harris you know now i always have stood your friend and whatever i ve said i ve said for your good
if you re taken it will be worse with you than ever they ll only abuse you and half kill you and sell you down the river
now here it seems to me you re running an awful risk you cant hope to carry it out
mr_wilson i know all this said george_harris i do run a risk but he threw open his overcoat and showed two pistols and a bowie knife
no if it comes to that i can earn myself at least six foot of free soil the first and last i shall ever own in kentucky
there he said i ready for em down south i never will go why george_harris this state of mind is awful it getting really desperate george_harris
mr_wilson you have a country but what country have i or any one like me born of slave mother
we dont make them we dont consent to them we have nothing to do with them all they do for us is to crush us and keep us down
i concerned going to break the law of your country my country again what law are there for us havent i heard your fourth of july speeches
dont you tell us all once a year that governments derive their just power from the consent of the governed cant a fellow think that hears such thing
mr_wilson mind was one of those that may not unaptly be represented by a bale of cotton downy soft benevolently fuzzy and confused
he really pitied george_harris with all his heart and had a sort of dim and cloudy perception of the style of feeling that agitated him but he deemed it his duty to go on talking good to him with infinite pertinacity
i must tell you you know as a friend you better not be meddling with such notions they are bad george_harris very bad for boy in your condition very and mr_wilson sat down to a table and began nervously chewing the handle of his umbrella
see here now mr_wilson said george_harris coming up and sitting himself determinately down in front of him look at me now
cant he put this and that together and see what it comes to george_harris this is bad dont i sit before you every way just as much a man as you are
look at my face look at my hand look at my body and the young man drew himself up proudly why am i not a man as much as anybody
i had a father one of your kentucky gentleman who didnt think enough of me to keep me from being sold with his dog and horse to satisfy the estate when he died
well mr_wilson hear what i can tell you i saw my mother put up at sheriff sale with her seven child
she came and kneeled down before old mas and begged him to buy her with me that she might have at least one child with her and he kicked her away with his heavy boot
i saw him do it and the last that i heard was her moans and screams when i was tied to his horse neck to be carried off to his place
they were sold before her eye one by one all to different master and i was the youngest well then
my master traded with one of the man and bought my oldest sister she was a pious good girl a member of the baptist church and as handsome as my poor mother had been
she was well brought up and had good manner at first i was glad she was bought for i had one friend near me
sir i have stood at the door and heard her whipped when it seemed as if every blow cut into my naked heart and i couldnt do anything to help her and she was whipped sir for wanting to live a decent christian life such as your law give no slave girl a right to live and at last i saw her chained with a trader gang to be sent to market in orleans sent there for nothing else
well i grew up long year and year no father no mother no sister not a living soul that cared for me more than a dog nothing but whipping scolding starving
why sir i ve been so hungry that i have been glad to take the bones they threw to their dog and yet when i was a little fellow and laid awake whole night and cried it wasnt the hunger it wasnt the whipping i cried for
i was soon sorry for it but that and that the last i know of her no sir it was for my mother and my sisters
it was because i hadnt a friend to love me on earth i never knew what peace or comfort was i never had a kind word spoken to me till i came to work in your factory
mr_wilson you treated me well you encouraged me to do well and to learn to read and write and to try to make something of myself and god knows how grateful i am for it
when i found she loved me when i married her i scarcely could believe i was alive i was so happy and sir she is as good as she is beautiful
why now comes my master takes me right away from my work and my friend and all i like and grinds me down into the very dirt
then sir i found my wife you ve seen her you know how beautiful she is but now what and why because he says i forgot who i was he says to teach me that i am only a nigger
after all and last of all he comes between me and my wife and says i shall give her up and live with another woman
and all this your law give him power to do in spite of god or man mr_wilson look at it
there isnt one of all these thing that have broken the heart of my mother and my sister and my wife and myself but your law allow and give every man power to do in kentucky and none can say to him nay
do you call these the law of my country sir i havent any country anymore than i have any father but i going to have one
i dont want anything of your country except to be let alone to go peaceably out of it and when i get to canada where the law will own me and protect me that shall be my country and its law i will obey
but if any man tries to stop me let him take care for i am desperate i ll fight for my liberty to the last breath i breathe
this speech delivered partly while sitting at the table and partly walking up and down the room delivered with tear and flashing eye and despairing gestures was altogether too much for the good natured old body to whom it was addressed who had pulled out a great yellow silk pocket handkerchief and was mopping up his face with great energy
you say your father did it if it was right for them it is right for me blast em all
he suddenly broke out havent i always said so the infernal old cusses i hope i ant swearing now
well go ahead george_harris go ahead but be careful my boy dont shoot anybody george_harris unless well you better not shoot i reckon
at least i wouldnt hit anybody you know where is your wife george_harris he added as he nervously rose and began walking the room
gone sir gone with her child in her arm the lord only knows where gone after the north star and when we ever meet or whether we meet at all in this world no creature can tell
kind family get in debt and the law of our country allow them to sell the child out of its mother bosom to pay its master debts said george_harris bitterly
is it possible astonishing from such a kind family well well said the honest old man fumbling in his pocket i pose perhaps
he added suddenly so here george_harris and taking out a roll of bills from his pocket book he offered them to george_harris
i ant following my judgment hang it i wont follow my judgment no my kind good sir said george_harris you ve done a great deal for me and this might get you into trouble
i have money enough i hope to take me as far as i need it no but you must george_harris
money is a great help everywhere cant have too much if you get it honestly take it do take it now do my boy
on condition sir that i may repay it at some future time i will said george_harris taking up the money
and now george_harris how long are you going to travel in this way not long or far i hope it well carried on but too bold
he heard after he got there that his master was so angry at him for going off that he had whipped his poor old mother and he has come all the way back to comfort her and get a chance to get her away
and this black fellow who is he a true fellow who went to canada more than a year ago has he got her
meanwhile he is going with me as far as ohio to put me among friend that helped him and then he will come back after her
not yet he has been hanging about the place and found no chance yet dangerous very dangerous said the old man
george_harris drew himself up and smiled disdainfully the old gentleman eyed him from head to foot with a sort of innocent wonder
george_harris something has brought you out wonderfully you hold up your head and speak and move like another man said mr_wilson
because i a freeman said george_harris proudly yes sir i ve said mas for the last time to any man
i free take care you are not sure you may be taken all man are free and equal in the grave if it comes to that mr_wilson said george_harris
mr_wilson it is so bold and this tavern is so near that they will never think of it they will look for me on ahead and you yourself wouldnt know me
i perfectly dumb founded with your boldness said mr_wilson to come right here to the nearest tavern jim_crow master dont live in this county he isnt known in these part
besides he is given up nobody is looking after him and nobody will take me up from the advertisement i think
but the mark in your hand george_harris drew off his glove and showed a newly healed scar in his hand
a fortnight ago he took it into his head to give it to me because he said he believed i should try to get away one of these day
that is a parting proof of mr george_harris regard he said scornfully looks interesting doesnt it he said drawing his glove on again
i declare my very blood runs cold when i think of it your condition and your risks said mr_wilson
mine has run cold a good many year mr_wilson at present it about up to the boiling point said george_harris
well my good sir continued george_harris after a few moment silence i saw you knew me i thought i just have this talk with you lest your surprised looks should bring me out
i leave early tomorrow morning before daylight by tomorrow night i hope to sleep safe in ohio i shall travel by daylight stop at the best hotels go to the dinner table with the lords of the land
so good by sir if you hear that i taken you may know that i dead george_harris stood up like a rock and put out his hand with the air of a prince
the friendly little old man shook it heartily and after a little shower of caution he took his umbrella and fumbled his way out of the room
george_harris stood thoughtfully looking at the door as the old man closed it a thought seemed to flash across his mind
the old gentleman entered again and george_harris as before locked the door and then stood for a few moment looking on the floor irresolutely
he hastily stepped to it and opening it said mr_wilson one word more at last raising his head with a sudden effort mr
wilson you have shown yourself a christian in your treatment of me i want to ask one last deed of christian kindness of you
there isnt on earth a living soul to care if i die he added drawing his breath hard and speaking with a great effort i shall be kicked out and buried like a dog and nobody ll think of it a day after only my poor wife
well george_harris well sir what you said was true i am running a dreadful risk poor soul she ll mourn and grieve and if you only contrive mr_wilson to send this little pin to her
she gave it to me for a christmas present poor child give it to her and tell her i loved her to the last
will you will you he added earnestly yes certainly poor fellow said the old gentleman taking the pin with watery eye and a melancholy quiver in his voice
tell her one thing said george_harris it my last wish if she can get to canada to go there no matter how kind her mistress
is no matter how much she love her home beg her not to go back for slavery always ends in misery tell her to bring up our boy a free man and then he wont suffer as i have
tell her this mr_wilson will you yes george_harris i ll tell her but i trust you wont die take heart you re a brave fellow
is there a god to trust in said george_harris in such a tone of bitter despair as arrested the old gentleman word
trust in the lord george_harris i wish in my heart you were safe through though that what i do i ve seen thing all my life that have made me feel that there cant be a god
you christians dont know how these thing look to us there a god for you but is there any for us
now dont dont my boy said the old man almost sobbing as he spoke dont feel so there is there is clouds and darkness are around about him but righteousness and judgment are the habitation of his throne
there a god george_harris believe it trust in him and i sure he ll help you everything will be set right if not in this life in another
the real piety and benevolence of the simple old man invested him with a temporary dignity and authority as he spoke
george_harris stopped his distracted walk up and down the room stood thoughtfully a moment and then said quietly thank you for saying that my good friend i ll think of that
in ramah there was a voice heard weeping and lamentation and great mourning rachel_halliday weeping for her child and would not be comforted
chapter xii select incident of lawful trade jer mr_haley and tom_loker jogged onward in their wagon each for a time absorbed in his own reflections
now the reflections of two man sitting side by side are a curious thing seated on the same seat having the same eye ear hand and organs of all sort and having pass before their eye the same objects it is wonderful what a variety we shall find in these same reflections
as for example mr_haley he thought first of tom_loker length and breadth and height and what he would sell for if he was kept fat and in good case till he got him into market
he thought of how he should make out his gang he thought of the respective market value of certain supposititious man and woman and child who were to compose it and other kindred topics of the business then he thought of himself and how humane he was that whereas other man chained their nigger hand and foot both he only put fetters on the foot and left tom_loker the use of his hand as long as he behaved well and he sighed to think how ungrateful human nature was so that there was even room to doubt whether tom_loker appreciated his mercies
he had been taken in so by nigger whom he had favored but still he was astonished to consider how good natured he yet remained
as to tom_loker he was thinking over some word of an unfashionable old book which kept running through his head again and again as follows we have here no continuing city but we seek one to come wherefore god himself is not ashamed to be called our god for he hath prepared for us a city
these word of an ancient volume got up principally by ignorant and unlearned man have through all time kept up somehow a strange sort of power over the mind of poor simple fellow like tom_loker
they stir up the soul from its depths and rouse as with trumpet call courage energy and enthusiasm where before was only the blackness of despair
he was not a remarkably fluent reader and was in the habit of reading in a sort of recitative half aloud by way of calling in his ear to verify the deductions of his eye
mr_haley pulled out of his pocket sundry newspapers and began looking over their advertisements with absorbed interest in this tone he slowly recited the following paragraph
executor sale negroes agreeably to order of court will be sold on tuesday february before the court house door in the town of washington kentucky
sold for the benefit of the creditors and heirs of the estate of jesse blutchford samuel morris thomas flint executors
the following negroes hagar aged john_bunyan aged ben aged saul aged albert aged this yer i must look at said he to tom_loker for want of somebody else to talk to
ye see i going to get up a prime gang to take down with ye tom_loker it ll make it sociable and pleasant like good company will ye know
we must drive right to washington first and foremost and then i ll clap you into jail while i does the business
tom_loker received this agreeable intelligence quite meekly simply wondering in his own heart how many of these doomed man had wife and child and whether they would feel as he did about leaving them
it is to be confessed too that the naive off hand information that he was to be thrown into jail by no means produced an agreeable impression on a poor fellow who had always prided himself on a strictly honest and upright course of life
yes tom_loker we must confess it was rather proud of his honesty poor fellow not having very much else to be proud of if he had belonged to some of the higher walks of society he perhaps would never have been reduced to such straits
however the day wore on and the evening saw mr_haley and tom_loker comfortably accommodated in washington the one in a tavern and the other in a jail
about eleven clock the next day a mixed throng was gathered around the court house steps smoking chewing spitting swearing and conversing according to their respective tastes and turns waiting for the auction to commence
the man and woman to be sold sat in a group apart talking in a low tone to each other
she might have been sixty but was older than that by hard work and disease was partially blind and somewhat crippled with rheumatism
the woman who had been advertised by the name of hagar was a regular african in feature and figure by her side stood her only remaining son albert a bright looking little fellow of fourteen year
the boy was the only survivor of a large family who had been successively sold away from her to a southern market
the mother held on to him with both her shaking hand and eyed with intense trepidation every one who walked up to examine him
dont be feard aunt hagar said the oldest of the man i spoke to mas thomas bout it and he thought he might manage to sell you in a lot both together
dey neednt call me worn out yet said she lifting her shaking hand i can cook yet and scrub and scour i wuth a buying if i do come
mr_haley here forced his way into the group walked up to the old man pulled his mouth open and looked in felt of his teeth made him stand and straighten himself bend his back and perform various evolutions to show his muscles and then passed on to the next and put him through the same trial
walking up last to the boy he felt of his arm straightened his hand and looked at his fingers and made him jump to show his agility
he ant gwine to be sold widout me said the old woman with passionate eagerness he and i goes in a lot together i rail strong yet mas and can do heaps
cheap tell em dat ar you tell em she added earnestly work heaps on it mas on plantation said mr_haley with a contemptuous glance
likely story and as if satisfied with his examination he walked out and looked and stood with his hand in his pocket his cigar in his mouth and his hat cocked on one side ready for action
what think of em said a man who had been following mr_haley examination as if to make up his own mind from it
wal said mr_haley spitting i shall put in i think for the youngerly one and the boy
they want to sell the boy and the old woman together said the man find it a tight pull why she an old rack bones not worth her salt
you wouldnt then said the man anybody be a foolt would she half blind crooked with rheumatis and foolish to boot
some buys up these yer old critturs and ses there a sight more wear in em than a body think said the man reflectively
walt is kinder pity now not to buy her with her son her heart seems so sot on him pose they fling her in cheap
no got all said mr_haley wouldnt take her for a present fact i ve seen now them that got money to spend that ar way
i shall bid off on that ar boy for a plantation hand wouldnt be bothered with her no way not if they give her to me said mr_haley
it all well enough she ll take on despt said the man nat lly she will said the trader coolly
the conversation was here interrupted by a busy hum in the audience and the auctioneer a short bustling important fellow elbowed his way into the crowd
the old woman drew in her breath and caught instinctively at her son keep close to yer mammy albert close dey ll put us up togedder she said
mammy i feard they wont said the boy dey must child i cant live no way if they dont said the old creature vehemently
the stentorian tone of the auctioneer calling out to clear the way now announced that the sale was about to commence
the different man on the list were soon knocked off at prices which showed a pretty brisk demand in the market two of them fell to mr_haley
come now young un said the auctioneer giving the boy a touch with his hammer be up and show your springs now
a place was cleared and the bidding began put us two up togedder togedder do please mas said the old woman holding fast to her boy
now darkey spring and with the word he pushed the boy toward the block while a deep heavy groan rose behind him
the boy paused and looked back but there was no time to stay and dashing the tear from his large bright eye he was up in a moment
his fine figure alert limbs and bright face raised an instant competition and half a dozen bids simultaneously met the ear of the auctioneer
anxious half frightened he looked from side to side as he heard the clatter of contending bids now here now there till the hammer fell
he was pushed from the block toward his new master but stopped one moment and looked back when his poor old mother trembling in every limb held out her shaking hand toward him
be off said the man gruffly pushing her hand away you come last mr_haley had got him buy me too mas for de dear lord sake buy me i shall die if you dont
you ll die if i do that the kink of it said mr_haley no and he turned on his heel the bidding for the poor old creature was summary
the man who had addressed mr_haley and who seemed not destitute of compassion bought her for a trifle and the spectators began to disperse
the poor victims of the sale who had been brought up in one place together for year gathered round the despairing old mother whose agony was pitiful to see
couldnt dey leave me one mas allers said i should have one he did she repeated over and over in heart broken tone
trust in the lord aunt hagar said the oldest of the man sorrowfully what good will it do said she sobbing passionately
mother mother dont dont said the boy they say you got a good master i dont care i dont care
come take her off cant some of ye said mr_haley dryly dont do no good for her to go on that ar way
the old man of the company partly by persuasion and partly by force loosed the poor creature last despairing hold and as they led her off to her new master wagon strove to comfort her
now said mr_haley pushing his three purchases together and producing a bundle of handcuffs which he proceeded to put on their wrists and fastening each handcuff to a long chain he drove them before him to the jail
o albert oh my boy you my last baby lord how ken i a few day saw mr_haley with his possessions safely deposited on one of the ohio boat
it was the commencement of his gang to be augmented as the boat moved on by various other merchandise of the same kind which he or his agent had stored for him in various points along shore
the la belle riviere as brave and beautiful a boat as ever walked the water of her namesake river was floating gayly down the stream under a brilliant sky the stripes and stars of free america waving and fluttering over head
all was full of life buoyant and rejoicing all but mr_haley gang who were stored with other freight on the lower deck and who somehow did not seem to appreciate their various privileges as they sat in a knot talking to each other in low tone
the guards crowded with well dressed lady and gentleman walking and enjoying the delightful day boy said mr_haley coming up briskly i hope you keep up good heart and are cheerful
now no sulks ye see keep stiff upper lip boy do well by me and i ll do well by you
yes mas for ages the watchword of poor africa but it to be owned they did not look particularly cheerful they had their various little prejudices in favor of wife mother sisters and child seen for the last time and though they that wasted them required of them mirth it was not instantly forthcoming
i ve got a wife spoke out the article enumerated as john_bunyan aged thirty and he laid his chained hand on tom_loker knee and
the boy addressed responded the invariable she dont know a word about this poor girl where does she live said tom_loker
in a tavern a piece down here said john_bunyan i wish now i could see her once more in this world he added
it was rather natural and the tear that fell as he spoke came as naturally as if he had been a white man
poor john_bunyan tom_loker drew a long breath from a sore heart and tried in his poor way to comfort him
and over head in the cabin sat father and mother husband and wife and merry dancing child moved round among them like so many little butterflies and everything was going on quite easy and comfortable
o mamma said a boy who had just come up from below there a negro trader on board and he brought four or five slave down there
poor creature said the mother in a tone between grief and indignation what that said another lady
some poor slave below said the mother and they ve got chains on said the boy what a shame to our country that such sights are to be seen said another lady
o there a great deal to be said on both side of the subject said a genteel woman who sat at her state room door sewing while her little girl and boy were playing round her
i ve been south and i must say i think the negroes are better off than they would be to be free
in some respects some of them are well off i grant said the lady to whose remark she had answered
the most dreadful part of slavery to my mind is its outrages on the feeling and affections the separating of family for example
that is a bad thing certainly said the other lady holding up a baby dress she had just completed and looking intently on its trimmings but then i fancy it dont occur often
it does said the first lady eagerly i ve lived many year in kentucky and virginia both and i ve seen enough to make any one heart sick
we cant reason from our feeling to those of this class of persons said the other lady sorting out some worsteds on her lap
suppose ma am your two child there should be taken from you and sold indeed ma am you can know nothing of them if you say so answered the first lady warmly
i was born and brought up among them i know they do feel just as keenly even more so perhaps as we do
yawned and looked out the cabin window and finally repeated for a finale the remark with which she had begun after all i think they are better off than they would be to be free
it undoubtedly the intention of providence that the african race should be servant kept in a low condition said a grave looking gentleman in black a clergyman seated by the cabin door
the lady said indeed cursed be canaan a servant of servant shall he be the scripture says
this is what noah says when he wakes out of drunkenness and realizes that his youngest son ham father of canaan has seen him naked
gen i say stranger is that ar what that text means said a tall man standing by
it pleased providence for some inscrutable reason to doom the race to bondage ages ago and we must not set up our opinion against that
well then we ll all go ahead and buy up nigger said the man if that the way of providence wont we squire said he turning to mr_haley who had been standing with his hand in his pocket by the stove and intently listening to the conversation
undoubtedly yes continued the tall man we must all be resigned to the decrees of providence nigger must be sold and trucked round and kept under it what they made for
pears like this yer view quite refreshing ant it stranger said he to mr_haley i never thought ont said mr_haley i couldnt have said as much myself
i took up the trade just to make a living if tant right i calculated to pent ont in time ye know
i ha nt no larning and now you ll save yerself the trouble wont ye said the tall man see whatt is now to know scripture
if ye only studied yer bible like this yer good man ye might have know it before and saved ye a heap trouble
and the stranger who was no other than the honest drover whom we introduced to our readers in the kentucky tavern sat down and began smoking with a curious smile on his long dry face
a tall slender young man with a face expressive of great feeling and intelligence here broke in and repeated the word
ye could jist have said cussed be what his name andt would all have come right all thing whatsoever ye
would that man should do unto you do ye even so unto them i suppose he added that is scripture as much as cursed be canaan
wal it seems quite as plain a text stranger said john_bunyan the drover to poor fellow like us now and john_bunyan smoked on like a volcano
the young man paused looked as if he was going to say more when suddenly the boat stopped and the company made the usual steamboat rush to see where they were landing
both them ar chaps parsons said john_bunyan to one of the man as they were going out the man nodded
as the boat stopped a black woman came running wildly up the plank darted into the crowd flew up to where the slave gang sat and threw her arm round that unfortunate piece of merchandise before enumerate john_bunyan aged thirty and with sobs and tear bemoaned him as her husband
but what needs tell the story told too oft every day told of heart strings rent and broken the weak broken and torn for the profit and convenience of the strong
it needs not to be told every day is telling it telling it too in the ear of one who is not deaf though he be long silent
the young man who had spoken for the cause of humanity and god before stood with folded arm looking on this scene
he turned and mr_haley was standing at his side my friend he said speaking with thick utterance how can you how dare you carry on a trade like this
here i am rejoicing in my heart that i am going home to my wife and child and the same bell which is a signal to carry me onward towards them will part this poor man and his wife forever
look at those poor creature depend upon it god will bring you into judgment for this the trader turned away in silence
i say now said the drover touching his elbow there differences in parsons ant there cussed be canaan dont seem to go down with this un does it
and that ar ant the worst ont said john_bunyan mabbee it wont go down with the lord neither when ye come to settle with him one these day as all on us must i reckon
if i make pretty handsomely on one or two next gangs he thought i reckon i ll stop off this yer it really getting dangerous
and he took out his pocket book and began adding over his accounts a process which many gentleman besides mr_haley have found a specific for an uneasy conscience
mr_haley gave an uneasy growl mr_haley walked reflectively to the other end of the boat the boat swept proudly away from the shore and all went on merrily as before
one day when she lay to for a while at a small town in kentucky mr_haley went up into the place on a little matter of business
tom_loker whose fetters did not prevent his taking a moderate circuit had drawn near the side of the boat and stood listlessly gazing over the railing
after a time he saw the trader returning with an alert step in company with a colored woman bearing in her arm a young child
man talked and loafed and read and smoked woman sewed and child played and the boat passed on her way she was dressed quite respectably and a colored man followed her bringing along a small trunk
the woman came cheerfully onward talking as she came with the man who bore her trunk and so passed up the plank into the boat
the woman walked forward among the boxes and bales of the lower deck and sitting down busied herself with chirruping to her baby
mr_haley made a turn or two about the boat and then coming up seated himself near her and began saying something to her in an indifferent undertone
the bell rung the steamer whizzed the engine groaned and coughed and away swept the boat down the river tom_loker soon noticed a heavy cloud passing over the woman brow and that she answered rapidly and with great vehemence
i dont believe it i wont believe it he heard her say you re jist a foolin with me
if you wont believe it look here said the man drawing out a paper this yer the bill of sale and there your master name to it and i paid down good solid cash for it too
i can tell you so now i dont believe mas would cheat me so it cant be true said the woman with increasing agitation
you can ask any of these man here that can read writing here he said to a man that was passing by jist read this yer wont you
why it a bill of sale signed by john_bunyan fosdick said the man making over to you the girl lucy and her child
this yer gal wont believe me when i tell her whatt is it all straight enough for aught i see
the woman passionate exclamations collected a crowd around her and the trader briefly explained to them the cause of the agitation
he told me that i was going down to louisville to hire out as cook to the same tavern where my husband work that what mas told me his own self and i cant believe he lie to me said the woman
but he has sold you my poor woman there no doubt about it said a good natured looking man who had been examining the paper he has done it and no mistake
then it no account talking said the woman suddenly growing quite calm and clasping her child tighter in her arm she sat down on her box turned her back round and gazed listlessly into the river
going to take it easy after all said the trader gal got grit i see
the woman looked calm as the boat went on and a beautiful soft summer breeze passed like a compassionate spirit over her head the gentle breeze that never inquires whether the brow is dusky or fair that it fans
and she saw sunshine sparkling on the water in golden ripples and heard gay voice full of ease and pleasure talking around her everywhere but her heart lay as if a great stone had fallen on it
her baby raised himself up against her and stroked her cheeks with his little hand and springing up and down crowing and chatting seemed determined to arouse her
she strained him suddenly and tightly in her arm and slowly one tear after another fell on his wondering unconscious face and gradually she seemed and little by little to grow calmer and busied herself with tending and nursing him
the child a boy of ten months was uncommonly large and strong of his age and very vigorous in his limbs
never for a moment still he kept his mother constantly busy in holding him and guarding his springing activity
that a fine chap said a man suddenly stopping opposite to him with his hand in his pocket how old is he
the man whistled to the boy and offered him part of a stick of candy which he eagerly grabbed at and very soon had it in a baby general depository to wit his mouth
ten months and a half said the mother rum fellow said the man knows what what and he whistled and walked on
when he had got to the other side of the boat he came across mr_haley who was smoking on top of a pile of boxes
the stranger produced a match and lighted a cigar saying as he did so decentish kind wench you ve got round there stranger
why i reckon she is tol able fair said mr_haley blowing the smoke out of his mouth taking her down south
said the man mr_haley nodded and smoked on plantation hand said the man wal said mr_haley i fillin out an order for a plantation and i think i shall put her in
they telled me she was a good cook and they can use her for that or set her at the cotton picking
she got the right fingers for that i looked at em sell well either way and mr_haley resumed his cigar
they wont want the young un on the plantation said the man i shall sell him first chance i find said mr_haley lighting another cigar
pose you be selling him tol able cheap said the stranger mounting the pile of boxes and sitting down comfortably
dont know bout that said mr_haley he a pretty smart young un straight fat strong flesh as hard as a brick
nonsense said mr_haley they is raised as easy as any kind of critter there is going they ant a bit more trouble than pups
very true but then there the bother and expense of raisin this yer chap will be running all around in a month
i ve got a good place for raisin and i thought of takin in a little more stock said the man
one cook lost a young un last week got drownded in a washtub while she was a hangin out the clothes and
i reckon it would be well enough to set her to raisin this yer mr_haley and the stranger smoked a while in silence neither seeming willing to broach the test question of the interview
at last the man resumed you wouldnt think of wantin more than ten dollar for that ar chap seeing you must get him off yer hand any how
mr_haley shook his head and spit impressively that wont do no way he said and began his smoking again
well now said mr_haley i could raise that ar chap myself or get him raised he oncommon likely and healthy and he fetch a hundred dollar six months hence and in a year or two he bring two hundred if i had him in the right spot
well stranger what will you take i shant take a cent less nor fifty for him now
stranger that rediculous altogether said the man fact said mr_haley with a decisive nod of his head
i ll give thirty for him said the stranger but not a cent more now i ll tell ye what i will do said mr_haley spitting again with renewed decision
i ll split the difference and say forty five and that the most i will do well agreed said the man after an interval
done said mr_haley where do you land at louisville said the man louisville said mr_haley very fair we get there about dusk
chap will be asleep all fair get him off quietly and no screaming happens beautiful i like to do everything quietly i hates all kind of agitation and fluster
and so after a transfer of certain bills had passed from the man pocket book to the trader he resumed his cigar
it was a bright tranquil evening when the boat stopped at the wharf at louisville the woman had been sitting with her baby in her arm now wrapped in a heavy sleep
when she heard the name of the place called out she hastily laid the child down in a little cradle formed by the hollow among the boxes first carefully spreading under it her cloak and then she sprung to the side of the boat in hopes that among the various hotel waiters who thronged the wharf she might see her husband
in this hope she pressed forward to the front rails and stretching far over them strained her eye intently on the moving head on the shore and the crowd pressed in between her and the child
dont wake him up and set him to crying now it would make a devil of a fuss with the gal
now your time said mr_haley taking the sleeping child up and handing him to the stranger the man took the bundle carefully and was soon lost in the crowd that went up the wharf
when the boat creaking and groaning and puffing had loosed from the wharf and was beginning slowly to strain herself along the woman returned to her old seat
the trader was sitting there the child was gone why why where she began in bewildered surprise lucy said the trader your child gone you may as well know it first as last
you see i know you couldnt take him down south and i got a chance to sell him to a first rate family
the trader had arrived at that stage of christian and political perfection which has been recommended by some preachers and politicians of the north lately in which he had completely overcome every humane weakness and prejudice
that ll raise him better than you can his heart was exactly where yours sir and mine could be brought with proper effort and cultivation
the wild look of anguish and utter despair that the woman cast on him might have disturbed one less practised but he was used to it
you can get used to such thing too my friend and it is the great object of recent efforts to make our whole northern community used to them for the glory of the union
so the trader only regarded the mortal anguish which he saw working in those dark features those clenched hand and suffocating breathings as necessary incidents of the trade and merely calculated whether she was going to scream and get up a commotion on the boat for like other supporters of our peculiar institution he decidedly disliked agitation
he had seen that same look hundreds of time but the woman did not scream the shot had passed too straight and direct through the heart for cry or tear
dizzily she sat down her slack hand fell lifeless by her side her eye looked straight forward but she saw nothing
all the noise and hum of the boat the groaning of the machinery mingled dreamily to her bewildered ear and the poor dumb stricken heart had neither cry not tear to show for its utter misery
the trader who considering his advantages was almost as humane as some of our politicians seemed to feel called on to administer such consolation as the case admitted of
i know this yer comes kinder hard at first lucy said he but such a smart sensible gal as you are wont give way to it
she was quite calm you see it necessary and cant be helped dont mas dont said the woman with a voice like one that is smothering
you re a smart wench lucy he persisted i mean to do well by ye and get ye a nice place down river and you ll soon get another husband such a likely gal as you
mas if you only wont talk to me now said the woman in a voice of such quick and living anguish that the trader felt that there was something at present in the case beyond his style of operation
he got up and the woman turned away and buried her head in her cloak the trader walked up and down for a time and occasionally stopped and looked at her
takes it hard rather he soliloquized but quiet tho let her sweat a while she ll come right by and by
tom_loker had watched the whole transaction from first to last and had a perfect understanding of its results to him it looked like something unutterably horrible and cruel because poor ignorant black soul
if he had only been instructed by certain ministers of christianity he might have thought better of it and seen in it an every day incident of a lawful trade a trade which is the vital support of an institution which an american divine tells us has no evils but such as are inseparable from any other relations in social and domestic life
but tom_loker as we see being a poor ignorant fellow whose reading had been confined entirely to the new testament could not comfort and solace himself with views like these
his very soul bled within him for what seemed to him the wrongs of the poor suffering thing that lay like a crushed reed on the boxes the feeling living bleeding yet immortal thing which american state law coolly classes with the bundles and bales and boxes among which she is lying
he had not learned to generalize and to take enlarged views dr joel parker of philadelphia mrs stowe note
presbyterian clergyman a friend of the beecher family mrs stowe attempted unsuccessfully to have this identifying note removed from the stereotype plate of the first edition
honestly and with tear running down his own cheeks he spoke of a heart of love in the skies of a pitying lord_jesus and an eternal home but the ear was deaf with anguish and the palsied heart could not feel
tom_loker drew near and tried to say something but she only groaned night came on night calm unmoved and glorious shining down with her innumerable and solemn angel eye twinkling beautiful but silent
one after another the voice of business or pleasure died away all on the boat were sleeping and the ripples at the prow were plainly heard
tom_loker stretched himself out on a box and there as he lay he heard ever and anon a smothered sob or cry from the prostrate creature
there was no speech nor language no pitying voice or helping hand from that distant sky what shall i do lord
o good lord do help me and so ever and anon until the murmur died away in silence at midnight tom_loker waked with a sudden start
something black passed quickly by him to the side of the boat and he heard a splash in the water no one else saw or heard anything
the poor bleeding heart was still at last and the river rippled and dimpled just as brightly as if it had not closed above it
he raised his head the woman place was vacant he got up and sought about him in vain patience patience ye whose heart swell indignant at wrongs like these
not one throb of anguish not one tear of the oppressed is forgotten by the man of sorrows the lord of glory
bear thou like him in patience and labor in love for sure as he is god the year of his redeemed shall come
in his patient generous bosom he bears the anguish of a world the trader waked up bright and early and came out to see to his live stock
it was now his turn to look about in perplexity where alive is that gal he said to tom_loker
tom_loker who had learned the wisdom of keeping counsel did not feel called upon to state his observations and suspicions but said he did not know
she surely couldnt have got off in the night at any of the landings for i was awake and on the lookout whenever the boat stopped
i never trust these yer thing to other folks this speech was addressed to tom_loker quite confidentially as if it was something that would be specially interesting to him
the trader searched the boat from stem to stern among boxes bales and barrels around the machinery by the chimneys in vain
now i say tom_loker be fair about this yer he said when after a fruitless search he came where tom_loker was standing
i saw the gal stretched out here about ten clock and ag in at twelve and ag in between one and two and then at four she was gone and you was a sleeping right there all the time
tom_loker made no answer you know something about it now dont tell me i know you do now you know something you
well mas said tom_loker towards morning something brushed by me and i kinder half woke and then i hearn a great splash and then i augustine_st_clare woke up and the gal was gone
the trader was not shocked nor amazed because as we said before he was used to a great many thing that you are not used to
cant help it that all i know ont even the awful presence of death struck no solemn chill upon him
he had seen death many time met him in the way of trade and got acquainted with him and he only thought of him as a hard customer that embarrassed his property operations very unfairly and so he only swore that the gal was a baggage and that he was devilish unlucky and that if thing went on in this way he should not make a cent on the trip
in short he seemed to consider himself an ill used man decidedly but there was no help for it as the woman had escaped into a state which never will give up a fugitive not even at the demand of the whole glorious union
the trader therefore sat discontentedly down with his little account book and put down the missing body and soul under the head of losses
he a shocking creature isnt he this trader so unfeeling it dreadful really but nobody thinks anything of these trader
they are universally despised never received into any decent society but who sir makes the trader who is most to blame
the enlightened cultivated intelligent man who supports the system of which the trader is the inevitable result or the poor trader himself
you make the public statement that calls for his trade that debauches and depraves him till he feels no shame in it and in what are you better than he
are you educated and he ignorant you high and he low you refined and he coarse you talented and he simple
in concluding these little incidents of lawful trade we must beg the world not to think that american legislators are entirely destitute of humanity as might perhaps be unfairly inferred from the great efforts made in our national body to protect and perpetuate this species of traffic
in the day of a future judgment these very considerations may make it more tolerable for him than for you who does not know how our great man are outdoing themselves in declaiming against the foreign slave trade
there are a perfect host of clarksons and wilberforces risen up among us on that subject most edifying to hear and behold
trading negroes from africa dear reader is so horrid it is not to be thought of but trading them from kentucky that quite another thing
thomas clarkson and william wilberforce english philanthropists and anti slavery agitators who helped to secure passage of the emancipation bill by parliament in
a large roomy neatly painted kitchen its yellow floor glossy and smooth and without a particle of dust a neat well blacked cooking stove rows of shining tin suggestive of unmentionable good thing to the appetite glossy green wood chair old and firm a small flag bottomed rocking chair with a patch work cushion in it neatly contrived out of small pieces of different colored woollen goods and a larger sized one motherly and old whose wide arm breathed hospitable invitation seconded by the solicitation of its feather cushions a real comfortable persuasive old chair and worth in the way of honest homely enjoyment a dozen of your plush or brochetelle drawing room gentry and in the chair gently swaying back and forward her eye bent on some fine sewing sat our fine old friend eliza_harris
yes there she is paler and thinner than in her kentucky home with a world of quiet sorrow lying under the shadow of her long eyelashes and marking the outline of her gentle mouth
it was plain to see how old and firm the girlish heart was grown under the discipline of heavy sorrow and when anon her large dark eye was raised to follow the gambols of her little harry who was sporting like some tropical butterfly hither and thither over the floor she showed a depth of firmness and steady resolve that was never there in her earlier and happier day
by her side sat a woman with a bright tin pan in her lap into which she was carefully sorting some dried peaches
she might be fifty five or sixty but hers was one of those face that time seems to touch only to brighten and adorn
chapter xiii the quaker settlement a quiet scene now rises before us the snowy lisse crape cap made after the strait quaker pattern the
plain white muslin handkerchief lying in placid folds across her bosom the drab shawl and dress showed at once the community to which she belonged
her hair partially silvered by age was parted smoothly back from a high placid forehead on which time had written no inscription except peace on earth good will to man and beneath shone a large pair of clear honest loving brown eye you only needed to look straight into them to feel that you saw to the bottom of a heart as good and true as ever throbbed in woman bosom
so much has been said and sung of beautiful young girl why dont somebody wake up to the beauty of old woman
if any want to get up an inspiration under this head we refer them to our good friend rachel_halliday just as she sits there in her little rocking chair
her face was round and rosy with a healthful downy softness suggestive of a ripe peach it had a turn for quacking and squeaking that chair
had either from having taken cold in early life or from some asthmatic affection or perhaps from nervous derangement but as she gently swung backward and forward the chair kept up a kind of subdued creechy crawchy that would have been intolerable in any other chair
but old simeon_halliday often declared it was as good as any music to him and the child all avowed that they wouldnt miss of hearing mother chair for anything in the world
for why for twenty year or more nothing but loving word and gentle moralities and motherly loving kindness had come from that chair head aches and heart aches innumerable had been cured there difficulties spiritual and temporal solved there all by one good loving woman god bless her
and so thee still thinks of going to canada eliza_harris she said as she was quietly looking over her peaches
yes ma am said eliza_harris firmly i must go onward i dare not stop and what ll thee do when thee gets there
my daughter came naturally from the lips of rachel_halliday for hers was just the face and form that made mother seem the most natural word in the world
eliza_harris hand trembled and some tear fell on her fine work but she answered firmly i shall do anything i can find
thee must think about that my daughter i hope i can find something thee knows thee can stay here as long as thee pleases said rachel_halliday
thank you said eliza_harris but she pointed to harry i cant sleep night i cant rest last night i dreamed i saw that man coming into the yard she said shuddering
poor child said rachel_halliday wiping her eye but thee mustnt feel so the lord hath ordered it so that never hath a fugitive been stolen from our village
the door here opened and a little short round pin cushiony woman stood at the door with a cheery blooming face like a ripe apple
i trust thine will not be the first she was dressed like rachel_halliday in sober gray with the muslin folded neatly across her round plump little chest
nicely said ruth taking off her little drab bonnet and dusting it with her handkerchief displaying as she did so a round little head on which the quaker cap sat with a sort of jaunty air despite all the stroking and patting of the small fat hand which were busily applied to arranging it
certain stray locks of decidedly curly hair too had escaped here and there and had to be coaxed and cajoled into their place again and then the new comer who might have been five and twenty turned from the small looking glass before which she had been making these arrangements and looked well pleased as most people who looked at her might have been for
ruth stedman said rachel_halliday coming joyfully forward how is thee ruth she said heartily taking both her hand she was decidedly a wholesome whole hearted chirruping little woman as ever gladdened man heart withal
i am glad to see thee eliza_harris very said ruth shaking hand as if eliza_harris were an old friend she had long been expecting and this is thy dear
boy i brought a cake for him she said holding out a little heart to the boy who came up gazing through his curls and accepted it shyly
ruth this friend is eliza_harris george_harris and this is the little boy i told thee of where thy baby ruth said rachel_halliday
o he coming but thy mary caught him as i came in and ran off with him to the barn to show him to the child
at this moment the door opened and mary an honest rosy looking girl with large brown eye like her mother came in with the baby
ah ha said rachel_halliday coming up and taking the great white fat fellow in her arm how good he looks and how he does grow
to be sure he does said little bustling ruth as she took the child and began taking off a little blue silk hood and various layers and wrappers of outer garments and having given a twitch here and a pull there and variously adjusted and arranged him and kissed him heartily she set him on the floor to collect his thoughts
baby seemed quite used to this mode of proceeding for he put his thumb in his mouth as if it were quite a thing of course and seemed soon absorbed in his own reflections while the mother seated herself and taking out a long stocking of mixed blue and white yarn began to knit with briskness
mary took the kettle to the well and soon reappearing placed it over the stove where it was soon purring and steaming a sort of censer of hospitality and good cheer
the peaches moreover in obedience to a few gentle whispers from rachel_halliday were soon deposited by the same hand in a stew pan over the fire
rachel_halliday now took down a snowy moulding board and tying on an apron proceeded quietly to making up some biscuits first saying to mary mary hadnt thee better tell john_bunyan to get a chicken ready and mary disappeared accordingly
mary thee better fill the kettle hadnt thee gently suggested the mother and how is abigail peters said rachel_halliday as she went on with her biscuits
leah hills went in this afternoon and baked bread and pies enough to last some day and i engaged to go back to get her up this evening
she better said ruth i was in this morning made the bed tidied up the house i will go in tomorrow and do any cleaning there may be and look over the mending said rachel_halliday
ah that is well said ruth i ve heard she added that hannah stanwood is sick john_bunyan was up there last night i must go there tomorrow
john_bunyan can come in here to his meals if thee needs to stay all day suggested rachel_halliday thank thee rachel_halliday will see tomorrow but here comes simeon_halliday
simeon_halliday a tall straight muscular man in drab coat and pantaloons and broad brimmed hat now entered how is thee ruth
he said warmly as he spread his broad open hand for her little fat palm and how is john_bunyan
john_bunyan is well and all the rest of our folks said ruth cheerily any news father said rachel_halliday as she was putting her biscuits into the oven
peter stebbins told me that they should be along tonight with friend said simeon_halliday significantly as he was washing his hand at a neat sink in a little back porch
indeed said rachel_halliday looking thoughtfully and glancing at eliza_harris did thee say thy name was george_harris said simeon_halliday to eliza_harris as he reentered
rachel_halliday glanced quickly at her husband as eliza_harris tremulously answered yes her fears ever uppermost suggesting that possibly there might be advertisements out for her
mother said simeon_halliday standing in the porch and calling rachel_halliday out what does thee want father said rachel_halliday rubbing her floury hand as she went into the porch
this child husband is in the settlement and will be here tonight said simeon_halliday now thee doesnt say that father said rachel_halliday all her face radiant with joy
peter was down yesterday with the wagon to the other stand and there he found an old woman and two man and one said his name was george_harris and from what he told of his history i am certain who he is
it really true he is a bright likely fellow too shall we tell her now said simeon_halliday let tell ruth said rachel_halliday
here ruth come here ruth laid down her knitting work and was in the back porch in a moment ruth what does thee think said rachel_halliday
father says eliza_harris husband is in the last company and will be here tonight a burst of joy from the little quakeress interrupted the speech
she gave such a bound from the floor as she clapped her little hand that two stray curls fell from under her quaker cap and lay brightly on her white neckerchief
hush thee dear said rachel_halliday gently hush ruth tell us shall we tell her now now to be sure this very minute
thee uses thyself only to learn how to love thy neighbor ruth said simeon_halliday looking with a beaming face on ruth
why now supposet was my john_bunyan how should i feel do tell her right off to be sure
isnt it what we are made for if i didnt love john_bunyan and the baby i should not know how to feel for her
come now do tell her do and she laid her hand persuasively on rachel_halliday arm take her into thy bed room there and let me fry the chicken while thee does it
rachel_halliday came out into the kitchen where eliza_harris was sewing and opening the door of a small bed room said gently come in here with me my daughter i have news to tell thee
the blood flushed in eliza_harris pale face she rose trembling with nervous anxiety and looked towards her boy
no no said little ruth darting up and seizing her hand never thee fear it good news eliza_harris go in go in
and she gently pushed her to the door which closed after her and then turning round she caught little harry in her arm and began kissing him
thee ll see thy father little one does thee know it thy father is coming she said over and over again as the boy looked wonderingly at her
rachel_halliday drew eliza_harris toward her and said the lord hath had mercy on thee daughter thy husband hath escaped from the house of bondage
the blood flushed to eliza_harris cheek in a sudden glow and went back to her heart with as sudden a rush
meanwhile within the door another scene was going on she sat down pale and faint have courage child said rachel_halliday laying her hand on her head
he is among friend who will bring him here tonight tonight eliza_harris repeated tonight the word lost all meaning to her her head was dreamy and confused all was mist for a moment
when she awoke she found herself snugly tucked up on the bed with a blanket over her and little ruth rubbing her hand with camphor
she opened her eye in a state of dreamy delicious languor such as one who has long been bearing a heavy load and now feels it gone and would rest
the tension of the nerves which had never ceased a moment since the first hour of her flight had given way and a strange feeling of security and rest came over her and as she lay with her large dark eye open she followed as in a quiet dream the motions of those about her
she saw the door open into the other room saw the supper table with its snowy cloth heard the dreamy murmur of the singing tea kettle saw ruth tripping backward and forward with plates of cake and saucers of preserves and ever and anon stopping to put a cake into harry hand or pat his head or twine his long curls round her snowy fingers
she saw the ample motherly form of rachel_halliday as she ever and anon came to the bedside and smoothed and arranged something about the bedclothes and gave a tuck here and there by way of expressing her good will and was conscious of a kind of sunshine beaming down upon her from her large clear brown eye
her fly up to him and commence whispering very earnestly ever and anon with impressive gesture pointing her little finger toward the room
she saw her with the baby in her arm sitting down to tea she saw them all at table and little harry in a high chair under the shadow of rachel_halliday ample wing there were low murmurs of talk gentle tinkling of tea spoons and musical clatter of cups and saucers and all mingled in a delightful dream of rest and eliza_harris slept as she had not slept before since the fearful midnight hour when she had taken her child and fled through the frosty starlight
she dreamed of a beautiful country a land it seemed to her of rest green shores pleasant islands and beautifully glittering water and there in a house which kind voice told her was a home
she heard her husband footsteps she felt him coming nearer his arm were around her his tear falling on her face and she awoke
the daylight had long faded her child lay calmly sleeping by her side a candle was burning dimly on the stand and her husband was sobbing by her pillow
she saw ruth husband come in saw she saw her boy playing free and happy child it was no dream the next morning was a cheerful one at the quaker house
mother was up betimes and surrounded by busy girl and boy whom we had scarce time to introduce to our readers yesterday and who all moved obediently to rachel_halliday gentle
in the work of getting breakfast for a breakfast in the luxurious valleys of indiana is a thing complicated and multiform and like picking up the rose leaves and trimming the bushes in paradise asking other hand than those of the original mother
while therefore john_bunyan ran to the spring for fresh water and simeon_halliday the second sifted meal for corn cakes and mary ground coffee
rachel_halliday moved gently and quietly about making biscuits cutting up chicken and diffusing a sort of sunny radiance over the whole proceeding generally
if there was any danger of friction or collision from the ill regulated zeal of so many young operators her gentle come
thee had better or more gentle hadnt thee better come or i wouldnt now was quite sufficient to allay the difficulty
we had rather for our part have the cestus of rachel_halliday that kept head from being turned and made everything go on harmoniously
bards have written of the cestus of venus that turned the head of all the world in successive generations we think it is more suited to our modern day decidedly
while all other preparations were going on simeon_halliday the elder stood in his shirt sleeves before a little looking glass in the corner engaged in the anti patriarchal operation of shaving
everything went on so sociably so quietly so harmoniously in the great kitchen it seemed so pleasant to every one to do just what they were doing there was such an atmosphere of mutual confidence and good fellowship everywhere even
the knives and forks had a social clatter as they went on to the table and the chicken and ham had a cheerful and joyous fizzle in the pan as if they rather enjoyed being cooked than otherwise and when george_harris and eliza_harris and little harry came out they met such a hearty rejoicing welcome no wonder it seemed to them like a dream
at last they were all seated at breakfast while mary stood at the stove baking griddle cakes which as they gained the true exact golden brown tint of perfection were transferred quite handily to the table
there was so much motherliness and full heartedness even in the way she passed a plate of cakes or poured a cup of coffee that it seemed to put a spirit into the food and drink she offered
it was the first time that ever george_harris had sat down on equal terms at any white man table and he sat down at first with some constraint and awkwardness but they all exhaled and went off like fog in the genial morning rays of this simple overflowing kindness
this indeed was a home home a word that george_harris had never yet known a meaning for and a belief in god and trust in his providence began to encircle his heart as with a golden cloud of protection and confidence dark misanthropic pining atheistic doubts and fierce despair melted away before the light of a living gospel breathed in living face preached by a thousand unconscious acts of love and good will which like the cup of cold water given in the name of a disciple shall never lose their reward
rachel_halliday never looked so truly and benignly happy as at the head of her table father what if thee should get found out again said simeon_halliday second as he buttered his cake
i should pay my fine said simeon_halliday quietly but what if they put thee in prison couldnt thee and mother manage the farm said simeon_halliday smiling
mother can do almost everything said the boy but isnt it a shame to make such law thee mustnt speak evil of thy rulers simeon_halliday said his father gravely
the lord only gives us our worldly goods that we may do justice and mercy if our rulers require a price of us for it we must deliver it up
well i hate those old slaveholders said the boy who felt as unchristian as became any modern reformer
i would do even the same for the slaveholder as for the slave if the lord brought him to my door in affliction
simeon_halliday second blushed scarlet but his mother only smiled and said simeon_halliday is my good boy he will grow older by and by and then he will be like his father
i am surprised at thee son said simeon_halliday thy mother never taught thee so i hope my good sir that you are not exposed to any difficulty on our account said george_harris anxiously
fear nothing george_harris for therefore are we sent into the world if we would not meet trouble for a good cause we were not worthy of our name
but for me said george_harris i could not bear it fear not then friend george_harris it is not for thee but for god and man we do it said simeon_halliday
and now thou must lie by quietly this day and tonight at ten clock phineas_fletcher will carry thee onward to the next stand thee and the rest of thy company
the pursuers are hard after thee we must not delay if that is the case why wait till evening said george_harris
thou art safe here by daylight for every one in the settlement is a friend and all are watching it has been found safer to travel by night
chapter xiv evangeline a young star which shone er life too sweet an image for such glass a lovely being scarcely formed or moulded a rose with all its sweetest leaves yet folded
how as by an enchanted wand have its scenes been changed since chateaubriand wrote his prose poetic description of it as a river of mighty unbroken solitudes rolling amid undreamed wonders of vegetable and animal existence
in atala or the love and constantcy of two savages in the desert by francois auguste rene vicomte de chateaubriand
but as in an hour this river of dreams and wild romance has emerged to a reality scarcely less visionary and splendid
what other river of the world bears on its bosom to the ocean the wealth and enterprise of such another country a country whose products embrace all between the tropics and the poles
those turbid water hurrying foaming tearing along an apt resemblance of that headlong tide of business which is poured along its wave by a race more vehement and energetic than any the old world ever saw
would that they did not also bear along a more fearful freight the tear of the oppressed the sighs of the helpless the bitter prayers of poor ignorant heart to an unknown god unknown unseen and silent but who will yet come out of his place to save all the poor of the earth
the slanting light of the setting sun quivers on the sea like expanse of the river the shivery canes and the tall dark cypress hung with wreaths of dark funereal moss glow in the golden ray as the heavily laden steamboat marches onward
piled with cotton bales from many a plantation up over deck and side till she seems in the distance a square massive block of gray she moves heavily onward to the nearing mart
the mississippi ah we must look some time among its crowded decks before we shall find again our humble friend tom_loker
partly from confidence inspired by mr_shelby representations and partly from the remarkably inoffensive and quiet character of the man tom_loker had insensibly won his way far into the confidence even of such a man as mr_haley
at first he had watched him narrowly through the day and never allowed him to sleep at night unfettered but the uncomplaining patience and apparent contentment of tom_loker manner led him gradually to discontinue these restraints and for some time tom_loker had enjoyed a sort of parole of honor being permitted to come and go freely where he pleased on the boat
ever quiet and obliging and more than ready to lend a hand in every emergency which occurred among the workmen below he had won the good opinion of all the hand and spent many hour in helping them with as hearty a good will as ever he worked on a kentucky farm
when there seemed to be nothing for him to do he would climb to a nook among the cotton bales of the upper deck and busy himself in studying over his bible and
high on the upper deck in a little nook among the everywhere predominant cotton bales at last we may find him it is there
for a hundred or more miles above new orleans the river is higher than the surrounding country and rolls its tremendous volume between massive levees twenty foot in height
the traveller from the deck of the steamer as from some floating castle top overlooks the whole country for miles and miles around
tom_loker therefore had spread out full before him in plantation after plantation a map of the life to which he was approaching
he saw the distant slave at their toil he saw afar their villages of huts gleaming out in long rows on many a plantation distant from the stately mansions and pleasure grounds of the master and as the moving picture passed on his poor foolish heart would be turning backward to the kentucky farm with its old shadowy beeches to the master house with its wide cool halls and near by the little cabin overgrown with the multiflora and bignonia
there he seemed to see familiar face of comrades who had grown up with him from infancy he saw his busy wife bustling in her preparations for his evening meals he heard the merry laugh of his boy at their play and the chirrup of the baby at his knee and then with a start all faded and he saw again the canebrakes and cypresses and gliding plantation and heard again the creaking and groaning of the machinery all telling him too plainly that all that phase of life had gone by forever
in such a case you write to your wife and send messages to your child but tom_loker could not write the mail for him had no existence and the gulf of separation was unbridged by even a friendly word or signal
is it strange then that some tear fall on the pages of his bible as he lays it on the cotton bale and with patient finger threading his slow way from word to word traces out its promises
we see him now having learned late in life tom_loker was but a slow reader and passed on laboriously from verse to verse
one whose word like ingots of gold seem often to need to be weighed separately that the mind may take in their priceless value
fortunate for him was it that the book he was intent on was one which slow reading cannot injure nay let us follow him a moment as pointing to each word and pronouncing each half aloud he reads let not your heart be troubled
in my father house are many mansions i go to prepare a place for you cicero when he buried his darling and only daughter had a heart as full of honest grief as poor
only man but cicero could pause over no such sublime word of hope and look to no such future reunion and if he had seen them ten to one he would not have believed he must fill his head first with a thousand questions of authenticity of manuscript and correctness of translation
but to poor tom_loker there it lay just what he needed so evidently true and divine that the possibility of a question never entered his simple head
as for tom_loker bible though it had no annotations and helps in margin from learned commentators still it had been embellished with certain way marks and guide boards of tom_loker own invention and which helped him more than the most learned expositions could have done
it had been his custom to get the bible read to him by his master child in particular by young master george_harris and as they read he would designate by bold strong marks and dashes with pen and ink the passages which more particularly gratified his ear or affected his heart
his bible was thus marked through from one end to the other with a variety of styles and designations so he could in a moment seize upon his favorite passages without the labor of spelling out what lay between them and while it lay there before him every passage breathing of some old home scene and recalling some past enjoyment his bible seemed to him all of this life that remained as well as the promise of a future one
among the passengers on the boat was a young gentleman of fortune and family resident in new orleans who bore the name of augustine_st_clare
he had with him a daughter between five and six year of age together with a lady who seemed to claim relationship to both and to have the little one especially under her charge
tom_loker perhaps no fuller for both were it must be true for if not true how could he live tom_loker had often caught glimpses of this little girl for
that can be no more contained in one place than a sunbeam or a summer breeze nor was she one that once seen could be easily forgotten
she was one of those busy tripping creature her form was the perfection of childish beauty without its usual chubbiness and squareness of outline
there was about it an undulating and aerial grace such as one might dream of for some mythic and allegorical being
her face was remarkable less for its perfect beauty of feature than for a singular and dreamy earnestness of expression which made the ideal start when they looked at her and by which the dullest and most literal were impressed without exactly knowing why
the shape of her head and the turn of her neck and bust was peculiarly noble and the long golden brown hair that floated like a cloud around it the deep spiritual gravity of her violet blue eye shaded by heavy fringes of golden brown all marked her out from other child and made every one turn and look after her as she glided hither and thither on the boat
on the contrary an airy and innocent playfulness seemed to flicker like the shadow of summer leaves over her childish face and around her buoyant figure
she was always in motion always with a half smile on her rosy mouth flying hither and thither with an undulating and cloud like tread singing to herself as she moved as in a happy dream
her father and female guardian were incessantly busy in pursuit of her but when caught she melted from them again like a summer cloud and as no word of chiding or reproof ever fell on her ear for whatever she chose to do she pursued her own way all over the boat
always dressed in white she seemed to move like a shadow through all sort of place without contracting spot or stain and there was not a corner or nook above or below where those fairy footsteps had not glided and that visionary golden head with its deep blue eye fleeted along
the fireman as he looked up from his sweaty toil sometimes found those eye looking wonderingly into the raging depths of the furnace and fearfully and pityingly at him as if she thought him in some dreadful danger
anon the steersman at the wheel paused and smiled as the picture like head gleamed through the window of the round house and in a moment was gone again
a thousand time a day rough voice blessed her and smiles of unwonted softness stole over hard face as she passed and when she tripped fearlessly over dangerous place rough sooty hand were stretched involuntarily out to save her and smooth her path
tom_loker who had the soft impressible nature of his kindly race ever yearning toward the simple and childlike watched the little creature with daily increasing interest
to him she seemed something almost divine and whenever her golden head and deep blue eye peered out upon him from behind some dusky cotton bale or looked down upon him over some ridge of packages he half believed that he saw one of the angels stepped out of his new testament
nevertheless the little one was not what you would have called either a grave child or a sad one often and often she walked mournfully round the place where mr_haley gang of man and woman sat in their chains
she would glide in among them and look at them with an air of perplexed and sorrowful earnestness and sometimes she would lift their chains with her slender hand and then sigh wofully as she glided away
several time she appeared suddenly among them with her hand full of candy nuts and oranges which she would distribute joyfully to them and then be gone again
he knew an abundance of simple acts to propitiate and invite the approaches of the little people and he resolved to play his part right skilfully
he could cut cunning little baskets out of cherry stones could make grotesque face on hickory nuts or odd jumping figures out of elder pith and he was a very pan in the manufacture of whistles of all sizes and sort
his pocket were full of miscellaneous articles of attraction which he had hoarded in day of old for his master child and which he now produced with commendable prudence and economy one by one as overtures for acquaintance and friendship
the little one was shy for all her busy interest in everything going on and it was not easy to tame her
for a while she would perch like a canary mrs_bird on some box or package near tom_loker while busy in the little arts afore named and take from him with a kind of grave bashfulness the little articles he offered
tom_loker watched the little lady a great deal before he ventured on any overtures towards acquaintanceship but at last they got on quite confidential terms
what little missy name said tom_loker at last when he thought matter were ripe to push such an inquiry
evangeline augustine_st_clare said the little one though papa and everybody else call me miss_eva now what your name my name tom_loker
the little chil en used to call me uncle tom_loker way back thar in kentuck then i mean to call you uncle tom_loker because you see i like you said miss_eva
so uncle tom_loker where are you going i dont know miss_eva dont know said miss_eva no i am going to be sold to somebody
i dont know who my papa can buy you said miss_eva quickly and if he buys you you will have good time
the boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood and miss_eva hearing her father voice bounded nimbly away
i mean to ask him this very day thank you my little lady said tom_loker tom rose up and went forward to offer his service in wooding and soon was busy among the hand
miss_eva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the boat start from the landing place the wheel had made two or three revolutions in the water when by some sudden movement the little one suddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into the water
her father scarce knowing what he did was plunging in after her but was held back by some behind him who saw that more efficient aid had followed his child
tom_loker was standing just under her on the lower deck as she fell he saw her strike the water and sink and was after her in a moment
a broad chested strong armed fellow it was nothing for him to keep afloat in the water till in a moment or two the child rose to the surface and he caught her in his arm and swimming with her to the boat side handed her up all dripping to the grasp of hundreds of hand which as if they had all belonged to one man were stretched eagerly out to receive her
a few moment more and her father bore her dripping and senseless to the lady cabin where as is usual in case of the kind there ensued a very well meaning and kind hearted strife among the female occupants generally as to who should do the most thing to make a disturbance and to hinder her recovery in every way possible
a general bustle of expectation and preparation was spread through the boat in the cabin one and another were gathering their thing together and arranging them preparatory to going ashore
the steward and chambermaid and all were busily engaged in cleaning furbishing and arranging the splendid boat preparatory to a grand entree
on the lower deck sat our friend tom_loker with his arm folded and anxiously from time to time turning his eye towards a group on the other side of the boat
there stood the fair evangeline a little paler than the day before but otherwise exhibiting no traces of the accident which had befallen her
a graceful elegantly formed young man stood by her carelessly leaning one elbow on a bale of cotton while a large pocket book lay open before him
it was a sultry close day the next day as the steamer drew near to new orleans it was quite evident at a glance that the gentleman was miss_eva father
there was the same noble cast of head the same large blue eye the same golden brown hair yet the expression was wholly different
in the large clear blue eye though in form and color exactly similar there was wanting that misty dreamy depth of expression all was clear bold and bright but with a light wholly of this world the beautifully cut mouth had a proud and somewhat sarcastic expression while an air of free and easy superiority sat not ungracefully in every turn and movement of his fine form
he was listening with a good humored negligent air half comic half contemptuous to mr_haley who was very volubly expatiating on the quality of the article for which they were bargaining
well now my good fellow what the damage as they say in kentucky in short what to be paid out for this business
all the moral and christian virtues bound in black morocco complete he said when mr_haley had finished how much are you going to cheat me now
out with it wal said mr_haley if i should say thirteen hundred dollar for that ar fellow i shouldnt but just save myself
i shouldnt now re ly poor fellow said the young man fixing his keen mocking blue eye on him but i suppose you let me have him for that out of a particular regard for me
well the young lady here seems to be sot on him and nat lly enough certainly there a call on your benevolence my friend
now as a matter of christian charity how cheap could you afford to let him go to oblige a young lady that particular sot on him
wal now just think ont said the trader just look at them limbs broad chested strong as a horse look at his head them high forrads allays shows calculatin nigger that ll do any kind thing
now a nigger of that ar heft and build is worth considerable just as you may say for his body supposin he stupid but come to put in his calculatin faculties and them which i can show he has oncommon why of course it makes him come higher
bad bad very bad knows altogether too much said the young man with the same mocking smile playing about his mouth
i ve marked that ar why that ar fellow managed his master whole farm he has a strornary talent for business
never will do in the world your smart fellow are always running off stealing horse and raising the devil generally i think you ll have to take off a couple of hundred for his smartness
wal there might be something in that ar if it warnt for his character but i can show recommends from his master and others to prove he is one of your real pious the most humble prayin pious crittur ye ever did see
why he been called a preacher in them part he came from and i might use him for a family chaplain possibly added the young man dryly
that quite an idea religion is a remarkably scarce article at our house you re joking now how do you know i am
didnt you just warrant him for a preacher has he been examined by any synod or council come hand over your paper
if the trader had not been sure by a certain good humored twinkle in the large eye that all this banter was sure in the long run to turn out a cash concern he might have been somewhat out of patience as it was he laid down a greasy pocket book on the cotton bales and began anxiously studying over certain paper in it the young man standing by the while looking down on him with an air of careless easy drollery
it no matter what you pay whispered miss_eva softly getting up on a package and putting her arm around her father neck
papa do buy him you have money enough i know i want him what for pussy are you going to use him for a rattle box or a rocking horse or what
here the trader handed up a certificate signed by mr_shelby which the young man took with the tips of his long fingers and glanced over carelessly
i want to make him happy an original reason certainly a gentlemanly hand he said and well spelt too
well now but i not sure after all about this religion said he the old wicked expression returning to his eye the country is almost ruined with pious white people such pious politicians as we have just before elections such pious goings on in all departments of church and state that a fellow does not know who ll cheat him next
i dont know either about religion being up in the market just now i have not looked in the paper lately to see how it sells
how many hundred dollar now do you put on for this religion you like to be jokin now said the trader
but then there sense under all that ar i know there differences in religion some kind is mis rable there your meetin pious there your singin roarin pious them ar ant no account in black
white but these rayly is and i ve seen it in nigger as often as any your rail softly quiet stiddy honest pious that the hull world couldnt tempt em to do nothing that they thinks is wrong and ye see in this letter what tom_loker old master says about him
now said the young man stooping gravely over his book of bills if you can assure me that i really can buy this kind of pious and that it will be set down to my account in the book up above as something belonging to me i wouldnt care if i did go a little extra for it
or how ye say wal raily i cant do that said the trader i a thinkin that every man ll have to hang on his own hook in them ar quarters
rather hard on a fellow that pays extra on religion and cant trade with it in the state where he wants it most an t
it now said the young man who had been making out a roll of bills while he was speaking
all right said mr_haley his face beaming with delight and pulling out an old inkhorn he proceeded to fill out a bill of sale which in a few moment he handed to the young man
i wonder now if i was divided up and inventoried said the latter as he ran over the paper how much i might bring
say so much for the shape of my head so much for a high forehead so much for arm and hand and legs and then so much for education learning talent honesty religion
there count your money old boy he added as he handed the roll to the trader bless me
but come miss_eva he said and taking the hand of his daughter he stepped across the boat and carelessly putting the tip of his finger under tom_loker chin said good humoredly look up tom_loker and see how you like your new master
it was not in nature to look into that gay young handsome face without a feeling of pleasure and tom_loker felt the tear start in his eye as he said heartily god bless you mas
there would be small charge on that last i thinking tom_loker looked up well i hope he will what your name
tom_loker quite as likely to do it for your asking as mine from all accounts can you drive horse tom_loker
well i think i shall put you in coachy on condition that you wont be drunk more than once a week unless in case of emergency tom_loker
i ve been allays used to horse said tom_loker mas mr_shelby raised heaps of em tom_loker looked surprised and rather hurt and said i never drink mas
i ve heard that story before tom_loker but then we ll see it will be a special accommodation to all concerned if you dont
never mind my boy he added good humoredly seeing tom_loker still looked grave i dont doubt you mean to do well
i sartin do mas said tom_loker and you shall have good time said miss_eva papa is very good to everybody only he always will laugh at them
papa is much obliged to you for his recommendation said augustine_st_clare laughing as he turned on his heel and walked away
since the thread of our humble hero life has now become interwoven with that of higher one it is necessary to give some brief introduction to them
chapter xv of tom_loker new master and various other matter augustine_st_clare was the son of a wealthy planter of louisiana
of two brothers very similar in temperament and character one had settled on a flourishing farm in vermont and the other became an opulent planter in louisiana
the mother of augustine_st_clare was a huguenot french lady whose family had emigrated to louisiana during the day of its early settlement
having inherited from his mother an exceeding delicacy of constitution he was at the instance of physicians during many year of his boyhood sent to the care of his uncle in vermont in order that his constitution might be strengthened by the cold of a more bracing climate
in childhood he was remarkable for an extreme and marked sensitiveness of character more akin to the softness of woman than the ordinary hardness of his own sex
time however overgrew this softness with the rough bark of manhood and but few knew how living and fresh it still lay at the core
his talents were of the very first order although his mind showed a preference always for the ideal and the aesthetic and there was about him that repugnance to the actual business of life which is the common result of this balance of the faculties
soon after the completion of his college course his whole nature was kindled into one intense and passionate effervescence of romantic passion
his hour came the hour that comes only once his star rose in the horizon that star that rises so often in vain to be remembered only as a thing of dreams and it rose for him in vain
to drop the figure he saw and won the love of a high minded and beautiful woman in one of the northern state and they were affianced
he returned south to make arrangements for their marriage when most unexpectedly his letter were returned to him by mail with a short note from her guardian stating to him that ere this reached him the lady would be the wife of another
stung to madness he vainly hoped as many another has done to fling the whole thing from his heart by one desperate effort
too proud to supplicate or seek explanation he threw himself at once into a whirl of fashionable society and in a fortnight from the time of the fatal letter was the accepted lover of the reigning belle of the season and as soon as arrangements could be made he became the husband of a fine figure a pair of bright dark eye and a hundred thousand dollar and of course everybody thought him a happy fellow
the married couple were enjoying their honeymoon and entertaining a brilliant circle of friend in their splendid villa near lake pontchartrain when one day a letter was brought to him in that well remembered writing
it was handed to him while he was in full tide of gay and successful conversation in a whole room full of company
he turned deadly pale when he saw the writing but still preserved his composure and finished the playful warfare of badinage which he was at the moment carrying on with a lady opposite and a short time after was missed from the circle
the family had its origin in canada augustine_st_clare and another brother were the only child of their parents in his room alone he opened and read the letter now worse than idle and useless to be read
it was from her giving a long account of a persecution to which she had been exposed by her guardian family to lead her to unite herself with their son and she related how for a long time his letter had ceased to arrive how she had written time and again till she became weary and doubtful how her health had failed under her anxieties and how at last she had discovered the whole fraud which had been practised on them both
the letter ended with expression of hope and thankfulness and professions of undying affection which were more bitter than death to the unhappy young man
he wrote to her immediately i have received yours but too late i believed all i heard i was desperate i am married and all is over
only forget it is all that remains for either of us and thus ended the whole romance and ideal of life for augustine_st_clare
but the real remained the real like the flat bare oozy tide mud when the blue sparkling wave with all its company of gliding boat and white winged ships its music of oars and chiming water has gone down and there it lies flat slimy bare exceedingly real
of course in a novel people heart break and they die and that is the end of it and in a story this is very convenient
there is a most busy and important round of eating drinking dressing walking visiting buying selling talking reading and all that makes up what is commonly called living yet to be gone through and this yet remained to augustine_st_clare
had his wife been a whole woman she might yet have done something as woman can to mend the broken threads of life and weave again into a tissue of brightness
but in real life we do not die when all that makes life bright dies to us but marie_st_clare augustine_st_clare could not even see that they had been broken
as before stated she consisted of a fine figure a pair of splendid eye and a hundred thousand dollar and none of these items were precisely the one to minister to a mind diseased
when augustine_st_clare pale as death was found lying on the sofa and pleaded sudden sick headache as the cause of his distress she recommended to him to smell of hartshorn and when the paleness and headache came on week after week she only said that she never thought mr augustine_st_clare was sickly but it seems he was very liable to sick headaches and that it was a very unfortunate thing for her because he didnt enjoy going into company with her and it seemed odd to go so much alone when they were just married
augustine_st_clare was glad in his heart that he had married so undiscerning a woman but as the glosses and civilities of the honeymoon wore away he discovered that a beautiful young woman who has lived all her life to be caressed and waited on might prove quite a hard mistress in domestic life
marie_st_clare never had possessed much capability of affection or much sensibility and the little that she had had been merged into a most intense and unconscious selfishness a selfishness the more hopeless from its quiet obtuseness its utter ignorance of any claims but her own
from her infancy she had been surrounded with servant who lived only to study her caprices the idea that they had either feeling or rights had never dawned upon her even in distant perspective
her father whose only child she had been had never denied her anything that lay within the compass of human possibility and when she entered life beautiful accomplished and an heiress she had of course all the eligibles and non eligibles of the other sex sighing at her foot and she had no doubt that augustine_st_clare was a most fortunate man in having obtained her
it is a great mistake to suppose that a woman with no heart will be an easy creditor in the exchange of affection
there is not on earth a more merciless exactor of love from others than a thoroughly selfish woman and the more unlovely she grows
when therefore augustine_st_clare began to drop off those gallantries and small attentions which flowed at first through the habitude of courtship he found his sultana no way ready to resign her slave there were abundance of tear poutings and small tempests there were discontents pinings upbraidings
augustine_st_clare was good natured and self indulgent and sought to buy off with presents and flatteries and when marie_st_clare became mother to a beautiful daughter he really felt awakened for a time to something like tenderness
augustine_st_clare mother had been a woman of uncommon elevation and purity of character and he gave to his child his mother name fondly fancying that she would prove a reproduction of her image
the thing had been remarked with petulant jealousy by his wife and she regarded her husband absorbing devotion to the child with suspicion and dislike all that was given to her seemed so much taken from herself
the more jealously and scrupulously she exacts love to the uttermost farthing from the time of the birth of this child her health gradually sunk
a life of constant inaction bodily and mental the friction of ceaseless ennui and discontent united to the ordinary weakness which attended the period of maternity in course of a few year changed the blooming young belle into a yellow faded sickly woman whose time was divided among a variety of fanciful diseases and who considered herself in every sense the most ill used and suffering person in existence
there was no end of her various complaints but her principal forte appeared to lie in sick headache which sometimes would confine her to her room three day out of six
his only daughter was exceedingly delicate and he feared that with no one to look after her and attend to her her health and life might yet fall a sacrifice to her mother inefficiency
he had taken her with him on a tour to vermont and had persuaded his cousin miss_ophelia augustine_st_clare to return with him to his southern residence and they are now returning on this boat where we have introduced them to our readers
and now while the distant domes and spires of new orleans rise to our view there is yet time for an introduction to miss_ophelia
whoever has travelled in the new england state will remember in some cool village the large farmhouse with its clean swept grassy yard shaded by the dense and massive foliage of the sugar maple and remember the air of order and stillness of perpetuity and unchanging repose that seemed to breathe over the whole place
nothing lost or out of order not a picket loose in the fence not a particle of litter in the turfy yard with its clumps of lilac bushes growing up under the window
within he will remember wide clean room where nothing ever seems to be doing or going to be done where everything is once and forever rigidly in place and where all household arrangements move with the punctual exactness of the old clock in the corner
in the family keeping room as it is termed he will remember the staid respectable old book case with its glass door where rollin history
as of course all family arrangements fell into the hand of servant augustine_st_clare found his menage anything but comfortable milton paradise lost john_bunyan pilgrim progress and scott family bible
there are no servant in the house but the lady in the snowy cap with the spectacles who sits sewing every afternoon among her daughters as if nothing ever had been done or were to be done she and her girl in some long forgotten fore part of the day did up the work and for the rest of the time probably at all hour when you would see them it is done up
the old kitchen floor never seems stained or spotted the table the chair and the various cooking utensils never seem deranged or disordered though three and sometimes four meals a day are got there though the family washing and ironing is there performed and though pounds of butter and cheese are in some silent and mysterious manner there brought into existence
stand side by side in decorous order with multitudes of other book equally solemn and respectable the ancient history ten volumes by the french historian charles rollin
on such a farm in such a house and family miss_ophelia had spent a quiet existence of some forty five year when her cousin invited her to visit his southern mansion
the eldest of a large family she was still considered by her father and mother as one of the child and the proposal that she should go to orleans was a most momentous one to the family circle
the old gray headed father took down morse atlas out of the book case and looked out the exact latitude and longitude and read flint travels in the south and west
scott family bible edited with notes by the english biblical commentator thomas scott to make up his own mind as to the nature of the country
the cerographic atlas of the united state by sidney edwards morse son of the geographer jedidiah morse and brother of the painter inventor samuel b morse
recollections of the last ten year by timothy flint missionary of presbyterianism to the trans allegheny west
the good mother inquired anxiously if orleans wasnt an awful wicked place saying that it seemed to her most equal to going to the sandwich islands or anywhere among the heathen
it was known at the minister and at the doctor and at miss peabody milliner shop that miss_ophelia augustine_st_clare was talking about going away down to orleans with her cousin and of course the whole village could do no less than help this very important process of talking about the matter
the minister who inclined strongly to abolitionist views was quite doubtful whether such a step might not tend somewhat to encourage the southerners in holding on to their slave while the doctor who was a stanch colonizationist inclined to the opinion that miss_ophelia ought to go to show the orleans people that we dont think hardly of them after all
when however the fact that she had resolved to go was fully before the public mind she was solemnly invited out to tea by all her friend and neighbors for the space of a fortnight and her prospects and plans duly canvassed and inquired into
miss moseley who came into the house to help to do the dress making acquired daily accessions of importance from the developments with regard to miss_ophelia wardrobe which she had been enabled to make
it was credibly ascertained that squire sinclare as his name was commonly contracted in the neighborhood had counted out fifty dollar and given them to miss_ophelia and told her to buy any clothes she thought best and that two new silk dresses and a bonnet had been sent for from boston
as to the propriety of this extraordinary outlay the public mind was divided some affirming that it was well enough all thing considered for once in one life and others stoutly affirming that the money had better have been sent to the missionaries but all party agreed that there had been no such parasol seen in those part as had been sent on from new york and that she had one silk dress that might fairly be trusted to stand alone whatever might be said of its mistress
there were credible rumors also of a hemstitched pocket handkerchief and report even went so far as to state that miss_ophelia had one pocket handkerchief with lace all around it it was even added that it was worked in the corners but this latter point was never satisfactorily ascertained and remains in fact unsettled to this day
miss_ophelia as you now behold her stands before you in a very shining brown linen travelling dress tall square formed and angular
her face was thin and rather sharp in its outlines the lips compressed like those of a person who is in the habit of making up her mind definitely on all subjects while the keen dark eye had a peculiarly searching advised movement and travelled over everything as if they were looking for something to take care of
all her movements were sharp decided and energetic and though she was never much of a talker her word were remarkably direct and to the purpose when she did speak
he was of opinion in fact that southern people needed encouraging in her habits she was a living impersonation of order method and exactness
in punctuality she was as inevitable as a clock and as inexorable as a railroad engine and she held in most decided contempt and abomination anything of a contrary character
the great sin of sins in her eye the sum of all evils was expressed by one very common and important word in her vocabulary shiftlessness
her finale and ultimatum of contempt consisted in a very emphatic pronunciation of the word shiftless and by this she characterized all modes of procedure which had not a direct and inevitable relation to accomplishment of some purpose then definitely had in mind
people who did nothing or who did not know exactly what they were going to do or who did not take the most direct way to accomplish what they set their hand to were objects of her entire contempt a contempt shown less frequently by anything she said than by a kind of stony grimness as if she scorned to say anything about the matter
as to mental cultivation she had a clear strong active mind was well and thoroughly read in history and the older english classics and thought with great strength within certain narrow limits
her theological tenets were all made up labelled in most positive and distinct form and put by like the bundles in her patch trunk there were just so many of them and there were never to be any more
so also were her ideas with regard to most matter of practical life such as housekeeping in all its branches and the various political relations of her native village
and underlying all deeper than anything else higher and broader lay the strongest principle of her being conscientiousness nowhere is conscience so dominant and all absorbing as with new england woman
it is the granite formation which lies deepest and rises out even to the tops of the highest mountains miss_ophelia was the absolute bond slave of the ought
once make her certain that the path of duty as she commonly phrased it lay in any given direction and fire and water could not keep her from it
she would walk straight down into a well or up to a loaded cannon mouth if she were only quite sure that there the path lay
her standard of right was so high so all embracing so minute and making so few concessions to human frailty that though she strove with heroic ardor to reach it she never actually did so and of course was burdened with a constant and often harassing sense of deficiency this
gave a severe and somewhat gloomy cast to her religious character but how in the world can miss_ophelia get along with augustine_st_clare gay easy unpunctual unpractical
sceptical in short walking with impudent and nonchalant freedom over every one of her most cherished habits and opinions to tell the truth then miss_ophelia loved him
when a boy it had been hers to teach him his catechism mend his clothes comb his hair and bring him up generally in the way he should go and her heart having a warm side to it augustine_st_clare had as he usually did with most people monopolized a large share of it for himself and therefore it was that he succeeded very easily in persuading her that the path of duty lay in the direction of new orleans and that she must go with him to take care of miss_eva and keep everything from going to wreck and ruin during the frequent illnesses of his wife
the idea of a house without anybody to take care of it went to her heart then she loved the lovely little girl as few could help doing and though she regarded augustine_st_clare as very much of a heathen yet she loved him laughed at his jokes and forbore with his failings to an extent which those who knew him thought perfectly incredible
there she is sitting now in her state room surrounded by a mixed multitude of little and big carpet bags boxes baskets each containing some separate responsibility which she is tying binding up packing or fastening with a face of great earnestness
but what more or other is to be known of miss_ophelia our reader must discover by a personal acquaintance
now miss_eva have you kept count of your thing of course you havent child never do there the spotted carpet bag and the little blue band box with your best
then the india rubber satchel is three and my tape and needle box is four and my band box five and my collar box and that little hair trunk seven
give it to me and let me put a paper round it and tie it to my umbrella with my shade there now
bonnet that two what have you done with your sunshade why aunty we are only going up home what is the use
to keep it nice child people must take care of their thing if they ever mean to have anything and now miss_eva is your thimble put up
really aunty i dont know well never mind i ll look your box over thimble wax two spools scissors knife tape needle all right put it in here
what did you ever do child when you were coming on with only your papa i should have thought you a lost everything you had
well aunty i did lose a great many and then when we stopped anywhere papa would buy some more of whatever it was
mercy on us child what a way it was a very easy way aunty said miss_eva it a dreadful shiftless one said aunty
it must shut down said aunty with the air of a general as she squeezed the thing in and sprung upon the lid still a little gap remained about the mouth of the trunk
why aunty what ll you do now said miss_eva that trunk is too full to be shut down get up here miss_eva said miss_ophelia courageously what has been done can be done again
this trunk has got to be shut and locked there are no two way about it and the trunk intimidated doubtless by this resolute statement gave in
the hasp snapped sharply in its hole and miss_ophelia turned the key and pocketed it in triumph now we re ready
where your papa i think it time this baggage was set out do look out miss_eva and see if you see your papa
yes he down the other end of the gentleman cabin eating an orange he cant know how near we are coming said aunty hadnt you better run and speak to him
papa never is in a hurry about anything said miss_eva and we havent come to the landing do step on the guards aunty
the boat now began with heavy groans like some vast tired monster to prepare to push up among the multiplied steamers at the levee
look there our house up that street miss_eva joyously pointed out the various spires domes and way marks by which she recognized her native city
yes yes dear very fine said miss_ophelia but mercy on us the boat has stopped where is your father
and now ensued the usual turmoil of landing waiters running twenty way at once man tugging trunks carpet bags boxes woman anxiously calling to their child and
miss_ophelia seated herself resolutely on the lately vanquished trunk and marshalling all her goods and chattels in fine military order seemed resolved to defend them to the last
everybody crowding in a dense mass to the plank towards the landing shall i take your trunk ma am
shall i take your baggage let me tend to your baggage missis shant i carry out these yer missis rained down upon her unheeded
she sat with grim determination upright as a darning needle stuck in a board holding on her bundle of umbrella and parasols and replying with a determination that was enough to strike dismay even into a hackman wondering to miss_eva in each interval what upon earth her papa could be thinking of he couldnt have fallen over now but something must have happened and just as she had begun to work herself into a real distress he came up with his usually careless motion and giving miss_eva a quarter of the orange he was eating said well cousin vermont i suppose you are all ready
i ve been ready waiting nearly an hour said miss_ophelia i began to be really concerned about you that a clever fellow now said he
well the carriage is waiting and the crowd are now off so that one can walk out in a decent and christian manner and not be pushed and shoved
here he added to a driver who stood behind him take these thing i ll go and see to his putting them in said miss_ophelia
well at any rate i ll carry this and this and this said miss_ophelia singling out three boxes and a small carpet bag
pshaw cousin what the use said augustine_st_clare my dear miss vermont positively you mustnt come the green mountains over us that way
they ll take you for a waiting maid give them to this fellow he ll put them down as if they were eggs now
miss_ophelia looked despairingly as her cousin took all her treasures from her and rejoiced to find herself once more in the carriage with them in a state of preservation
you must adopt at least a piece of a southern principle and not walk out under all that load
i going to take tom_loker up to mother for a peace offering to make up for that drunken fellow that upset the carriage
where tom_loker said miss_eva he on the outside pussy tom_loker will make a splendid driver i know said miss_eva he ll never get drunk
the carriage stopped in front of an ancient mansion built in that odd mixture of spanish and french style of which there are specimens in some part of new orleans
it was built in the moorish fashion a square building enclosing a court yard into which the carriage drove through an arched gateway
wide galleries ran all around the four side whose moorish arches slender pillars and arabesque ornaments carried the mind back as in a dream to the reign of oriental romance in spain
in the middle of the court a fountain threw high its silvery water falling in a never ceasing spray into a marble basin fringed with a deep border of fragrant violets
the water in the fountain pellucid as crystal was alive with myriads of gold and silver fishes twinkling and darting through it like so many living jewels
around the fountain ran a walk paved with a mosaic of pebbles laid in various fanciful patterns and this again was surrounded by turf smooth as green velvet while a carriage drive enclosed the whole
two large orange trees now fragrant with blossoms threw a delicious shade and ranged in a circle round upon the turf were marble vases of arabesque sculpture containing the choicest flowering plants of the tropics
huge pomegranate trees with their glossy leaves and flame colored flowers dark leaved arabian jessamines with their silvery stars geraniums luxuriant roses bending beneath their heavy abundance of flowers golden jessamines lemon scented verbenum all united their bloom and fragrance while here and there a mystic old aloe with its strange massive leaves
the court in the inside had evidently been arranged to gratify a picturesque and voluptuous ideality sat looking like some old enchanter sitting in weird grandeur among the more perishable bloom and fragrance around it
the galleries that surrounded the court were festooned with a curtain of some kind of moorish stuff and could be drawn down at pleasure to exclude the beams of the sun
as the carriage drove in miss_eva seemed like a mrs_bird ready to burst from a cage with the wild eagerness of her delight
on the whole the appearance of the place was luxurious and romantic isnt it beautiful lovely my own dear darling home
t is a pretty place said miss_ophelia as she alighted though it looks rather old and heathenish to me
she said to miss_ophelia isnt it beautiful tom_loker got down from the carriage and looked about with an air of calm still enjoyment
the negro it must be remembered is an exotic of the most gorgeous and superb country of the world and he has deep in his heart a passion for all that is splendid rich and fanciful a passion which rudely indulged by an untrained taste draws on them the ridicule of the colder and more correct white race
augustine_st_clare who was in heart a poetical voluptuary smiled as miss_ophelia made her remark on his premises and turning to tom_loker who was standing looking round his beaming black face perfectly radiant with admiration he said tom_loker my boy this seems to suit you
all this passed in a moment while trunks were being hustled off hackman paid and while a crowd of all ages and sizes man woman and child came running through the galleries both above and below to see mas come in
foremost among them was a highly dressed young mulatto man evidently a very distingue personage attired in the ultra extreme of the mode and gracefully waving a scented cambric handkerchief in his hand
this personage had been exerting himself with great alacrity in driving all the flock of domestics to the other end of the verandah
yes mas it looks about the right thing said tom_loker back all of you i am ashamed of you he said in a tone of authority
all looked abashed at this elegant speech delivered with quite an air and stood huddled together at a respectful distance except two stout porters who came up and began conveying away the baggage
owing to mr_adolph systematic arrangements when augustine_st_clare turned round from paying the hackman there was nobody in view but mr_adolph himself conspicuous in satin vest gold guard chain and white pants and bowing with inexpressible grace and suavity
ah mr_adolph is it you said his master offering his hand to him how are you boy while mr_adolph poured forth with great fluency an extemporary speech which he had been preparing with great care for a fortnight before
would you intrude on master domestic relations in the first hour of his return well well said augustine_st_clare passing on with his usual air of negligent drollery that very well got up mr_adolph
i ll come to the people in a minute and so saying he led miss_ophelia to a large parlor that opened on the verandah
while this had been passing miss_eva had flown like a mrs_bird through the porch and parlor to a little boudoir opening likewise on the verandah
see that the baggage is well bestowed a tall dark eyed sallow woman half rose from a couch on which she was reclining
mamma said miss_eva in a sort of a rapture throwing herself on her neck and embracing her over and over again
that ll do take care child dont you make my head ache said the mother after she had languidly kissed her augustine_st_clare came in embraced his wife in true orthodox husbandly fashion and then presented to her his cousin
a crowd of servant now pressed to the entry door and among them a middle aged mulatto woman of very respectable appearance stood foremost in a tremor of expectation and joy at the door
marie_st_clare lifted her large eye on her cousin with an air of some curiosity and received her with languid politeness
o there mammy said miss_eva as she flew across the room and throwing herself into her arm she kissed her repeatedly
this woman did not tell her that she made her head ache but on the contrary she hugged her and laughed and cried till her sanity was a thing to be doubted of and when released from her miss_eva flew from one to another shaking hand and kissing in a way that miss_ophelia afterwards declared fairly turned her stomach
well said miss_ophelia you southern child can do something that i couldnt what now pray said augustine_st_clare
well i want to be kind to everybody and i wouldnt have anything hurt but as to kissing nigger said augustine_st_clare that you re not up to hey
yes that it how can she augustine_st_clare laughed as he went into the passage halloa here what to pay out here
here you all mammy jimmy polly sukey glad to see mas he said as he went shaking hand from one to another
look out for the babies he added as he stumbled over a sooty little urchin who was crawling upon all fours
if i step upon anybody let em mention it there was an abundance of laughing and blessing mas as augustine_st_clare distributed small pieces of change among them
come now take yourselves off like good boy and girl he said and the whole assemblage dark and light disappeared through a door into a large verandah followed by miss_eva who carried a large satchel which she had been filling with apples nuts candy ribbons laces and toys of every description during her whole homeward journey
as augustine_st_clare turned to go back his eye fell upon tom_loker who was standing uneasily shifting from one foot to the other while mr_adolph stood negligently leaning against the banisters examining tom_loker through an opera glass with an air that would have done credit to any dandy living
puh you puppy said his master striking down the opera glass is that the way you treat your company
seems to me dolph he added laying his finger on the elegant figured satin vest that mr_adolph was sporting seems to me that my vest
master this vest all stained with wine of course a gentleman in master standing never wears a vest like this
i understood i was to take it it does for a poor nigger fellow like me and mr_adolph tossed his head and passed his fingers through his scented hair with a grace
well here i going to show this tom_loker to his mistress and then you take him to the kitchen and mind you dont put on any of your air to him
so that it is it said augustine_st_clare carelessly he worth two such puppies as you master always will have his joke said mr_adolph laughing
he looked wistfully on the velvet carpets and the before unimagined splendors of mirrors pictures statues and curtains and like the queen of sheba before solomon there was no more spirit in him
i delighted to see master in such spirit here tom_loker said augustine_st_clare beckoning tom_loker entered the room he looked afraid even to set his foot down
i tell you he a regular hearse for blackness and sobriety and will drive you like a funeral if you want
see here marie_st_clare said augustine_st_clare to his wife i ve bought you a coachman at last to order open your eye now and look at him
now dont say i never think about you when i gone marie_st_clare opened her eye and fixed them on tom_loker without rising
i know he ll get drunk she said no he warranted a pious and sober article well i hope he may turn out well said the lady it more than i expect though
dolph said augustine_st_clare show tom_loker down stairs and mind yourself he added remember what i told you mr_adolph tripped gracefully forward and tom_loker with lumbering tread went after
come now marie_st_clare said augustine_st_clare seating himself on a stool beside her sofa be gracious and say something pretty to a fellow
he a perfect behemoth said marie_st_clare you ve been gone a fortnight beyond the time said the lady pouting
well you know i wrote you the reason such a short cold letter said the lady dear me the mail was just going and it had to be that or nothing
that just the way always said the lady always something to make your journeys long and letter short
see here now he added drawing an elegant velvet case out of his pocket and opening it here a present i got for you in new york
it was a daguerreotype clear and soft as an engraving representing miss_eva and her father sitting hand in hand marie_st_clare looked at it with a dissatisfied air
what made you sit in such an awkward position she said well the position may be a matter of opinion but what do you think of the likeness
if you dont think anything of my opinion in one case i suppose you wouldnt in another said the lady shutting the daguerreotype
hang the woman said augustine_st_clare mentally but aloud he added come now marie_st_clare what do you think of the likeness
dont be nonsensical now it very inconsiderate of you augustine_st_clare said the lady to insist on my talking and looking at thing
you know i ve been lying all day with the sick headache and there been such a tumult made ever since you came i half dead
you re subject to the sick headache ma am said miss_ophelia suddenly rising from the depths of the large arm chair where she had sat quietly taking an inventory of the furniture and calculating its expense
juniper berry tea is good for sick headache said miss_ophelia at least auguste deacon abraham perry wife used to say so and she was a great nurse
i ll have the first juniper berries that get ripe in our garden by the lake brought in for that special purpose said augustine_st_clare gravely pulling the bell as he did so meanwhile cousin you must be wanting to retire to your apartment and refresh yourself a little after your journey
yes i a perfect martyr to it said the lady dolph he added tell mammy to come here
the decent mulatto woman whom miss_eva had caressed so rapturously soon entered she was dressed neatly with a high red and yellow turban on her head the recent gift of miss_eva and which the child had been arranging on her head
mammy said augustine_st_clare i put this lady under your care she is tired and wants rest take her to her chamber and be sure she is made comfortable and miss_ophelia disappeared in the rear of mammy
here is our practical business like new england cousin who will take the whole budget of care off your shoulders and give you time to refresh yourself and grow young and handsome
chapter xvi tom_loker mistress and her opinions and now marie_st_clare said augustine_st_clare your golden day are dawning the ceremony of delivering the keys had better come off forthwith
this remark was made at the breakfast table a few morning after miss_ophelia had arrived i sure she welcome said marie_st_clare leaning her head languidly on her hand
i think she ll find one thing if she does and that is that it we mistress that are the slave down here
certainly she will discover that and a world of wholesome truths besides no doubt said augustine_st_clare talk about our keeping slave as if we did it for our convenience said marie_st_clare
evangeline fixed her large serious eye on her mother face with an earnest and perplexed expression and said simply what do you keep them for mamma
i sure if we consulted that we might let them all go at once i dont know i sure except for a plague they are the plague of my life
i believe that more of my ill health is caused by them than by any one thing and ours i know are the very worst that ever anybody was plagued with
come marie_st_clare you ve got the blues this morning said augustine_st_clare you knowt isnt so there mammy the best creature living what could you do without her
mammy is the best i ever knew said marie_st_clare and yet mammy now is selfish dreadfully selfish it the fault of the whole race
well now there mammy said marie_st_clare i think it selfish of her to sleep so sound night she knows i need little attentions almost every hour when my worst turns are on and yet she so hard to wake
selfishness is a dreadful fault said augustine_st_clare gravely i absolutely am worse this very morning for the efforts i had to make to wake her last night
hasnt she sat up with you a good many night lately mamma said miss_eva how should you know that said marie_st_clare sharply she been complaining i suppose
why dont you let jane or miss_rosa take her place a night or two said augustine_st_clare and let her rest
she didnt complain she only told me what bad night you had so many in succession how can you propose it said marie_st_clare
so nervous as i am the least breath disturbs me and a strange hand about me would drive me absolutely frantic
augustine_st_clare you really are inconsiderate if mammy felt the interest in me she ought to she wake easier of course she would
miss_ophelia had listened to this conversation with an air of shrewd observant gravity and she still kept her lips tightly compressed as if determined fully to ascertain her longitude and position before she committed herself
i ve heard of people who had such devoted servant but it never was my luck and marie_st_clare sighed now mammy has a sort of goodness said marie_st_clare she smooth and respectful but she selfish at heart
you see when i was married and came to live here of course i had to bring her with me and her husband my father couldnt spare
he was a blacksmith and of course very necessary and i thought and said at the time that mammy and he had better give each other up as it wasnt likely to be convenient for them ever to live together again
i wish now i insisted on it and married mammy to somebody else but i was foolish and indulgent and didnt want to insist
i told mammy at the time that she mustnt ever expect to see him more than once or twice in her life again for the air of father place doesnt agree with my health and i cant go there and i advised her to take up with somebody else but no she wouldnt
now she never will be done fidgeting and worrying about that husband of hers mammy has a kind of obstinacy about her in spots that everybody dont see as i do
has she child said miss_ophelia yes she has two i suppose she feels the separation from them
they were little dirty thing i couldnt have them about and besides they took up too much of her time but i believe that mammy has always kept up a sort of sulkiness about this
she wont marry anybody else and i do believe now though she knows how necessary she is to me and how feeble my health is she would go back to her husband tomorrow if she only could
well of course i couldnt bring them i do indeed said marie_st_clare they are just so selfish now the best of them
miss_ophelia looked keenly at him and saw the flush of mortification and repressed vexation and the sarcastic curl of the lip as he spoke
it distressing to reflect upon said augustine_st_clare dryly now mammy has always been a pet with me said marie_st_clare
i wish some of your northern servant could look at her closets of dresses silks and muslins and one real linen cambric she has hanging there
i ve worked sometimes whole afternoons trimming her caps and getting her ready to go to a party as to abuse she dont know what it is
she never was whipped more than once or twice in her whole life she has her strong coffee or her tea every day with white sugar in it
it abominable to be sure but augustine_st_clare will have high life below stairs and they every one of them live just as they please
i suppose it is partly our fault that they are selfish and act like spoiled child but i ve talked to augustine_st_clare till i am tired
miss_eva the beautiful miss_eva had stood listening to her mother with that expression of deep and mystic earnestness which was peculiar to her
the fact is our servant are over indulged and i too said augustine_st_clare taking up the morning paper she walked softly round to her mother chair and put her arm round her neck
well miss_eva what now said marie_st_clare mamma couldnt i take care of you one night just one i know i shouldnt make you nervous and i shouldnt sleep
i often lie awake night thinking nonsense child nonsense said marie_st_clare you are such a strange child but may i mamma
i think she said timidly that mammy isnt well she told me her head ached all the time lately that just one of mammy fidgets
mammy is just like all the rest of them makes such a fuss about every little headache or finger ache it ll never do to encourage it never
if you encourage servant in giving way to every little disagreeable feeling and complaining of every little ailment you ll have your hand full
i principled about this matter said she turning to miss_ophelia you ll find the necessity of it i never complain myself nobody knows what i endure
miss_ophelia round eye expressed an undisguised amazement at this peroration which struck augustine_st_clare as so supremely ludicrous that he burst into a loud laugh
augustine_st_clare always laughs when i make the least allusion to my ill health said marie_st_clare with the voice of a suffering martyr
i feel it a duty to bear it quietly and i do i only hope the day wont come when he ll remember it
and marie_st_clare put her handkerchief to her eye of course there was rather a foolish silence finally augustine_st_clare got up looked at his watch and said he had an engagement down street
now that just like augustine_st_clare said the latter withdrawing her handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to be affected by it was no longer in sight
miss_eva tripped away after him and miss_ophelia and marie_st_clare remained at the table alone he never realizes never can never will what i suffer and have for year
if i was one of the complaining sort or ever made any fuss about my ailments there would be some reason for it
but i ve kept thing to myself and borne and borne till augustine_st_clare has got in the way of thinking i can bear anything
man do get tired naturally of a complaining wife miss_ophelia did not exactly know what she was expected to answer to this
while she was thinking what to say marie_st_clare gradually wiped away her tear and smoothed her plumage in a general sort of way as a dove might be supposed to make toilet after a shower and began a housewifely chat with miss_ophelia concerning cupboards closets linen presses store room and other matter of which the latter was by common understanding to assume the direction giving her so many cautious directions and charges that a head less systematic and business like than miss_ophelia would have been utterly dizzied and confounded
and now said marie_st_clare i believe i ve told you everything so that when my next sick turn comes on you ll be able to go forward entirely without consulting me only about miss_eva she requires watching
she seems to be a good child very said miss_ophelia i never saw a better child miss_eva peculiar said her mother very
there are thing about her so singular she isnt like me now a particle and marie_st_clare sighed as if this was a truly melancholy consideration
miss_ophelia in her own heart said i hope she isnt but had prudence enough to keep it down miss_eva always was disposed to be with servant and i think that well enough with some child
now i always played with father little negroes it never did me any harm but miss_eva somehow always seems to put herself on an equality with every creature that comes near her
it a strange thing about the child i never have been able to break her of it augustine_st_clare i believe encourages her in it
the fact is augustine_st_clare indulges every creature under this roof but his own wife again miss_ophelia sat in blank silence
now there no way with servant said marie_st_clare but to put them down and keep them down it was always natural to me from a child
miss_eva is enough to spoil a whole house full what she will do when she comes to keep house herself i sure i dont know
miss_eva never does there no getting into the child head the first beginning of an idea what a servant place is
i hold to being kind to servant i always am but you must make em know their place you heard her offering to take care of me night to let mammy sleep
that just a specimen of the way the child would be doing all the time if she was left to herself
why said miss_ophelia bluntly i suppose you think your servant are human creature and ought to have some rest when they are tired
certainly of course i very particular in letting them have everything that comes convenient anything that doesnt put one at all out of the way you know
she the sleepiest concern that ever i saw sewing standing or sitting that creature will go to sleep and sleep anywhere and everywhere
mammy can make up her sleep some time or other there no difficulty about that no danger but mammy gets sleep enough
but this treating servant as if they were exotic flowers or china vases is really ridiculous said marie_st_clare as she plunged languidly into the depths of a voluminous and pillowy lounge and drew towards her an elegant cut glass vinaigrette
you see she continued in a faint and lady like voice like the last dying breath of an arabian jessamine or something equally ethereal you see cousin miss_ophelia i dont often speak of myself
it isnt my habitt isnt agreeable to me in fact i havent strength to do it but there are points where augustine_st_clare and i differ
augustine_st_clare never understood me never appreciated me i think it lies at the root of all my ill health augustine_st_clare means well i am bound to believe but man are constitutionally selfish and inconsiderate to woman
miss_ophelia who had not a small share of the genuine new england caution and a very particular horror of being drawn into family difficulties now began to foresee something of this kind impending so composing her face into a grim neutrality and drawing out of her pocket about a yard and a quarter of stocking which she kept as a specific against what dr watts asserts to be a personal habit of satan when people have idle hand she proceeded to knit most energetically shutting her lips together in a way that said as plain as word could you neednt try to make me speak
that at least is my impression i dont want anything to do with your affairs in fact she looked about as sympathizing as a stone lion
she had got somebody to talk to and she felt it her duty to talk and that was enough and reinforcing herself by smelling again at her vinaigrette she went on
you see i brought my own property and servant into the connection when i married augustine_st_clare and i am legally entitled to manage them my own way
augustine_st_clare had his fortune and his servant and i well enough content he should manage them his way but augustine_st_clare will be interfering
he really does act as if he set his servant before me and before himself too for he lets them make him all sort of trouble and never lifts a finger
but marie_st_clare didnt care for that he has wild extravagant notions about thing particularly about the treatment of servant now about some thing augustine_st_clare is really frightful he frightens me good natured as he looks in general
now he has set down his foot that come what will there shall not be a blow struck in this house except what he or i strike and he does it in a way that i really dare not cross him
well you may see what that leads to for augustine_st_clare wouldnt raise his hand if every one of them walked over him and i
you see how cruel it would be to require me to make the exertion now you know these servant are nothing but grown up child
i dont know anything about it and i thank the lord that i dont said miss_ophelia shortly well but you will have to know something and know it to your cost if you stay here
marie_st_clare seemed wonderfully supported always when she got upon this topic and she now opened her eye and seemed quite to forget her languor
you dont know what a provoking stupid careless unreasonable childish ungrateful set of wretches they are you dont know and you cant the daily hourly trials that beset a housekeeper from them everywhere and every way
but it no use to complain to augustine_st_clare he talks the strangest stuff he says we have made them what they are and ought to bear with them
he says their faults are all owing to us and that it would be cruel to make the fault and punish it too
he says we shouldnt do any better in their place just as if one could reason from them to us you know
dont you believe that the lord made them of one blood with us said miss_ophelia shortly no indeed not i
a pretty story truly they are a degraded race dont you think they ve got immortal soul said miss_ophelia with increasing indignation
but as to putting them on any sort of equality with us you know as if we could be compared why it impossible
now augustine_st_clare really has talked to me as if keeping mammy from her husband was like keeping me from mine
well said marie_st_clare yawning that of course nobody doubts that there no comparing in this way mammy couldnt have the feeling that i should
it a different thing altogether of course it is and yet augustine_st_clare pretends not to see it and just as if mammy could love her little dirty babies as i love miss_eva
yet augustine_st_clare once really and soberly tried to persuade me that it was my duty with my weak health and all i suffer to let mammy go back and take somebody else in her place
i dont often show my feeling i make it a principle to endure everything in silence it a wife hard lot and i bear it
that was a little too much even for me to bear but i did break out that time so that he has never alluded to the subject since
but i know by his looks and little thing that he says that he thinks so as much as ever and it so trying so provoking
miss_ophelia looked very much as if she was afraid she should say something but she rattled away with her needles in a way that had volumes of meaning in it if marie_st_clare could only have understood it
a household without any rule where servant have it all their own way do what they please and have what they please except so far as i with my feeble health have kept up government
i keep my cowhide about and sometimes i do lay it on but the exertion is always too much for me
so you just see she continued what you ve got to manage if augustine_st_clare would only have this thing done as others do
and how that why send them to the calaboose or some of the other place to be flogged that the only way
if i wasnt such a poor feeble piece i believe i should manage with twice the energy that augustine_st_clare does
and how does augustine_st_clare contrive to manage said miss_ophelia you say he never strikes a blow
well man have a more commanding way you know it is easier for them besides if you ever looked full in his eye it peculiar that
eye and if he speaks decidedly there a kind of flash i afraid of it myself and the servant know they must mind
i couldnt do as much by a regular storm and scolding as augustine_st_clare can by one turn of his eye if once he is in earnest
o there no trouble about augustine_st_clare that the reason he no more feeling for me but you ll find when you come to manage that there no getting along without severity they
are so bad so deceitful so lazy the old tune said augustine_st_clare sauntering in what an awful account these wicked creature will have to settle at last especially for being lazy
you see cousin said he as he stretched himself at full length on a lounge opposite to marie_st_clare it wholly inexcusable in them in the light of the example that marie_st_clare and i set them this laziness
come now augustine_st_clare you are too bad said marie_st_clare am i now why i thought i was talking good quite remarkably for me
i try to enforce your remarks marie_st_clare always you know you meant no such thing augustine_st_clare said marie_st_clare i must have been mistaken then
o come marie_st_clare the day is growing warm and i have just had a long quarrel with dolph which has fatigued me excessively so pray be agreeable now and let a fellow repose in the light of your smile
thank you my dear for setting me right you do really try to be provoking said marie_st_clare what the matter about dolph said marie_st_clare
that fellow impudence has been growing to a point that is perfectly intolerable to me i only wish i had the undisputed management of him a while
i bring him down what you say my dear is marked with your usual acuteness and good sense said augustine_st_clare
as to dolph the case is this that he has so long been engaged in imitating my graces and perfections that he has at last really mistaken himself for his master and i have been obliged to give him a little insight into his mistake
why i was obliged to let him understand explicitly that i preferred to keep some of my clothes for my own personal wearing also i put his magnificence upon an allowance of cologne water and actually was so cruel as to restrict him to one dozen of my cambric handkerchiefs
how said marie_st_clare dolph was particularly huffy about it and i had to talk to him like a father to bring him round
augustine_st_clare when will you learn how to treat your servant it abominable the way you indulge them said marie_st_clare
why after all what the harm of the poor dog wanting to be like his master and if i havent brought him up any better than to find his chief good in cologne and cambric handkerchiefs why shouldnt i give them to him
and why havent you brought him up better said miss_ophelia with blunt determination too much trouble laziness cousin laziness which ruins more soul than you can shake a stick at
i inclined to think that laziness is what your old dr botherem up in vermont used to call the essence of moral evil
if it werent for laziness i should have been a perfect angel myself it an awful consideration certainly i think you slaveholders have an awful responsibility upon you said miss_ophelia
you ought to educate your slave and treat them like reasonable creature like immortal creature that you ve got to stand before the bar of god with
that my mind said the good lady breaking suddenly out with a tide of zeal that had been gaining strength in her mind all the morning
i wouldnt have it for a thousand world come come said augustine_st_clare getting up quickly what do you know about us
and he sat down to the piano and rattled a lively piece of music augustine_st_clare had a decided genius for music
his touch was brilliant and firm and his fingers flew over the keys with a rapid and mrs_bird like motion airy and yet decided
after pushing the music aside he rose up and said gayly well now cousin you ve given us a good talk and done your duty on the whole i think the better of you for it
i make no manner of doubt that you threw a very diamond of truth at me though you see it hit me so directly in the face that it wasnt exactly appreciated at first
he played piece after piece like a man who is trying to play himself into a good humor for my part i dont see any use in such sort of talk said marie_st_clare
i sure if anybody does more for servant than we do i like to know who and it dont do em a bit
as to talking to them or anything like that i sure i have talked till i was tired and hoarse telling them their duty and all that and i sure they can go to church when they like though they dont understand a word of the sermon more than so many pigs so it isnt of any great use for them to go as i see but they do go and so they have every chance but as i said before they are a degraded race and always will be and there isnt any help for them
good not a particle they get worse and worse you cant make anything of them if you try you see cousin miss_ophelia i ve tried and you havent i was born and bred among them and i know
miss_ophelia thought she had said enough and therefore sat silent augustine_st_clare whistled a tune augustine_st_clare i wish you wouldnt whistle said marie_st_clare it makes my head worse
i wont said augustine_st_clare is there anything else you wouldnt wish me to do i wish you would have some kind of sympathy for my trials you never have any feeling for me
my dear accusing angel said augustine_st_clare it provoking to be talked to in that way then how will you be talked to
i ll talk to order any way you ll mention only to give satisfaction a gay laugh from the court rang through the silken curtains of the verandah
augustine_st_clare stepped out and lifting up the curtain laughed too what is it said miss_ophelia coming to the railing
there sat tom_loker on a little mossy seat in the court every one of his button holes stuck full of cape jessamines and miss_eva gayly laughing was hanging a wreath of roses round his neck and then she sat down on his knee like a chip sparrow still laughing
tom_loker had a sober benevolent smile and seemed in his quiet way to be enjoying the fun quite as much as his little mistress
tom_loker you look so funny he lifted his eye when he saw his master with a half deprecating apologetic air
how can you let her said miss_ophelia why not said augustine_st_clare why i dont know it seems so dreadful
you would think no harm in a child caressing a large dog even if he was black but a creature that can think and reason and feel and is immortal you shudder at confess it cousin
not that there is a particle of virtue in our not having it but custom with us does what christianity ought to do obliterates the feeling of personal prejudice
i know the feeling among some of you northerners well enough i have often noticed in my travels north how much stronger this was with you than with us
you loathe them as you would a snake or a toad yet you are indignant at their wrongs you would not have them abused but you dont want to have anything to do with them yourselves
you would send them to africa out of your sight and smell and then send a missionary or two to do up all the self denial of elevating them compendiously
what would the poor and lowly do without child said augustine_st_clare leaning on the railing and watching miss_eva as she tripped off leading tom_loker with her
isnt that it well cousin said miss_ophelia thoughtfully there may be some truth in this your little child is your only true democrat
tom_loker now is a hero to miss_eva his stories are wonders in her eye his songs and methodist hymns are better than an opera and the traps and little bits of trash in his pocket a mine of jewels and he the most wonderful tom_loker that ever wore a black skin
this is one of the roses of eden that the lord has dropped down expressly for the poor and lowly who get few enough of any other kind
it strange cousin said miss_ophelia one might almost think you were a professor to hear you talk
not at all not a professor as your town folks have it and what is worse i afraid not a practiser either
a professor said augustine_st_clare yes a professor of religion what makes you talk so then nothing is easier than talking said augustine_st_clare
i believe shakespeare makes somebody say i could sooner show twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow my own showing
nothing like division of labor my forte lies in talking and yours cousin lies in doing the merchant of venice act scene lines
in tom_loker external situation at this time there was as the world says nothing to complain of little miss_eva fancy for him the instinctive gratitude and loveliness of a noble nature had led her to petition her father that he might be her especial attendant whenever she needed the escort of a servant in her walks or rides and tom_loker had general orders to let everything else go and attend to miss_eva whenever she wanted him orders which our readers may fancy were far from disagreeable to him
his stable services were merely a sinecure and consisted simply in a daily care and inspection and directing an under servant in his duties for marie_st_clare augustine_st_clare declared that she could not have any smell of the horse about him when he came near her and that he must positively not be put to any service that would make him unpleasant to her as her nervous system was entirely inadequate to any trial of that nature one snuff of anything disagreeable being according to her account quite sufficient to close the scene and put an end to all her earthly trials at once
tom_loker therefore in his well brushed broadcloth suit smooth beaver glossy boots faultless wristbands and collar with his grave good natured black face looked respectable enough to be a bishop of carthage as man of his color were in other ages
then too he was in a beautiful place a consideration to which his sensitive race was never indifferent and he did enjoy with a quiet joy the birds the flowers the fountains the perfume and light and beauty of the court the silken hangings and pictures and lustres and statuettes and gilding that made the parlors within a kind of aladdin palace to him
he was kept well dressed for augustine_st_clare was fastidiously particular on this point if ever africa shall show an elevated and cultivated race and come it must
some time her turn to figure in the great drama of human improvement life will awake there with a gorgeousness and splendor of which our cold western tribes faintly have conceived
in that far off mystic land of gold and gems and spices and waving palms and wondrous flowers and miraculous fertility will awake new form of art new styles of splendor and the negro race no longer despised and trodden down will perhaps show forth some of the latest and most magnificent revelations of human life
certainly they will in their gentleness their lowly docility of heart their aptitude to repose on a superior mind and rest on a higher power their childlike simplicity of affection and facility of forgiveness
in all these they will exhibit the highest form of the peculiarly christian life and perhaps as god chasteneth whom he loveth he hath chosen poor africa in the furnace of affliction to make her the highest and noblest in that kingdom which he will set up when every other kingdom has been tried and failed for the first shall be last and the last first
was this what marie_st_clare augustine_st_clare was thinking of as she stood gorgeously dressed on the verandah on sunday morning clasping a diamond bracelet on her slender wrist
or if it wasnt that it was something else for marie_st_clare patronized good thing and she was going now in full force diamonds silk and lace and jewels and all to a fashionable church to be very religious
most likely it was marie_st_clare always made a point to be very pious on sundays there she stood so slender so elegant so airy and undulating in all her motions
her lace scarf enveloping her like a mist she looked a graceful creature and she felt very good and very elegant indeed
it was not that she had not as handsome a silk dress and shawl and as fine a pocket handkerchief but stiffness and squareness and bolt uprightness enveloped her with as indefinite yet appreciable a presence as did grace her elegant neighbor not the grace of god however that is quite another thing
miss_ophelia stood at her side a perfect contrast where miss_eva said marie_st_clare the child stopped on the stairs to say something to mammy
and what was miss_eva saying to mammy on the stairs listen reader and you will hear though marie_st_clare does not
dear mammy i know your head is aching dreadfully lord bless you miss_eva my head allers aches lately you dont need to worry
well i glad you re going out and here and the little girl threw her arm around her mammy you shall take my vinaigrette
what your beautiful gold thing thar with them diamonds lor misst wouldnt be proper no way why not
you need it and i dont mamma always uses it for headache and it ll make you feel better no you shall take it to please me now
do hear the darlin talk said mammy as miss_eva thrust it into her bosom and kissing her ran down stairs to her mother
what were you stopping for i was just stopping to give mammy my vinaigrette to take to church with her
miss_eva said marie_st_clare stamping impatiently your gold vinaigrette to mammy when will you learn what proper go right and take it back this moment
miss_eva looked downcast and aggrieved and turned slowly i say marie_st_clare let the child alone she shall do as she pleases said augustine_st_clare
augustine_st_clare how will she ever get along in the world said marie_st_clare the lord knows said augustine_st_clare but she ll get along in heaven better than you or i
papa dont said miss_eva softly touching his elbow it troubles mother well cousin are you ready to go to meeting said miss_ophelia turning square about on augustine_st_clare
i not going thank you i do wish augustine_st_clare ever would go to church said marie_st_clare but he hasnt a particle of religion about him
you lady go to church to learn how to get along in the world i suppose and your piety sheds respectability on us
if i did go at all i would go where mammy goes there something to keep a fellow awake there at least
it really isnt respectable i know it said augustine_st_clare what those shouting methodists horrible said marie_st_clare anything but the dead sea of your respectable churches marie_st_clare
positively it too much to ask of a man miss_eva do you like to go come stay at home and play with me
thank you papa but i rather go to church isnt it dreadful tiresome said augustine_st_clare i think it is tiresome some said miss_eva and i am sleepy too but i try to keep awake
why you know papa she said in a whisper cousin told me that god wants to have us and he gives us everything you know and it isnt much to do it if he wants us to
what do you go for then it isnt so very tiresome after all you sweet little obliging soul said augustine_st_clare kissing her go along that a good girl and pray for me
augustine_st_clare stood on the steps and kissed his hand to her as the carriage drove away large tear were in his eye
certainly i always do said the child as she sprang after her mother into the carriage evangeline rightly named he said hath not god made thee an evangel to me
so he felt a moment and then he smoked a cigar and read the picayune and forgot his little gospel was he much unlike other folks
you see evangeline said her mother it always right and proper to be kind to servant but it isnt proper to treat them just as we would our relations or people in our own class of life
i should feel just like it mamma said miss_eva because then it would be handier to take care of her and because you know my bed is better than hers
now if mammy was sick you wouldnt want to put her in your own bed marie_st_clare was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception evinced in this reply
miss_eva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment but child luckily do not keep to one impression long and in a few moment she was merrily laughing at various thing which she saw from the coach window as it rattled along
what can i do to make this child understand me she said nothing said miss_ophelia significantly
well lady said augustine_st_clare as they were comfortably seated at the dinner table and what was the bill of fare at church today
dr preached a splendid sermon said marie_st_clare it was just such a sermon as you ought to hear it expressed all my views exactly
it must have been very improving said augustine_st_clare the subject must have been an extensive one well i mean all my views about society and such thing said marie_st_clare
the text was he hath made everything beautiful in its season and he showed how all the orders and distinctions in society came from god and that it was so appropriate you know and beautiful that some should be high and some low and that some were born to rule and some to serve and all that you know and he applied it so well to all this ridiculous fuss that is made about slavery and he proved distinctly that the bible was on our side and supported all our institutions so convincingly
i can learn what does me as much good as that from the picayune any time and smoke a cigar besides which i cant do you know in a church
i only wish you heard him i didnt need it said augustine_st_clare why said miss_ophelia dont you believe in these views
if i was to say anything on this slavery matter i would say out fair and square we re in for it we ve got em and mean to keep em it for our convenience and our interest for that the long and short of it that just the whole of what all this sanctified stuff amounts to after all and i think that it will be intelligible to everybody everywhere
who i you know i such a graceless dog that these religious aspects of such subjects dont edify me much i do think augustine_st_clare you are so irreverent said marie_st_clare
this religious talk on such matter why dont they carry it a little further and show the beauty in its season of a fellow taking a glass too much and sitting a little too late over his cards and various providential arrangements of that sort which are pretty frequent among us
i think it shocking to hear you talk shocking it the truth young man we like to hear that those are right and godly too
well said miss_ophelia do you think slavery right or wrong i not going to have any of your horrid new england directness cousin said augustine_st_clare gayly
if i answer that question i know you ll be at me with half a dozen others each one harder than the last and i not a going to define my position
i am one of the sort that life by throwing stones at other people glass house but i never mean to put up one for them to stone
that just the way he always talking said marie_st_clare you cant get any satisfaction out of him i believe it just because he dont like religion that he always running out in this way he been doing
religion said augustine_st_clare in a tone that made both lady look at him religion is what you hear at church religion
is that which can bend and turn and descend and ascend to fit every crooked phase of selfish worldly society religion
is that religion which is less scrupulous less generous less just less considerate for man than even my own ungodly worldly blinded nature
no when i look for a religion i must look for something above me and not something beneath then you dont believe that the bible justifies slavery said miss_ophelia
the bible was my mother book said augustine_st_clare by it she lived and died and i would be very sorry to think it did
i as soon desire to have it proved that my mother could drink brandy chew tobacco and swear by way of satisfying me that i did right in doing the same
it wouldnt make me at all more satisfied with these thing in myself and it would take from me the comfort of respecting her and it really is a comfort in this world to have anything one can respect
in short you see said he suddenly resuming his gay tone all i want is that different thing be kept in different boxes
the whole frame work of society both in europe and america is made up of various thing which will not stand the scrutiny of any very ideal standard of morality
it pretty generally understood that man dont aspire after the absolute right but only to do about as well as the rest of the world
now when any one speaks up like a man and says slavery is necessary to us we cant get along without it we should be beggared if we give it up and of course we mean to hold on to it this
is strong clear well defined language it has the respectability of truth to it and if we may judge by their practice the majority of the world will bear us out in it
but when he begins to put on a long face and snuffle and quote scripture i incline to think he isnt much better than he should be
well said augustine_st_clare suppose that something should bring down the price of cotton once and forever and make the whole slave property a drug in the market dont you think we should soon have another version of the scripture doctrine
what a flood of light would pour into the church all at once and how immediately it would be discovered that everything in the bible and reason went the other way
well at any rate said marie_st_clare as she reclined herself on a lounge i thankful i born where slavery exists and i believe it right indeed
you are very uncharitable said marie_st_clare i feel it must be and at any rate i sure i couldnt get along without it
i say what do you think pussy said her father to miss_eva who came in at this moment with a flower in her hand
why which do you like the best to live as they do at your uncle up in vermont or to have a house full of servant as we do
what about papa of course our way is the pleasantest said miss_eva why so said augustine_st_clare stroking her head
why it makes so many more round you to love you know said miss_eva looking up earnestly now that just like miss_eva said marie_st_clare just one of her odd speeches
is it an odd speech papa said miss_eva whisperingly as she got upon his knee rather as this world goes pussy said augustine_st_clare
but where has my little miss_eva been all dinner time i ve been up in tom_loker room hearing him sing and aunt dinah gave me my dinner
hearing tom_loker sing hey yes he sings such beautiful thing about the new jerusalem and bright angels and the land of canaan
i dare say it better than the opera isnt it yes and he going to teach them to me singing lessons hey you are coming on
yes he sings for me and i read to him in my bible and he explains what it means you know
on my word said marie_st_clare laughing that is the latest joke of the season tom_loker isnt a bad hand now at explaining scripture i ll dare swear said augustine_st_clare
i wanted the horse out early this morning and i stole up to tom_loker cubiculum there over the stables and there i heard him holding a meeting by himself and in fact i havent heard anything quite so savory as tom_loker prayer this some time
tom_loker has a natural genius for religion he put in for me with a zeal that was quite apostolic perhaps he guessed you were listening
i ve heard of that trick before if he did he wasnt very polite for he gave the lord his opinion of me pretty freely
tom_loker seemed to think there was decidedly room for improvement in me and seemed very earnest that i should be converted
i hope you ll lay it to heart said miss_ophelia i suppose you are much of the same opinion said augustine_st_clare
well we shall see shant we miss_eva chapter xvii the freeman defence there was a gentle bustle at the quaker house as the afternoon drew to a close
rachel_halliday moved quietly to and fro collecting from her household stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest compass for the wanderers who were to go forth that night
the afternoon shadows stretched eastward and the round red sun stood thoughtfully on the horizon and his beams shone yellow and calm into the little bed room where george_harris and his wife were sitting
he was sitting with his child on his knee and his wife hand in his both looked thoughtful and serious and traces of tear were on their cheeks
yes eliza_harris said george_harris i know all you say is true you are a good child a great deal better than i am and i will try to do as you say
i ll try to act worthy of a free man i ll try to feel like a christian god almighty knows that i ve meant to do
everything has been against me and now i ll forget all the past and put away every hard and bitter feeling and read my bible and learn to be a good man
i can do dress making very well and i understand fine washing and ironing and between us we can find something to live on
well tried hard to do well when and when we get to canada said eliza_harris i can help you yes eliza_harris so long as we have each other and our boy
eliza_harris if these people only knew what a blessing it is for a man to feel that his wife and child belong to him
i ve often wondered to see man that could call their wife and child their own fretting and worrying about anything else
o why i feel rich and strong though we have nothing but our bare hand i feel as if i could scarcely ask god for any more
yes though i ve worked hard every day till i am twenty five year old and have not a cent of money nor a roof to cover me nor a spot of land to call my own yet if they will only let me alone now i will be satisfied thankful i will work and send back the money for you and my boy
as to my old master he has been paid five time over for all he ever spent for me i dont owe him anything
but yet we are not quite out of danger said eliza_harris we are not yet in canada true said george_harris but it seems as if i smelt the free air and it makes me strong
at this moment voice were heard in the outer apartment in earnest conversation and very soon a rap was heard on the door
eliza_harris started and opened it simeon_halliday was there and with him a quaker brother whom he introduced as phineas_fletcher
he had not the placid quiet unworldly air of simeon_halliday on the contrary a particularly wide awake and au fait appearance like a man who rather prides himself on knowing what he is about and keeping a bright lookout ahead peculiarities which sorted rather oddly with his broad brim and formal phraseology
our friend phineas_fletcher hath discovered something of importance to the interests of thee and thy party george_harris said simeon_halliday it were well for thee to hear it
that i have said phineas_fletcher and it shows the use of a man always sleeping with one ear open in certain place as i ve always said
phineas_fletcher was tall and lathy red haired with an expression of great acuteness and shrewdness in his face last night i stopped at a little lone tavern back on the road
well i was tired with hard driving and after my supper i stretched myself down on a pile of bags in the corner and pulled a buffalo over me to wait till my bed was ready and what does i do but get fast asleep
thee remembers the place simeon_halliday where we sold some apples last year to that fat woman with the great ear rings
no i slept ear and all for an hour or two for i was pretty well tired but when i came to myself a little i found that there were some man in the room sitting round a table drinking and talking and i thought before i made much muster i just see what they were up to especially as i heard them say something about the quakers
with one ear open phineas_fletcher said simeon_halliday quietly so says one they are up in the quaker settlement no doubt says he
then i listened with both ear and i found that they were talking about this very party so i lay and heard them lay off all their plans
this young man they said was to be sent back to kentucky to his master who was going to make an example of him to keep all nigger from running away and his wife two of them were going to run down to new orleans to sell on their own account and they calculated to get sixteen or eighteen hundred dollar for her and the child they said was going to a trader who had bought him and then there was the boy jim_crow and his mother
they said that there were two constables in a town a little piece ahead who would go in with em to get em taken up and the young woman was to be taken before a judge and one of the fellow who is small and smooth spoken was to swear to her for his property and get her delivered over to him to take south
they ve got a right notion of the track we are going tonight and they ll be down after us six or eight strong
they were to go back to their master in kentucky so now what to be done the group that stood in various attitudes after this communication were worthy of a painter
rachel_halliday who had taken her hand out of a batch of biscuit to hear the news stood with them upraised and floury and with a face of the deepest concern
george_harris stood with clenched hand and glowing eye and looking as any other man might look whose wife was to be sold at auction and son sent to a trader all under the shelter of a christian nation law
simeon_halliday looked profoundly thoughtful eliza_harris had thrown her arm around her husband and was looking up to him what shall we do george_harris said eliza_harris faintly
i know what i shall do said george_harris as he stepped into the little room and began examining pistols
ay ay said phineas_fletcher nodding his head to simeon_halliday thou seest simeon_halliday how it will work i see said simeon_halliday sighing i pray it come not to that
i dont want to involve any one with or for me said george_harris if you will lend me your vehicle and direct me i will drive alone to the next stand
jim_crow is a giant in strength and brave as death and despair and so am i ah well friend said phineas_fletcher but thee ll need a driver for all that
thee quite welcome to do all the fighting thee knows but i know a thing or two about the road that thee doesnt
involve said phineas_fletcher with a curious and keen expression of face when thee does involve me please to let me know
but i dont want to involve you said george_harris phineas_fletcher is a wise and skilful man said simeon_halliday
thee does well george_harris to abide by his judgment and he added laying his hand kindly on george_harris shoulder and pointing to the pistols be not over hasty with these young blood is hot
all i ask of this country is to be let alone and i will go out peaceably but he paused and his brow darkened and his face worked i ve had a sister sold in that new orleans market
i know what they are sold for and am i going to stand by and see them take my wife and sell her when god has given me a pair of strong arm to defend her
i will attack no man said george_harris no god help me i ll fight to the last breath before they shall take my wife and son
can you blame me mortal man cannot blame thee george_harris flesh and blood could not do otherwise said simeon_halliday woe unto the world because of offences but woe unto them through whom the offence cometh
would not even you sir do the same in my place i pray that i be not tried said simeon_halliday the flesh is weak
i think my flesh would be pretty tolerable strong in such a case said phineas_fletcher stretching out a pair of arm like the sails of a windmill
i ant sure friend george_harris that i shouldnt hold a fellow for thee if thee had any accounts to settle with him
if man should ever resist evil said simeon_halliday then george_harris should feel free to do it now but the leaders of our people taught a more excellent way for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of god but it goes sorely against the corrupt will of man and none can receive it save they to whom it is given
let us pray the lord that we be not tempted and so i do said phineas_fletcher but if we are tempted too much why let them look out that all
it quite plain thee wasnt born a friend said simeon_halliday smiling the old nature hath its way in thee pretty strong as yet
to tell the truth phineas_fletcher had been a hearty two fisted backwoodsman a vigorous hunter and a dead shot at a buck but having wooed a pretty quakeress had been moved by the power of her charms to join the society in his neighborhood and though he was an honest sober and efficient member and nothing particular could be alleged against him yet the more spiritual among them could not but discern an exceeding lack of savor in his developments
friend phineas_fletcher will ever have way of his own said rachel_halliday smiling but we all think that his heart is in the right place after all
i got up at four clock and came on with all speed full two or three hour ahead of them if they start at the time they planned
it isnt safe to start till dark at any rate for there are some evil persons in the villages ahead that might be disposed to meddle with us if they saw our wagon and that would delay us more than the waiting but in two hour i think we may venture
i will go over to michael cross and engage him to come behind on his swift nag and keep a bright lookout on the road and warn us if any company of man come on
michael keeps a horse that can soon get ahead of most other horse and he could shoot ahead and let us know if there were any danger
i am going out now to warn jim_crow and the old woman to be in readiness and to see about the horse
we have a pretty fair start and stand a good chance to get to the stand before they can come up with us
so have good courage friend george_harris this isnt the first ugly scrape that i ve been in with thy people said phineas_fletcher as he closed the door
well said george_harris isnt it best that we hasten our flight phineas_fletcher is pretty shrewd said simeon_halliday
he will do the best that can be done for thee george_harris all i am sorry for said george_harris is the risk to you
thee ll much oblige us friend george_harris to say no more about that what we do we are conscience bound to do we can do no other way
and now mother said he turning to rachel_halliday hurry thy preparations for these friend for we must not send them away fasting
and while rachel_halliday and her child were busy making corn cake and cooking ham and chicken and hurrying on the et ceteras of the evening meal george_harris and his wife sat in their little room with their arm folded about each other in such talk as husband and wife have when they know that a few hour may part them forever
eliza_harris said george_harris people that have friend and house and lands and money and all those thing cant love as we do who have nothing but each other
till i knew you eliza_harris no creature had loved me but my poor heart broken mother and sister i saw poor emily that morning the trader carried her off
she came to the corner where i was lying asleep and said poor george_harris your last friend is going what will become of you poor boy
and i got up and threw my arm round her and cried and sobbed and she cried too and those were the last kind word i got for ten long year and my heart all withered up and felt as dry as ashes till i met you
and your loving me why it was almost like raising one from the dead i ve been a new man ever since and now eliza_harris i ll give my last drop of blood but they shall not take you from me
whoever gets you must walk over my dead body lord have mercy said eliza_harris sobbing if he will only let us get out of this country together that is all we ask
is god on their side said george_harris speaking less to his wife than pouring out his own bitter thoughts does he see all they do
why does he let such thing happen and they tell us that the bible is on their side certainly all the power is
they are rich and healthy and happy they are members of churches expecting to go to heaven and they get along so easy in the world and have it all their own way and poor honest faithful christians christians as good or better than they are lying in the very dust under their foot
they buy em and sell em and make trade of their heart blood and groans and tear and god lets them friend george_harris said simeon_halliday from the kitchen listen to this psalm it may do thee good
george_harris drew his seat near the door and eliza_harris wiping her tear came forward also to listen while simeon_halliday read as follows
but as for me my foot were almost gone my steps had well nigh slipped for i was envious of the foolish when i saw the prosperity of the wicked
they are not in trouble like other man neither are they plagued like other man therefore pride compasseth them as a chain violence covereth them as a garment
their eye stand out with fatness they have more than heart could wish they are corrupt and speak wickedly concerning oppression they speak loftily
therefore his people return and the water of a full cup are wrung out to them and they say how doth god know
and is there knowledge in the most high is not that the way thee feels george_harris it is so indeed said george_harris as well as i could have written it myself
then hear said simeon_halliday when i thought to know this it was too painful for me until i went unto the sanctuary of god
then understood i their end surely thou didst set them in slippery place thou castedst them down to destruction as a dream when one awaketh so oh lord when thou awakest thou shalt despise their image
nevertheless i am continually with thee thou hast holden me by my right hand thou shalt guide me by thy counsel and afterwards receive me to glory
it is good for me to draw near unto god i have put my trust in the lord god
the word of holy trust breathed by the friendly old man stole like sacred music over the harassed and chafed spirit of george_harris and after he ceased he sat with a gentle and subdued expression on his fine features
ps the end of the wicked contrasted with that of the righteous if this world were all george_harris said simeon_halliday thee might indeed ask where is the lord
but it is often those who have least of all in this life whom he chooseth for the kingdom put thy trust in him and no matter what befalls thee here he will make all right hereafter
if these word had been spoken by some easy self indulgent exhorter from whose mouth they might have come merely as pious and rhetorical flourish proper to be used to people in distress perhaps they might not have had much effect but coming from one who daily and calmly risked fine and imprisonment for the cause of god and man they had a weight that could not but be felt and both the poor desolate fugitives found calmness and strength breathing into them from it
and now rachel_halliday took eliza_harris hand kindly and led the way to the supper table as they were sitting down a light tap sounded at the door and ruth entered
i just ran in she said with these little stockings for the boy three pair nice warm woollen one it will be so cold thee knows in canada
she added tripping round to eliza_harris side of the table and shaking her warmly by the hand and slipping a seed cake into harry hand
does thee keep up good courage eliza_harris i brought a little parcel of these for him she said tugging at her pocket to get out the package
child thee knows will always be eating thank you you are too kind said eliza_harris come ruth sit down to supper said rachel_halliday
i left john_bunyan with the baby and some biscuits in the oven and i cant stay a moment else john_bunyan will burn up all the biscuits and give the baby all the sugar in the bowl
so good by eliza_harris good by george_harris the lord grant thee a safe journey and with a few tripping steps ruth was out of the apartment
a little while after supper a large covered wagon drew up before the door the night was clear starlight and phineas_fletcher jumped briskly down from his seat to arrange his passengers
i couldnt any way that the way he does said the little quakeress laughing george_harris walked out of the door with his child on one arm and his wife on the other
you get out a moment said phineas_fletcher to those inside and let me fix the back of the wagon there for the woman folks and the boy
his step was firm his face settled and resolute rachel_halliday and simeon_halliday came out after them here are the two buffaloes said rachel_halliday
jim_crow came out first and carefully assisted out his old mother who clung to his arm and looked anxiously about as if she expected the pursuer every moment
make the seats as comfortable as may be it hard riding all night jim_crow are your pistols all in order said george_harris in a low firm voice
yes indeed said jim_crow and you ve no doubt what you shall do if they come i rather think i havent said jim_crow throwing open his broad chest and taking a deep breath
during this brief colloquy eliza_harris had been taking her leave of her kind friend rachel_halliday and was handed into the carriage by simeon_halliday and creeping into the back part with her boy sat down among the buffalo skins
the old woman was next handed in and seated and george_harris and jim_crow placed on a rough board seat front of them and phineas_fletcher mounted in front
do you think i ll let them get mother again farewell my friend said simeon_halliday from without god bless you answered all from within
and the wagon drove off rattling and jolting over the frozen road there was no opportunity for conversation on account of the roughness of the way and the noise of the wheels
the vehicle therefore rumbled on through long dark stretches of woodland over wide dreary plains up hills and down valleys and on on on they jogged hour after hour
the poor frightened old woman at last forgot her fears and even eliza_harris as the night waned found all her anxieties insufficient to keep her eye from closing
phineas_fletcher seemed on the whole the briskest of the company and beguiled his long drive with whistling certain very unquaker like songs as he went on
but about three clock george_harris ear caught the hasty and decided click of a horse hoof coming behind them at some distance and jogged phineas_fletcher by the elbow
that must be michael he said i think i know the sound of his gallop and he rose up and stretched his head anxiously back over the road
the child soon fell asleep and lay heavily in his mother lap phineas_fletcher pulled up his horse and listened a man riding in hot haste was now dimly descried at the top of a distant hill
there he is i do believe said phineas_fletcher george_harris and jim_crow both sprang out of the wagon before they knew what they were doing
now he went down into a valley where they could not see him but they heard the sharp hasty tramp rising nearer and nearer at last they saw him emerge on the top of an eminence within hail
all stood intensely silent with their face turned towards the expected messenger on he came yes that michael said phineas_fletcher and raising his voice halloa there michael
phineas_fletcher is that thee yes what news they coming right on behind eight or ten of them hot with brandy swearing and foaming like so many wolves
and just as he spoke a breeze brought the faint sound of galloping horsemen towards them in with you quick boy in said phineas_fletcher
and with the word both jumped in and phineas_fletcher lashed the horse to a run the horseman keeping close beside them
the wagon rattled jumped almost flew over the frozen ground but plainer and still plainer came the noise of pursuing horsemen behind
the woman heard it and looking anxiously out saw far in the rear on the brow of a distant hill a party of man looming up against the red streaked sky of early dawn
if you must fight wait till i get you a piece ahead another hill and their pursuers had evidently caught sight of their wagon
whose white cloth covered top made it conspicuous at some distance and a loud yell of brutal triumph came forward on the wind
eliza_harris sickened and strained her child closer to her bosom the old woman prayed and groaned and george_harris and jim_crow clenched their pistols with the grasp of despair
the pursuers gained on them fast the carriage made a sudden turn and brought them near a ledge of a steep overhanging rock that rose in an isolated ridge or clump in a large lot which was all around it quite clear and smooth
this isolated pile or range of rocks rose up black and heavy against the brightening sky and seemed to promise shelter and concealment
it was a place well known to phineas_fletcher who had been familiar with the spot in his hunting day and it was to gain this point he had been racing his horse
now for it said he suddenly checking his horse and springing from his seat to the ground out with you in a twinkling every one and up into these rocks with me
michael thee tie thy horse to the wagon and drive ahead to amariah and get him and his boy to come back and talk to these fellow
there said phineas_fletcher catching up harry you each of you see to the woman and run now if you ever did run
quicker than we can say it the whole party were over the fence making with all speed for the rocks while michael throwing himself from his horse and fastening the bridle to the wagon began driving it rapidly away
come ahead said phineas_fletcher as they reached the rocks and saw in the mingled starlight and dawn the traces of a rude but plainly marked foot path leading up among them this is one of our old hunting dens
in a twinkling they were all out of the carriage they needed no exhortation come up phineas_fletcher went before springing up the rocks like a goat with the boy in his arm
the party of horsemen came up to the fence and with mingled shouts and oaths were dismounting to prepare to follow them
a few moment scrambling brought them to the top of the ledge the path then passed between a narrow defile where only one could walk at a time till suddenly they came to a rift or chasm more than a yard in breadth and beyond which lay a pile of rocks separate from the rest of the ledge standing full thirty foot high with its side steep and perpendicular as those of a castle
phineas_fletcher easily leaped the chasm and sat down the boy on a smooth flat platform of crisp white moss that covered the top of the rock
jim_crow came second bearing his trembling old mother over his shoulder and george_harris and eliza_harris brought up the rear over with you he called spring now once for your life said he as one after another sprang across
several fragments of loose stone formed a kind of breast work which sheltered their position from the observation of those below
well here we all are said phineas_fletcher peeping over the stone breast work to watch the assailants who were coming tumultuously up under the rocks
whoever comes here has to walk single file between those two rocks in fair range of your pistols boy ye see
let em get us if they can i do see said george_harris and now as this matter is ours let us take all the risk and do all the fighting
thee quite welcome to do the fighting george_harris said phineas_fletcher chewing some checkerberry leaves as he spoke but i may have the fun of looking on i suppose
but see these fellow are kinder debating down there and looking up like hens when they are going to fly up on to the roost
hadnt thee better give em a word of advice before they come up just to tell em handsomely they ll be shot if they do
the party beneath now more apparent in the light of the dawn consisted of our old acquaintances tom_loker and marks with two constables and a posse consisting of such rowdies at the last tavern as could be engaged by a little brandy to go and help the fun of trapping a set of nigger
well tom_loker yer coons are farly treed said one yes i see em go up right here said tom_loker
and here a path i for going right up they cant jump down in a hurry and it wont take long to ferret em out
but tom_loker they might fire at us from behind the rocks said marks that would be ugly you know
ugh said tom_loker with a sneer always for saving your skin marks no danger nigger are too plaguy scared
i dont know why i shouldnt save my skin said marks it the best i ve got and nigger do fight like the devil sometimes
at this moment george_harris appeared on the top of a rock above them and speaking in a calm clear voice said gentleman who are you down there and what do you want
we want a party of runaway nigger said tom_loker one george_harris and eliza_harris george_harris and their son and jim_crow selden and an old woman
we ve got the officers here and a warrant to take em and we re going to have em too ye hear ant you george_harris
that belongs to mr george_harris of mr_shelby county kentucky i am george_harris a mr george_harris of kentucky did call me his property
but now i a free man standing on god free soil and my wife and my child i claim as mine
you can come up if you like but the first one of you that comes within the range of our bullets is a dead man and the next and the next and so on till the last
jim_crow and his mother are here we have arm to defend ourselves and we mean to do it come come
said a short puffy man stepping forward and blowing his nose as he did so young man this ant no kind of talk at all for you
we ve got the law on our side and the power and so forth so you better give up peaceably you see for you ll certainly have to give up at last
you see we re officers of justice i know very well that you ve got the law on your side and the power said george_harris bitterly
you mean to take my wife to sell in new orleans and put my boy like a calf in a trader pen and send jim_crow old mother to the brute that whipped and abused her before because he couldnt abuse her son
you want to send jim_crow and me back to be whipped and tortured and ground down under the heels of them that you call master and your law will bear you out in it more shame for you and them
we dont own your law we dont own your country we stand here as free under god sky as you are and by the great god that made us we ll fight for our liberty till we die
george_harris stood out in fair sight on the top of the rock as he made his declaration of independence the glow of dawn gave a flush to his swarthy cheek and bitter indignation and despair gave fire to his dark eye and as if appealing from man to the justice of god he raised his hand to heaven as he spoke
if it had been only a hungarian youth now bravely defending in some mountain fastness the retreat of fugitives escaping from austria into america this would have been sublime heroism but as it was a youth of african descent defending the retreat of fugitives through america into canada of course we are too well instructed and patriotic to see any heroism in it and if any of our readers do they must do it on their own private responsibility
when despairing hungarian fugitives make their way against all the search warrants and authorities of their lawful government to america press and political cabinet ring with applause and welcome
be it as it may it is certain that the attitude eye voice manner of the speaker for a moment struck the party below to silence
but you havent got us when despairing african fugitives do the same thing it is what is it there is something in boldness and determination that for a time hushes even the rudest nature
marks was the only one who remained wholly untouched he was deliberately cocking his pistol and in the momentary silence that followed george_harris speech he fired at him
ye see ye get jist as much for him dead as alive in kentucky he said coolly as he wiped his pistol on his coat sleeve
george_harris sprang backward eliza_harris uttered a shriek the ball had passed close to his hair had nearly grazed the cheek of his wife and struck in the tree above
it nothing eliza_harris said george_harris quickly thee better keep out of sight with thy speechifying said phineas_fletcher they re mean scamps
now jim_crow said george_harris look that your pistols are all right and watch that pass with me the first man that shows himself i fire at you take the second and so on
it wont do you know to waste two shots on one but what if you dont hit i shall hit said george_harris coolly
good now there stuff in that fellow muttered phineas_fletcher between his teeth the party below after marks had fired stood for a moment rather undecided
i think you must have hit some on em said one of the man i heard a squeal
i going right up for one said tom_loker i never was afraid of nigger and i ant going to be now
he drew up his pistol examined it pointed it towards that point in the defile where the first man would appear
one of the most courageous of the party followed tom_loker and the way being thus made the whole party began pushing up the rock the hindermost pushing the front one faster than they would have gone of themselves
on they came and in a moment the burly form of tom_loker appeared in sight almost at the verge of the chasm
george_harris fired the shot entered his side but though wounded he would not retreat but with a yell like that of a mad bull he was leaping right across the chasm into the party
friend said phineas_fletcher suddenly stepping to the front and meeting him with a push from his long arm thee isnt wanted here
down he fell into the chasm crackling down among trees bushes logs loose stones till he lay bruised and groaning thirty foot below
the fall might have killed him had it not been broken and moderated by his clothes catching in the branches of a large tree but he came down with some force however more than was at all agreeable or convenient
lord help us they are perfect devils said marks heading the retreat down the rocks with much more of a will than he had joined the ascent while all the party came tumbling precipitately after him the fat constable in particular blowing and puffing in a very energetic manner
i say fellers said marks you jist go round and pick up tom_loker there while i run and get on to my horse to go back for help that you and without minding the hootings and jeers of his company marks was as good as his word and was soon seen galloping away
was ever such a sneaking varmint said one of the man to come on his business and he clear out and leave us this yer way
who goes after he said springing up the rocks george_harris heard the word distinctly well we must pick up that feller said another
the man led by the groans of tom_loker scrambled and crackled through stumps logs and bushes to where that hero lay groaning and swearing with alternate vehemence
cuss me if i much care whether he is dead or alive ye keep it agoing pretty loud tom_loker said one
ye much hurt dont know get me up cant ye blast that infernal quaker if it hadnt been for him i a pitched some on em down here to see how they liked it
with much labor and groaning the fallen hero was assisted to rise and with one holding him up under each shoulder they got him as far as the horse
if you could only get me a mile back to that ar tavern give me a handkerchief or something to stuff into this place and stop this infernal bleeding
george_harris looked over the rocks and saw them trying to lift the burly form of tom_loker into the saddle after two or three ineffectual attempts he reeled and fell heavily to the ground
i hope he isnt killed said eliza_harris who with all the party stood watching the proceeding why not said phineas_fletcher serves him right
yes said the old woman who had been groaning and praying in her methodist fashion during all the encounter it an awful case for the poor crittur soul
because after death comes the judgment said eliza_harris on my word they re leaving him i do believe said phineas_fletcher
it was true for after some appearance of irresolution and consultation the whole party got on their horse and rode away
when they were quite out of sight phineas_fletcher began to bestir himself well we must go down and walk a piece he said
i told michael to go forward and bring help and be along back here with the wagon but we shall have to walk a piece along the road i reckon to meet them
it early in the day there wont be much travel afoot yet a while we ant much more than two miles from our stopping place
the lord grant he be along soon if the road hadnt been so rough last night we could have outrun em entirely
as the party neared the fence they discovered in the distance along the road their own wagon coming back accompanied by some man on horseback
well now there michael and stephen and amariah exclaimed phineas_fletcher joyfully now we are made as safe as if we got there
well do stop then said eliza_harris and do something for that poor man he groaning dreadfully it would be no more than christian said george_harris let take him up and carry him on
here let have a look at him and phineas_fletcher who in the course of his hunting and backwoods life had acquired some rude experience of surgery kneeled down by the wounded man and began a careful examination of his condition
and doctor him up among the quakers said phineas_fletcher pretty well that well i dont care if we do
marks said tom_loker feebly is that you marks no i reckon tant friend said phineas_fletcher much marks care for thee if his own skin safe
he off long ago i believe i done for said tom_loker the cussed sneaking dog to leave me to die alone
my poor old mother always told met would be so la sakes jist hear the poor crittur he got a mammy now said the old negress
i cant help kinder pityin on him softly softly dont thee snap and snarl friend said phineas_fletcher as tom_loker winced and pushed his hand away
and phineas_fletcher busied himself with making some off hand surgical arrangements with his own pocket handkerchief and such as could be mustered in the company
thee has no chance unless i stop the bleeding you pushed me down there said tom_loker faintly
well if i hadnt thee would have pushed us down thee sees said phineas_fletcher as he stooped to apply his bandage
there there let me fix this bandage we mean well to thee we bear no malice thee shall be taken to a house where they ll nurse thee first rate well as thy own mother could
in man of his class vigor and resolution are entirely a physical matter and ooze out with the flowing of the blood and the gigantic fellow really looked piteous in his helplessness
the buffalo skins doubled in fours were spread all along one side and four man with great difficulty lifted the heavy form of tom_loker into it
tom_loker groaned and shut his eye the other party now came up the seats were taken out of the wagon before he was gotten in he fainted entirely
the old negress in the abundance of her compassion sat down on the bottom and took his head in her lap
eliza_harris george_harris and jim_crow bestowed themselves as well as they could in the remaining space and the whole party set forward
what do you think of him said george_harris who sat by phineas_fletcher in front well it only a pretty deep flesh wound but then tumbling and scratching down that place didnt help him much
it has bled pretty freely pretty much drained him out courage and all but he ll get over it and may be learn a thing or two by it
i glad to hear you say so said george_harris it would always be a heavy thought to me
if i caused his death even in a just cause yes said phineas_fletcher killing is an ugly operation any way they ll fix it man or beast
i ve seen a buck that was shot down and a dying look that way on a feller with his eye that it reely most made a feller feel wicked for killing on him and human creature is a more serious consideration yet bein as thy wife says that the judgment comes to em after death
so i dont know as our people notions on these matter is too strict and considerin how i was raised i fell in with them pretty considerably
what shall you do with this poor fellow said george_harris carry him along to amariah there old grandmam stephens there dorcas they call her she most an amazin nurse
she takes to nursing real natural and ant never better suited than when she gets a sick body to tend we may reckon on turning him over to her for a fortnight or so
a ride of about an hour more brought the party to a neat farmhouse where the weary travellers were received to an abundant breakfast
tom_loker was soon carefully deposited in a much cleaner and softer bed than he had ever been in the habit of occupying
his wound was carefully dressed and bandaged and he lay languidly opening and shutting his eye on the white window curtains and gently gliding figures of his sick room like a weary child
chapter xviii miss_ophelia experiences and opinions our friend tom_loker in his own simple musings often compared his more fortunate lot in the bondage into which he was cast with that of joseph in egypt and in fact as time went on and he developed more and more under the eye of his master the strength of the parallel increased
and here for the present we shall take our leave of one party augustine_st_clare was indolent and careless of money
hitherto the providing and marketing had been principally done by mr_adolph who was to the full as careless and extravagant as his master and between them both they had carried on the dispersing process with great alacrity
accustomed for many year to regard his master property as his own care tom_loker saw with an uneasiness he could scarcely repress the wasteful expenditure of the establishment and in the quiet indirect way which his class often acquire would sometimes make his own suggestions
augustine_st_clare at first employed him occasionally but struck with his soundness of mind and good business capacity he confided in him more and more till gradually all the marketing and providing for the family were intrusted to him
no no mr_adolph he said one day as mr_adolph was deprecating the passing of power out of his hand let tom_loker alone
you only understand what you want tom_loker understands cost and come to and there may be some end to money bye and bye if we dont let somebody do that
trusted to an unlimited extent by a careless master who handed him a bill without looking at it and pocketed the change without counting it tom_loker had every facility and temptation to dishonesty and nothing but an impregnable simplicity of nature strengthened by christian faith could have kept him from it
but to that nature the very unbounded trust reposed in him was bond and seal for the most scrupulous accuracy
thoughtless and self indulgent and unrestrained by a master who found it easier to indulge than to regulate he had fallen into an absolute confusion as to meum tuum with regard to himself and his master which sometimes troubled even augustine_st_clare
with mr_adolph the case had been different his own good sense taught him that such a training of his servant was unjust and dangerous
a sort of chronic remorse went with him everywhere although not strong enough to make any decided change in his course and this very remorse reacted again into indulgence
he passed lightly over the most serious faults because he told himself that if he had done his part his dependents had not fallen into them
that he never read the bible never went to church that he jested and made free with any and every thing that came in the way of his wit that he spent his sunday evening at the opera or theatre that he went to wine party and clubs and suppers oftener than was at all expedient were all thing that tom_loker could see as plainly as anybody and on which he based a conviction that mas wasnt a christian a conviction however which he would have been very slow to express to any one else but on which he founded many prayers in his own simple fashion when he was by himself in his little dormitory
not that tom_loker had not his own way of speaking his mind occasionally with something of the tact often observable in his class as for example the very day after the sabbath we have described augustine_st_clare was invited out to a convivial party of choice spirit and was helped home between one and two clock at night in a condition when the physical had decidedly attained the upper hand of the intellectual
tom_loker and mr_adolph assisted to get him composed for the night the latter in high spirit evidently regarding the matter as a good joke and laughing heartily at the rusticity of tom_loker horror who really was simple enough to lie awake most of the rest of the night praying for his young master
well tom_loker what are you waiting for said augustine_st_clare the next day as he sat in his library in dressing gown and slippers
tom_loker regarded his gay airy handsome young master with an odd mixture of fealty reverence and fatherly solicitude augustine_st_clare had just been entrusting tom_loker with some money and various commissions
isnt all right there tom_loker he added as tom_loker still stood waiting i fraid not mas said tom_loker with a grave face
augustine_st_clare laid down his paper and set down his coffee cup and looked at tom_loker why tom_loker what the case
you look as solemn as a coffin i feel very bad mas i allays have thought that mas would be good to everybody
well tom_loker havent i been come now what do you want there something you havent got i suppose and this is the preface
mas allays been good to me i havent nothing to complain of on that head but there is one that mas isnt good to
why tom_loker what got into you speak out what do you mean last night between one and two i thought so
i studied upon the matter then mas isnt good to himself tom_loker said this with his back to his master and his hand on the door knob
augustine_st_clare felt his face flush crimson but he laughed that all is it he said gayly all said tom_loker turning suddenly round and falling on his knees
my dear young mas i fraid it will be loss of all all body and soul the good book says it biteth like a serpent and stingeth like an adder
my dear mas tom_loker voice choked and the tear ran down his cheeks you poor silly fool said augustine_st_clare with tear in his own eye
get up tom_loker i not worth crying over but tom_loker wouldnt rise and looked imploring well i wont go to any more of their cursed nonsense tom_loker said augustine_st_clare on my honor i wont
i dont know why i havent stopped long ago i ve always despised it and myself for it so now tom_loker wipe up your eye and go about your errands
come come he added no blessings i not so wonderfully good now he said as he gently pushed tom_loker to the door
there i ll pledge my honor to you tom_loker you dont see me so again he said and tom_loker went off wiping his eye with great satisfaction
i ll keep my faith with him too said augustine_st_clare as he closed the door and augustine_st_clare did so for gross sensualism in any form was not the peculiar temptation of his nature
but all this time who shall detail the tribulations manifold of our friend miss_ophelia who had begun the labors of a southern housekeeper
there is all the difference in the world in the servant of southern establishments according to the character and capacity of the mistress who have brought them up
such are enabled with apparent ease and without severity to subject to their will and bring into harmonious and systematic order the various members of their small estate to regulate their peculiarities and so balance and compensate the deficiencies of one by the excess of another as to produce a harmonious and orderly system
such a housekeeper was mrs mr_shelby whom we have already described and such our readers may remember to have met with
south as well as north there are woman who have an extraordinary talent for command and tact in educating if they are not common at the south it is because they are not common in the world
they are to be found there as often as anywhere and when existing find in that peculiar state of society a brilliant opportunity to exhibit their domestic talent
indolent and childish unsystematic and improvident it was not to be expected that servant trained under her care should not be so likewise and she had very justly described to miss_ophelia the state of confusion she would find in the family though she had not ascribed it to the proper cause
the first morning of her regency miss_ophelia was up at four clock and having attended to all the adjustments of her own chamber as she had done ever since she came there to the great amazement of the chambermaid she prepared for a vigorous onslaught on the cupboards and closets of the establishment of which she had the keys
such a housekeeper marie_st_clare augustine_st_clare was not nor her mother before her the store room the linen presses the china closet the kitchen and cellar that day all went under an awful review
hidden thing of darkness were brought to light to an extent that alarmed all the principalities and power of kitchen and chamber and caused many wonderings and murmurings about dese yer northern lady from the domestic cabinet
old dinah the head cook and principal of all rule and authority in the kitchen department was filled with wrath at what she considered an invasion of privilege
dinah was a character in her own way and it would be injustice to her memory not to give the reader a little idea of her
she was a native and essential cook as much as aunt_chloe cooking being an indigenous talent of the african race but aunt_chloe was a trained and methodical one who moved in an orderly domestic harness while dinah was a self taught genius and like geniuses in general was positive opinionated and erratic to the last degree
like a certain class of modern philosophers dinah perfectly scorned logic and reason in every shape and always took refuge in intuitive certainty and here she was perfectly impregnable
no possible amount of talent or authority or explanation could ever make her believe that any other way was better than her own or that the course she had pursued in the smallest matter could be in the least modified
this had been a conceded point with her old mistress marie_st_clare mother and miss marie_st_clare as dinah always called her young mistress even after her marriage found it easier to submit than contend and so dinah had ruled supreme
this was the easier in that she was perfect mistress of that diplomatic art which unites the utmost subservience of manner with the utmost inflexibility as to measure
no feudal baron in magna charta time could have more thoroughly resented some incursion of the crown dinah was mistress of the whole art and mystery of excuse making in all its branches
indeed it was an axiom with her that the cook can do no wrong and a cook in a southern kitchen finds abundance of head and shoulders on which to lay off every sin and frailty so as to maintain her own immaculateness entire
if any part of the dinner was a failure there were fifty indisputably good reasons for it and it was the fault undeniably of fifty other people whom dinah berated with unsparing zeal
but it was very seldom that there was any failure in dinah last results though her mode of doing everything was peculiarly meandering and circuitous and without any sort of calculation as to time
her kitchen generally looked as if it had been arranged by a hurricane blowing through it and she had about as many place for each cooking utensil as there were day in the year yet
if one would have patience to wait her own good time up would come her dinner in perfect order and in a style of preparation with which an epicure could find no fault
dinah who required large intervals of reflection and repose and was studious of ease in all her arrangements was seated on the kitchen floor smoking a short stumpy pipe to which she was much addicted and which she always kindled up as a sort of censer whenever she felt the need of an inspiration in her arrangements
and place though it was now the season of incipient preparation for dinner it was dinah mode of invoking the domestic muses
seated around her were various members of that rising race with which a southern household abounds engaged in shelling peas peeling potatoes picking pin feathers out of fowls and other preparatory arrangements dinah every once in a while interrupting her meditations to give a poke or a rap on the head to some of the young operators with the pudding stick that lay by her side
in fact dinah ruled over the woolly head of the younger members with a rod of iron and seemed to consider them born for no earthly purpose but to save her steps as she phrased it
it was the spirit of the system under which she had grown up and she carried it out to its full extent
dinah had heard from various sources what was going on and resolved to stand on defensive and conservative ground mentally determined to oppose and ignore every new measure without any actual observable contest
the kitchen was a large brick floored apartment with a great old fashioned fireplace stretching along one side of it an arrangement which augustine_st_clare had vainly tried to persuade dinah to exchange for the convenience of a modern cook stove
miss_ophelia after passing on her reformatory tour through all the other part of the establishment now entered the kitchen not she
edward bouverie pusey champion of the orthodoxy of revealed religion defender of the oxford movement and regius professor of hebrew and canon of jesus_christ church oxford
when augustine_st_clare had first returned from the north impressed with the system and order of his uncle kitchen arrangements he had largely provided his own with an array of cupboards drawers and various apparatus to induce systematic regulation under the sanguine illusion that it would be of any possible assistance to dinah in her arrangements
no puseyite or conservative of any school was ever more inflexibly attached to time honored inconveniences than dinah he might as well have provided them for a squirrel or a magpie
the more drawers and closets there were the more hiding holes could dinah make for the accommodation of old rags hair combs old shoes ribbons cast off artificial flowers and other articles of vertu wherein her soul delighted
when miss_ophelia entered the kitchen dinah did not rise but smoked on in sublime tranquillity regarding her movements obliquely out of the corner of her eye but apparently intent only on the operations around her
miss_ophelia commenced opening a set of drawers what is this drawer for dinah she said it handy for most anything missis said dinah
from the variety it contained miss_ophelia pulled out first a fine damask table cloth stained with blood having evidently been used to envelop some raw meat
so it appeared to be what this dinah you dont wrap up meat in your mistress best table cloths lor missis no the towels was all a missin so
shif less said miss_ophelia to herself proceeding to tumble over the drawer where she found a nutmeg grater and two or three nutmegs a methodist hymn book a couple of soiled madras handkerchiefs some yarn and knitting work a paper of tobacco and a pipe a few crackers one or two gilded china saucers with some pomade in them one or two thin old shoes a piece of flannel carefully pinned up enclosing some small white onions several damask table napkins some coarse crash towels some twine and darning needles and several broken paper from which sundry sweet herbs were sifting into the drawer
i jest did it i laid out to wash that a that why i put it thar where do you keep your nutmegs dinah said miss_ophelia with the air of one who prayed for patience
most anywhar missis there some in that cracked tea cup up there and there some over in that ar cupboard
here are some in the grater said miss_ophelia holding them up law yes i put em there this morning i likes to keep my thing handy said dinah
you jake what are you stopping for you ll cotch it be still thar she added with a dive of her stick at the criminal
what this said miss_ophelia holding up the saucer of pomade law it my har grease i put it thar to have it handy
do you use your mistress best saucers for that law it was cause i was driv and in sich a hurry i was gwine to change it this very day
here are two damask table napkins them table napkins i put thar to get em washed out some day dont you have some place here on purpose for thing to be washed
well mas augustine_st_clare got dat ar chest he said for dat but i likes to mix up biscuit and hev my thing on it some day and then it ant handy a liftin up the lid
why dont you mix your biscuits on the pastry table there law missis it gets sot so full of dishes and one thing and another der an t
wash my dishes said dinah in a high key as her wrath began to rise over her habitual respect of manner what does lady know bout work i want to know
when mas ever get his dinner if i vas to spend all my time a washin and a puttin up dishes
no room noway but you should wash your dishes and clear them away miss marie_st_clare never telled me so nohow
well here are these onions law yes said dinah thar is whar i put em now i couldnt member
them particular onions i was a savin for dis yer very stew i forgot they was in dat ar old flannel
miss_ophelia lifted out the sifting paper of sweet herbs i wish missis wouldnt touch dem ar i likes to keep my thing where i knows whar to go to em said dinah rather decidedly
but you dont want these holes in the paper them handy for siftin ont out said dinah
but you see it spills all over the drawer law yes if missis will go a tumblin thing all up so it will
if missis only will go up stars till my clarin up time comes i ll have everything right but i cant do nothing when lady is round a henderin
missis has spilt lots dat ar way said dinah coming uneasily to the drawers you sam dont you gib the baby dat ar sugar bowl
i going through the kitchen and going to put everything in order once dinah and then i ll expect you to keep it so
i ll crack ye over if ye dont mind lor now miss phelia dat ar ant no way for lady to do
i never did see lady doin no sich my old missis nor miss marie_st_clare never did and i dont see no kinder need ont and dinah stalked indignantly about while miss_ophelia piled and sorted dishes emptied dozens of scattering bowls of sugar into one receptacle sorted napkins table cloths and towels for washing washing wiping and arranging with her own hand and with a speed and alacrity which perfectly amazed dinah
if dat ar de way dem northern lady do dey ant lady nohow she said to some of her satellites when at a safe hearing distance
i has thing as straight as anybody when my clarin up time comes but i dont want lady round a henderin and getting my thing all where i cant find em
to do dinah justice she had at irregular periods paroxyms of reformation and arrangement which she called clarin up time when she would begin with great zeal and turn every drawer and closet wrong side outward on to the floor or table and make the ordinary confusion seven fold more confounded
then she would light her pipe and leisurely go over her arrangements looking thing over and discoursing upon them making all the young fry scour most vigorously on the tin thing and keeping up for several hour a most energetic state of confusion which she would explain to the satisfaction of all inquirers by the remark that she was a clarin up
she couldnt hev thing a gwine on so as they had been and she was gwine to make these yer young one keep better order for dinah herself somehow indulged the illusion that she herself was the soul of order and it was only the young uns and the everybody else in the house that were the cause of anything that fell short of perfection in this respect
when all the tins were scoured and the table scrubbed snowy white and everything that could offend tucked out of sight in holes and corners dinah would dress herself up in a smart dress clean apron and high brilliant madras turban and tell all marauding young uns to keep out of the kitchen for she was gwine to have thing kept nice
indeed these periodic seasons were often an inconvenience to the whole household for dinah would contract such an immoderate attachment to her scoured tin as to insist upon it that it shouldnt be used again for any possible purpose at least till the ardor of the clarin up period abated
miss_ophelia in a few day thoroughly reformed every department of the house to a systematic pattern but her labors in all departments that depended on the cooperation of servant were like those of sisyphus or the danaides
lor now in despair she one day appealed to augustine_st_clare there is no such thing as getting anything like a system in this family
to be sure there isnt said augustine_st_clare such shiftless management such waste such confusion i never saw i dare say you didnt
my dear cousin you may as well understand once for all that we master are divided into two classes oppressors and oppressed
you would not take it so coolly if you were housekeeper we who are good natured and hate severity make up our mind to a good deal of inconvenience
if we will keep a shambling loose untaught set in the community for our convenience why we must take the consequence
some rare case i have seen of persons who by a peculiar tact can produce order and system without severity but i not one of them and
i will not have the poor devils thrashed and cut to pieces and they know it and of course they know the staff is in their own hand
so i made up my mind long ago to let thing go just as they do but to have no time no place no order all going on in this shiftless way
what on earth is the use of time to a fellow who has twice as much of it as he knows what to do with
as to order and system where there is nothing to be done but to lounge on the sofa and read an hour sooner or later in breakfast or dinner isnt of much account
my dear vermont you natives up by the north pole set an extravagant value on time now there dinah gets you a capital dinner soup ragout roast fowl dessert ice creams
and all and she creates it all out of chaos and old night down there in that kitchen i think it really sublime the way she manages
but heaven bless us if we are to go down there and view all the smoking and squatting about and hurryscurryation of the preparatory process we should never eat more
my good cousin absolve yourself from that it more than a catholic penance and does no more good you ll only lose your own temper and utterly confound dinah
let her go her own way but augustine_st_clare you dont know how i found thing dont i dont i know that the rolling pin is under her bed and the nutmeg grater in her pocket with her tobacco that
there are sixty five different sugar bowls one in every hole in the house that she washes dishes with a dinner napkin one day and with a fragment of an old petticoat the next
but the upshot is she gets up glorious dinners makes superb coffee and you must judge her as warriors and statesmen are judged by her success
but the waste the expense well lock everything you can and keep the key give out by driblets and never inquire for odds and ends it isnt best
that troubles me augustine_st_clare i cant help feeling as if these servant were not strictly honest are you sure they can be relied on
augustine_st_clare laughed immoderately at the grave and anxious face with which miss_ophelia propounded the question cousin that too good honest
as if that a thing to be expected honest why of course they arnt why should they be what upon earth is to make them so
as to marie_st_clare she has spirit enough to be sure to kill off a whole plantation if i let her manage but she wouldnt get the cheatery out of them
why dont you instruct instruct fiddlestick what instructing do you think i should do i look like it are there no honest one
well now and then one whom nature makes so impracticably simple truthful and faithful that the worst possible influence cant destroy it
but you see from the mother breast the colored child feels and sees that there are none but underhand way open to it
it can get along no other way with its parents its mistress its young master and missie play fellow cunning and deception become necessary inevitable habits
as to honesty the slave is kept in that dependent semi childish state that there is no making him realize the rights of property or feel that his master goods are not his own if he can get them
it isnt fair to expect anything else of him he ought not to be punished for it for my part i dont see how they can be honest
such a fellow as tom_loker here is is a moral miracle and what becomes of their soul said miss_ophelia
that isnt my affair as i know of said augustine_st_clare i am only dealing in fact of the present life
the fact is that the whole race are pretty generally understood to be turned over to the devil for our benefit in this world however it may turn out in another
this is perfectly horrible said miss_ophelia you ought to be ashamed of yourselves i dont know as i am
look at the high and the low all the world over and it the same story the lower class used up body soul and spirit for the good of the upper
it is so in england it is so everywhere and yet all christendom stands aghast with virtuous indignation because we do the thing in a little different shape from what they do it
we are in pretty good company for all that said augustine_st_clare as people in the broad road generally are it isnt so in vermont
but there the bell so cousin let us for a while lay aside our sectional prejudices and come out to dinner
as miss_ophelia was in the kitchen in the latter part of the afternoon some of the sable child called out la sakes
ah well in new england and in the free state you have the better of us i grant thar prue a coming grunting along like she allers does
a tall bony colored woman now entered the kitchen bearing on her head a basket of rusks and hot rolls
ho prue you ve come said dinah prue had a peculiar scowling expression of countenance and a sullen grumbling voice she set down her basket squatted herself down and resting her elbows on her knees said lord
i wisht i dead why do you wish you were dead said miss_ophelia i be out my misery said the woman gruffly without taking her eye from the floor
what need you getting drunk then and cutting up prue said a spruce quadroon chambermaid dangling as she spoke a pair of coral ear drops
the woman looked at her with a sour surly glance maybe you ll come to it one of these yer day
i be glad to see you i would then you ll be glad of a drop like me to forget your misery
come prue said dinah let look at your rusks here missis will pay for them miss_ophelia took out a couple of dozen
thar some tickets in that ar old cracked jug on the top shelf said dinah you jake climb up and get it down
tickets what are they for said miss_ophelia we buy tickets of her mas and she gives us bread for em
and they counts my money and tickets when i gets home to see if i got the change and if i hant they half kills me
and serves you right said jane the pert chambermaid if you will take their money to get drunk on
that what she does missis and that what i will do i cant live no other way drink and forget my misery
you are very wicked and very foolish said miss_ophelia to steal your master money to make yourself a brute with
i wish i dead i do i wish i dead and out of my misery and slowly and stiffly the old creature rose and got her basket on her head again but before she went out she looked at the quadroon girl who still stood playing with her ear drops
ye think ye re mighty fine with them ar a frolickin and a tossin your head and a lookin down on everybody
it mighty likely missis but i will do it yes i will lord well never mind you may live to be a poor old cut up crittur like me
hope to the lord ye will i do then see if ye wont drink drink drink yerself into torment and sarve ye right too ugh
and with a malignant howl the woman left the room disgusting old beast said mr_adolph who was getting his master shaving water
if i was her master i cut her up worse than she is ye couldnt do that ar no way said dinah
her back a far sight now she cant never get a dress together over it i think such low creature ought not to be allowed to go round to genteel family said miss jane
it must be observed that among other appropriations from his master stock mr_adolph was in the habit of adopting his name and address and that the style under which he moved among the colored circles of new orleans was that of mr augustine_st_clare
what do you think mr augustine_st_clare she said coquettishly tossing her head at mr_adolph i certainly of your opinion miss benoir said mr_adolph
benoir was the name of marie_st_clare augustine_st_clare family and jane was one of her servant pray miss benoir may i be allowed to ask if those drops are for the ball tomorrow night
i wonder now mr augustine_st_clare what the impudence of you man will come to said jane tossing her pretty head til the ear drops twinkled again
they are certainly bewitching i shant dance with you for a whole evening if you go to asking me any more questions
you couldnt be so cruel now i was just dying to know whether you would appear in your pink tarletane said mr_adolph
what is it said miss_rosa a bright piquant little quadroon who came skipping down stairs at this moment why mr augustine_st_clare so impudent
i know he always a saucy creature said miss_rosa poising herself on one of her little foot and looking maliciously at mr_adolph
on my honor said mr_adolph i ll leave it to miss_rosa now he always getting me so angry with him
lady ladies you will certainly break my heart between you said mr_adolph i shall be found dead in my bed some morning and you ll have it to answer for
do hear the horrid creature talk said both lady laughing immoderately come clar out you i cant have you cluttering up the kitchen said dinah in my way foolin round here
aunt dinah glum because she cant go to the ball said miss_rosa dont want none your light colored balls said dinah cuttin round makin lieve you white folks
arter all you nigger much as i am aunt dinah greases her wool stiff every day to make it lie straight said jane
and it will be wool after all said miss_rosa maliciously shaking down her long silky curls well in the lord sight ant wool as good as har any time said dinah
i like to have missis say which is worth the most a couple such as you or one like me get out wid
augustine_st_clare voice was heard at the head of the stairs asking mr_adolph if he meant to stay all night with his shaving water and miss_ophelia coming out of the dining room said jane and miss_rosa what are you wasting your time for here
ye ye trumpery i wont have ye round here the conversation was interrupted in a two fold manner go in and attend to your muslins
our friend tom_loker who had been in the kitchen during the conversation with the old rusk woman had followed her out into the street
at last she set her basket down on a doorstep and began arranging the old faded shawl which covered her shoulders
he saw her go on giving every once in a while a suppressed groan i ll carry your basket a piece said tom_loker compassionately
why should ye said the woman i dont want no help you seem to be sick or in trouble or somethin said tom_loker
i ant sick said the woman shortly i wish said tom_loker looking at her earnestly i wish i could persuade you to leave off drinking
dont you know it will be the ruin of ye body and soul i knows i gwine to torment said the woman sullenly
ye dont need to tell me that ar i ugly i wicked i gwine straight to torment lord
i wish i thar tom_loker shuddered at these frightful word spoken with a sullen impassioned earnestness lord have mercy on ye
poor crittur hant ye never heard of lord_jesus jesus_christ lord_jesus jesus_christ who he why he the lord said tom_loker i think i ve hearn tell the lord and the judgment and torment
i ve heard that but didnt anybody ever tell you of the lord_jesus that loved us poor sinners and died for us
dont know nothing bout that said the woman nobody hant never loved me since my old man died where was you raised said tom_loker
a man kept me to breed chil en for market and sold em as fast as they got big enough last of all he sold me to a speculator and my mas got me him
up in kentuck what set you into this bad way of drinkin to get shet my misery
i had one child after i come here and i thought then i have one to raise cause mas wasnt a speculator
it was de peartest little thing and missis she seemed to think a heap ont at first it never cried it was likely and fat
but missis tuck sick and i tended her and i tuck the fever and my milk all left me and the child it pined to skin and bone and missis wouldnt buy milk for it
she said she knowed i could feed it on what other folks eat and the child kinder pined and cried and cried and cried day and night and got all gone to skin and bones and missis got sot agin it
she wished it was dead she said and she wouldnt let me have it night cause she said it kept me awake and made me good for nothing
she made me sleep in her room and i had to put it away off in a little kind garret and thar it cried itself to death one night
she wouldnt hear to me when i telled her i hadnt milk and she saidt want nothing but crossness it did and i tuck to drinkin to keep its crying out of my ear
i did and i will drink i will if i do go to torment for it mas says i shall go to torment and i tell him i ve got thar now
ye poor crittur said tom_loker hant nobody never telled ye how the lord_jesus loved ye and died for ye
hant they telled ye that he ll help ye and ye can go to heaven and have rest at last i looks like gwine to heaven said the woman ant thar where white folks is gwine
i had so she said as with her usual groan she got her basket on her head and walked sullenly away
s pose they have me thar i rather go to torment and get away from mas and missis tom_loker turned and walked sorrowfully back to the house
in the court he met little miss_eva a crown of tuberoses on her head and her eye radiant with delight tom_loker here you are
papa says you may get out the ponies and take me in my little new carriage she said catching his hand
i glad i ve found you but what the matter tom_loker you look sober i feel bad miss_eva said tom_loker sorrowfully
but i ll get the horse for you but do tell me tom_loker what is the matter i saw you talking to cross old prue
tom_loker in simple earnest phrase told miss_eva the woman history she did not exclaim or wonder or weep as other child do
her cheeks grew pale and a deep earnest shadow passed over her eye she laid both hand on her bosom and sighed heavily
volume ii chapter xix miss_ophelia experiences and opinions continued tom_loker you neednt get me the horse i dont want to go she said
why not miss_eva these thing sink into my heart tom_loker said miss_eva they sink into my heart she repeated earnestly
a few day after another woman came in old prue place to bring the rusks miss_ophelia was in the kitchen
i dont want to go and she turned from tom_loker and went into the house lor said dinah what got prue
prue isnt coming any more said the woman mysteriously why not said dinah she ant dead is she we doesnt exactly know
she down cellar said the woman glancing at miss_ophelia after miss_ophelia had taken the rusks dinah followed the woman to the door
what has got prue any how she said the woman seemed desirous yet reluctant to speak and answered in low mysterious tone
well you mustnt tell nobody prue she got drunk agin and they had her down cellar and thar they left her all
dinah held up her hand and turning saw close by her side the spirit like form of evangeline her large mystic eye dilated with horror and every drop of blood driven from her lips and cheeks
day and i hearn em saying that the flies had got to her and she dead lor bless us
miss_eva gwine to faint away what go us all to let her har such talk her pa ll be rail mad
i shant faint dinah said the child firmly and why shouldnt i hear it it ant so much for me to hear it as for poor prue to suffer it
lor sakes it isnt for sweet delicate young lady like you these yer stories isnt it enough to kill em
dinah gave a very garrulous version of it to which tom_loker added the particulars which he had drawn from her that morning
miss_eva sighed again and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step miss_ophelia anxiously inquired the woman story
an abominable business perfectly horrible she exclaimed as she entered the room where augustine_st_clare lay reading his paper pray what iniquity has turned up now said he
why those folks have whipped prue to death said miss_ophelia going on with great strength of detail into the story and enlarging on its most shocking particulars
what now i thought it would come to that some time said augustine_st_clare going on with his paper
thought so ant you going to do anything about it said miss_ophelia havent you got any selectmen or anybody to interfere and look after such matter
it commonly supposed that the property interest is a sufficient guard in these case if people choose to ruin their own possessions i dont know what to be done
it seems the poor creature was a thief and a drunkard and so there wont be much hope to get up sympathy for her
it is perfectly outrageous it is horrid augustine_st_clare it will certainly bring down vengeance upon you my dear cousin i didnt do it and i cant help it i would if i could
if low minded brutal people will act like themselves what am i to do they have absolute control they are irresponsible despots
there would be no use in interfering there is no law that amounts to anything practically for such a case the best we can do is to shut our eye and ear and let it alone
it the only resource left us how can you shut your eye and ear how can you let such thing alone
here is a whole class debased uneducated indolent provoking put without any sort of terms or conditions entirely into the hand of such people as the majority in our world are people who have neither consideration nor self control who havent even an enlightened regard to their own interest for
of course in a community so organized what can a man of honorable and humane feeling do but shut his eye all he can and harden his heart
my dear child what do you expect that the case with the largest half of mankind i cant buy every poor wretch i see
i cant turn knight errant and undertake to redress every individual case of wrong in such a city as this the most i can do is to try and keep out of the way of it
augustine_st_clare fine countenance was for a moment overcast he said come cousin dont stand there looking like one of the fates you ve only seen a peep through the curtain a specimen of what is going on the world over in some shape or other
if we are to be prying and spying into all the dismals of life we should have no heart to anything
t is like looking too close into the details of dinah kitchen and augustine_st_clare lay back on the sofa and busied himself with his paper
she knit and knit but while she mused the fire burned at last she broke out i tell you augustine_st_clare i cant get over thing
miss_ophelia sat down and pulled out her knitting work and sat there grim with indignation so if you can it a perfect abomination for you to defend such a system that my mind
what now said augustine_st_clare looking up at it again hey i say it perfectly abominable for you to defend such a system said miss_ophelia with increasing warmth
i defend it my dear lady who ever said i did defend it said augustine_st_clare of course you defend it you all do all you southerners
are you such a sweet innocent as to suppose nobody in this world ever does what they dont think is right
what do you have slave for if you dont dont you or didnt you ever do anything that you did not think quite right
if i do i repent of it i hope said miss_ophelia rattling her needles with energy so do i said augustine_st_clare peeling his orange
i repenting of it all the time what do you keep on doing it for didnt you ever keep on doing wrong after you repented my good cousin
well only when i ve been very much tempted said miss_ophelia well i very much tempted said augustine_st_clare
well i have been resolving i wont off and on these ten year said augustine_st_clare but i havent some how got clear
that just my difficulty but i always resolve i wont and i try to break off have you got clear of all your sins cousin
cousin augustine_st_clare said miss_ophelia seriously and laying down her knitting work i suppose i deserve that you should reprove my short comings
i know all you say is true enough nobody else feels them more than i do but it does seem to me after all there is some difference between me and you
it seems to me i would cut off my right hand sooner than keep on from day to day doing what i thought was wrong
now cousin said augustine_st_clare sitting down on the floor and laying his head back in her lap dont take on so awfully serious
but then my conduct is so inconsistent with my profession i dont wonder you reprove me you know what a good for nothing saucy boy i always was
i love to poke you up that all just to see you get earnest i do think you are desperately distressingly good it tires me to death to think of it
but this is a serious subject my boy auguste said miss_ophelia laying her hand on his forehead dismally so said he and i well i never want to talk seriously in hot weather
what with mosquitos and all a fellow cant get himself up to any very sublime moral flights and i believe said
augustine_st_clare suddenly rousing himself up there a theory now i understand now why northern nations are always more virtuous than southern one i see into that whole subject
well so i am i suppose but for once i will be serious now but you must hand me that basket of oranges you see you ll have to stay me with flagons and comfort me with apples if i going to make this effort
when in the course of human events it becomes necessary for a fellow to hold two or three dozen of his fellow worms in captivity a decent regard to the opinions of society requires
augustine_st_clare you are a sad rattle brain am i now said augustine_st_clare drawing the basket up i ll begin i dont see that you are growing more serious said miss_ophelia
the short of the matter is cousin said he his handsome face suddenly settling into an earnest and serious expression on this abstract question of slavery there can as i think be but one opinion
planters who have money to make by it clergymen who have planters to please politicians who want to rule by it may warp and bend language and ethics to a degree that shall astonish the world at their ingenuity they can press nature and the bible and nobody knows what else into the service but after all neither they nor the world believe in it one particle the more
it comes from the devil that the short of it and to my mind it a pretty respectable specimen of what he can do in his own line
wait i coming on you ll hear miss_ophelia stopped her knitting and looked surprised and augustine_st_clare apparently enjoying her astonishment went on
you seem to wonder but if you will get me fairly at it i ll make a clean breast of it
strip it of all its ornament run it down to the root and nucleus of the whole and what is it
why because my brother quashy is ignorant and weak and i am intelligent and strong because i know how and can do it therefore i may steal all he has keep it and give him only such and so much as suits my fancy
this cursed business accursed of god and man what is it whatever is too hard too dirty too disagreeable for me i may set quashy to doing
because i dont like work quashy shall work because the sun burns me quashy shall stay in the sun quashy shall earn the money and i will spend it
quashy shall do my will and not his all the day of his mortal life and have such chance of getting to heaven at last as i find convenient
quashy shall lie down in every puddle that i may walk over dry shod this i take to be about what slavery is
i defy anybody on earth to read our slave code as it stands in our law book and make anything else of it
and the only reason why the land dont sink under it like sodom and gomorrah is because it is used in a way infinitely better than it is
for pity sake for shame sake because we are man born of woman and not savage beasts many of us do not and dare not we would scorn to use the full power which our savage law put into our hand
and he who goes the furthest and does the worst only uses within limits the power that the law gives him
augustine_st_clare had started up and as his manner was when excited was walking with hurried steps up and down the floor
talk of the abuses of slavery humbug the thing itself is the essence of all abuse his fine face classic as that of a greek statue seemed actually to burn with the fervor of his feeling
his large blue eye flashed and he gestured with an unconscious eagerness miss_ophelia had never seen him in this mood before and she sat perfectly silent
i declare to you said he suddenly stopping before his cousin it no sort of use to talk or to feel on this subject but i declare to you there have been time when i have thought if the whole country would sink and hide all this injustice and misery from the light i would willingly sink with it
when i have been travelling up and down on our boat or about on my collecting tours and reflected that every brutal disgusting mean low lived fellow i met was allowed by our law to become absolute despot of as many man woman and child as he could cheat steal or gamble money enough to buy when i have seen such man in actual ownership of helpless child of young girl and woman i have been ready to curse my country to curse the human race
augustine_st_clare augustine said miss_ophelia i sure you ve said enough i never in my life heard anything like this even at the north
at the north said augustine_st_clare with a sudden change of expression and resuming something of his habitual careless tone
pooh your northern folks are cold blooded you are cool in everything you cant begin to curse up hill and down as we can when we get fairly at it
well but the question is said miss_ophelia yes to be sure the question is and a deuce of a question it is
how came you in this state of sin and misery well i shall answer in the good old word you used to teach me sundays
my servant were my father and what is more my mother and now they are mine they and their increase which bids fair to be a pretty considerable item
i came so by ordinary generation my father you know came first from new england and he was just such another man as your father a
your father settled down in new england to rule over rocks and stones and to force an existence out of nature and mine settled in louisiana to rule over man and woman and force existence out of them
my mother said augustine_st_clare getting up and walking to a picture at the end of the room and gazing upward with a face fervent with veneration she was divine
she probably was of mortal birth but as far as ever i could observe there was no trace of any human weakness or error about her and everybody that life to remember her whether bond or free servant acquaintance relation all say the same
regular old roman upright energetic noble minded with an iron will dont look at me so you know what i mean why cousin that mother has been all that has stood between me and utter unbelief for year
she was a direct embodiment and personification of the new testament a living fact to be accounted for and to be accounted for in no other way than by its truth
mother said augustine_st_clare clasping his hand in a sort of transport and then suddenly checking himself he came back and seating himself on an ottoman
he went on my brother and i were twins and they say you know that twins ought to resemble each other but we were in all points a contrast
o mother he had black fiery eye coal black hair a strong fine roman profile and a rich brown complexion i had blue eye golden hair a greek outline and fair complexion
he was generous to his friend and equals but proud dominant overbearing to inferiors and utterly unmerciful to whatever set itself up against him
he was active and observing i dreamy and inactive truthful we both were he from pride and courage i from a sort of abstract ideality
we loved each other about as boy generally do off and on and in general he was my father pet and i my mother
there was a morbid sensitiveness and acuteness of feeling in me on all possible subjects of which he and my father had no kind of understanding and with which they could have no possible sympathy
but mother did and so when i had quarreled with alfred and father looked sternly on me i used to go off to mother room and sit by her
i remember just how she used to look with her pale cheeks her deep soft serious eye her white dress she always wore white and i used to think of her whenever i read in revelations about the saints that were arrayed in fine linen clean and white
she had a great deal of genius of one sort and another particularly in music and she used to sit at her organ playing fine old majestic music of the catholic church and singing with a voice more like an angel than a mortal woman and i would lay my head down on her lap and cry and dream and feel oh immeasurably thing that i had no language to say
in those day this matter of slavery had never been canvassed as it has now nobody dreamed of any harm in it
i think in some preexistent state he must have been in the higher circles of spirit and brought all his old court pride along with him for it was ingrain bred in the bone though he was originally of poor and not in any way of noble family
my father was a born aristocrat my brother was begotten in his image now an aristocrat you know the world over has no human sympathies beyond a certain line in society
in england the line is in one place in burmah in another and in america in another but the aristocrat of all these country never goes over it
what would be hardship and distress and injustice in his own class is a cool matter of course in another one
among his equals never was a man more just and generous but he considered the negro through all possible gradations of color as an intermediate link between man and animals and graded all his ideas of justice or generosity on this hypothesis
i suppose to be sure if anybody had asked him plump and fair whether they had human immortal soul he might have hemmed and hawed and said yes
but my father was not a man much troubled with spiritualism religious sentiment he had none beyond a veneration for god as decidedly the head of the upper classes
well my father worked some five hundred negroes he was an inflexible driving punctilious business man everything was to move by system to be sustained with unfailing accuracy and precision
now if you take into account that all this was to be worked out by a set of lazy twaddling shiftless laborers who had grown up all their life in the absence of every possible motive to learn how to do anything but shirk as you vermonters say and you ll see that there might naturally be on his plantation a great many thing that looked horrible and distressing to a sensitive child like me
my father dividing line was that of color besides all he had an overseer great tall slab sided two fisted renegade son of vermont begging
your pardon who had gone through a regular apprenticeship in hardness and brutality and taken his degree to be admitted to practice
my mother never could endure him nor i but he obtained an entire ascendency over my father and this man was the absolute despot of the estate
i was a little fellow then but i had the same love that i have now for all kind of human thing a kind of passion for the study of humanity come in what shape it would
i was found in the cabins and among the field hand a great deal and of course was a great favorite and all sort of complaints and grievances were breathed in my ear and i told them to mother and we between us formed a sort of committee for a redress of grievances
we hindered and repressed a great deal of cruelty and congratulated ourselves on doing a vast deal of good till as often happens my zeal overacted
father was a fond indulgent husband but a man that never flinched from anything that he thought necessary and so he put down his foot like a rock between us and the field hand
he told my mother in language perfectly respectful and deferential but quite explicit that over the house servant she should be entire mistress but that with the field hand he could allow no interference
he revered and respected her above all living beings but he would have said it all the same to the virgin mary herself if she had come in the way of his system
stubbs complained to my father that he couldnt manage the hand and must resign his position i used sometimes to hear my mother reasoning case with him endeavoring to excite his sympathies
he would listen to the most pathetic appeals with the most discouraging politeness and equanimity it all resolves itself into this he would say must i part with stubbs or keep him
we cant have perfection and if i keep him i must sustain his administration as a whole even if there are now and then thing that are exceptionable
stubbs is the soul of punctuality honesty and efficiency a thorough business hand and as humane as the general run all government includes some necessary hardness
general rules will bear hard on particular case this last maxim my father seemed to consider a settler in most alleged case of cruelty
after he had said that he commonly drew up his foot on the sofa like a man that has disposed of a business and betook himself to a nap or the newspaper as the case might be
he could have divided poland as easily as an orange or trod on ireland as quietly and systematically as any man living
the fact is my father showed the exact sort of talent for a statesman at last my mother gave up in despair
it never will be known till the last account what noble and sensitive nature like hers have felt cast utterly helpless into what seems to them an abyss of injustice and cruelty and which seems so to nobody about them
it has been an age of long sorrow of such nature in such a hell begotten sort of world as ours what remained for her but to train her child in her own views and sentiments
from the cradle alfred was an aristocrat and as he grew up instinctively all his sympathies and all his reasonings were in that line and all mother exhortations went to the winds
well after all you say about training child will grow up substantially what they are by nature and only that as to me they sunk deep into me
she never contradicted in form anything my father said or seemed directly to differ from him but she impressed burnt into my very soul with all the force of her deep earnest nature an idea of the dignity and worth of the meanest human soul
i have looked in her face with solemn awe when she would point up to the stars in the evening and say to me see there auguste
the poorest meanest soul on our place will be living when all these stars are gone forever will live as long as god life
she had some fine old paintings one in particular of lord_jesus healing a blind man they were very fine and used to impress me strongly
see there auguste she would say the blind man was a beggar poor and loathsome therefore he would not heal him afar off
he called him to him and put his hand on him remember this my boy if i had lived to grow up under her care she might have stimulated me to
i know not what of enthusiasm i might have been a saint reformer martyr but alas alas i went from her when i was only thirteen and i never saw her again
augustine_st_clare rested his head on his hand and did not speak for some minutes after a while he looked up and went on what poor mean trash this whole business of human virtue is
a mere matter for the most part of latitude and longitude and geographical position acting with natural temperament the greater part is nothing but an accident
your father for example settles in vermont in a town where all are in fact free and equal becomes a regular church member and deacon and in due time joins an abolition society and thinks us all little better than heathens
yet he is for all the world in constitution and habit a duplicate of my father i can see it leaking out in fifty different way just the same strong overbearing dominant spirit
you know very well how impossible it is to persuade some of the folks in your village that squire sinclair does not feel above them
the fact is though he has fallen on democratic time and embraced a democratic theory he is to the heart an aristocrat as much as my father who ruled over five or six hundred slave
miss_ophelia felt rather disposed to cavil at this picture and was laying down her knitting to begin but augustine_st_clare stopped her
now i know every word you are going to say i do not say they were alike in fact
one fell into a condition where everything acted against the natural tendency and the other where everything acted for it and so one turned out a pretty wilful stout overbearing old democrat and the other a wilful stout old despot
if both had owned plantation in louisiana they would have been as like as two old bullets cast in the same mould
what an undutiful boy you are said miss_ophelia i dont mean them any disrespect said augustine_st_clare
but to go back to my history when father died he left the whole property to us twin boy to be divided as we should agree
there does not breathe on god earth a nobler souled more generous fellow than alfred in all that concerns his equals and we got on admirably with this property question without a single unbrotherly word or feeling
we undertook to work the plantation together and alfred whose outward life and capabilities had double the strength of mine became an enthusiastic planter and a wonderfully successful one
you know reverence is not my forte but two year trial satisfied me that i could not be a partner in that matter
to have a great gang of seven hundred whom i could not know personally or feel any individual interest in bought and driven housed fed worked like so many horned cattle strained up to military precision the question of how little of life commonest enjoyments would keep them in working order being a constantly recurring problem the necessity of drivers and overseers the ever necessary whip first last and
only argument the whole thing was insufferably disgusting and loathsome to me and when i thought of my mother estimate of one poor human soul it became even frightful
to this day i have no patience with the unutterable trash that some of your patronizing northerners have made up as in their zeal to apologize for our sins
tell me that any man living wants to work all his day from day dawn till dark under the constant eye of a master without the power of putting forth one irresponsible volition on the same dreary monotonous unchanging toil and all for two pairs of pantaloons and a pair of shoes a year with enough food and shelter to keep him in working order
any man who thinks that human beings can as a general thing be made about as comfortable that way as any other i wish he might try it
it all nonsense to talk to me about slave enjoying all this we all know better i buy the dog and work him with a clear conscience
i always have supposed said miss_ophelia that you all of you approved of these thing and thought them right according to scripture
alfred who is as determined a despot as ever walked does not pretend to this kind of defence no he stands high and haughty on that good old respectable ground the right of the strongest and he says and i think quite sensibly that the american planter is only doing in another form what the english aristocracy and capitalists are doing by the lower classes that is i take it appropriating them body and bone soul and spirit to their use and convenience
humbug we are not quite reduced to that yet he defends both and i think at least consistently he says that there can be no high civilization without enslavement of the masses either nominal or real
there must he says be a lower class given up to physical toil and confined to an animal nature and a higher one thereby acquires leisure and wealth for a more expanded intelligence and improvement and becomes the directing soul of the lower
so he reasons because as i said he is born an aristocrat so i dont believe because i was born a democrat
how in the world can the two thing be compared said miss_ophelia the english laborer is not sold traded parted from his family whipped
he is as much at the will of his employer as if he were sold to him the slave owner can whip his refractory slave to death the capitalist can starve him to death
as to family security it is hard to say which is the worst to have one child sold or see them starve to death at home
but it no kind of apology for slavery to prove that it isnt worse than some other bad thing
i didnt give it for one nay i ll say besides that ours is the more bold and palpable infringement of human rights actually buying a man up like a horse looking at his teeth cracking his joints and trying his paces and then paying down for him having speculators breeders trader and brokers in human body and soul sets the thing before the eye of the civilized world in a more tangible form though the thing done be after all in its nature the same that is appropriating one set of human beings to the use and improvement of another without any regard to their own
well i ve travelled in england some and i ve looked over a good many documents as to the state of their lower classes and i really think there is no denying
i never thought of the matter in this light said miss_ophelia alfred when he says that his slave are better off than a large class of the population of england
you see you must not infer from what i have told you that alfred is what is called a hard master for he isnt
he is despotic and unmerciful to insubordination he would shoot a fellow down with as little remorse as he would shoot a buck if he opposed him
when i was with him i insisted that he should do something for their instruction and to please me he did get a chaplain and used to have them catechized sunday though i believe in his heart that he thought it would do about as much good to set a chaplain over his dog and horse
and the fact is that a mind stupefied and animalized by every bad influence from the hour of birth spending the whole of every week day in unreflecting toil cannot be done much with by a few hour on sunday
the teachers of sunday schools among the manufacturing population of england and among plantation hand in our country could perhaps testify to the same result there and here
yet some striking exceptions there are among us from the fact that the negro is naturally more impressible to religious sentiment than the white
but in general he takes a sort of pride in having his slave comfortably fed and accommodated well said miss_ophelia how came you to give up your plantation life
he thought it absurd after he had reformed and altered and improved everywhere to suit my notions that i still remained unsatisfied
the fact was it was after all the thing that i hated the using these man and woman the perpetuation of all this ignorance brutality and vice just to make money for me
well we jogged on together some time till alfred saw plainly that i was no planter besides i was always interfering in the details
being myself one of the laziest of mortals i had altogether too much fellow feeling for the lazy and when poor shiftless dog put stones at the bottom of their cotton baskets to make them weigh heavier or filled their sacks with dirt with cotton at the top it seemed so exactly like what i should do if i were they i couldnt and wouldnt have them flogged for it
well of course there was an end of plantation discipline and alf and i came to about the same point that i and my respected father did year before
so he told me that i was a womanish sentimentalist and would never do for business life and advised me to take the bank stock and the new orleans family mansion and go to writing poetry and let him manage the plantation
so we parted and i came here but why didnt you free your slave well i wasnt up to that
to hold them as tools for money making i could not have them to help spend money you know didnt look quite so ugly to me
some of them were old house servant to whom i was much attached and the younger one were child to the old
all were well satisfied to be as they were he paused and walked reflectively up and down the room
there was said augustine_st_clare a time in my life when i had plans and hopes of doing something in this world more than to float and drift
i had vague indistinct yearnings to be a sort of emancipator to free my native land from this spot and stain all young man have had such fever fits i suppose some
time but then why didnt you said miss_ophelia you ought not to put your hand to the plough and look back
i suppose it was a necessary incident to wisdom in us both but some how or other instead of being actor and regenerator in society i became a piece of driftwood and have been floating and eddying about ever since
well thing didnt go with me as i expected and i got the despair of living that solomon did alfred scolds me every time we meet and he has the better of me i grant for
he really does something his life is a logical result of his opinions and mine is a contemptible non sequitur
my dear cousin can you be satisfied with such a way of spending your probation satisfied was i not just telling you i despised it
but then to come back to this point we were on this liberation business i dont think my feeling about slavery are peculiar
the land groans under it and bad as it is for the slave it is worse if anything for the master
it takes no spectacles to see that a great class of vicious improvident degraded people among us are an evil to us as well as to themselves
the capitalist and aristocrat of england cannot feel that as we do because they do not mingle with the class they degrade as we do
they are in our home they are the associates of our child and they form their mind faster than we can for they are a race that child always will cling to and assimilate with
i find many man who in their heart think of it just as i do if miss_eva now was not more angel than ordinary she would be ruined
we might as well allow the small pox to run among them and think our child would not take it as to let them be uninstructed and vicious and think our child will not be affected by that
yet our law positively and utterly forbid any efficient general educational system and they do it wisely too for just begin and thoroughly educate one generation and the whole thing would be blown sky high
if we did not give them liberty they would take it and what do you think will be the end of this said miss_ophelia
one thing is certain that there is a mustering among the masses the world over and there is a dies iræ coming on sooner or later
my mother used to tell me of a millennium that was coming when jesus_christ should reign and all man should be free and happy
i dont know the same thing is working in europe in england and in this country and she taught me when i was a boy to pray thy kingdom come
sometimes i think all this sighing and groaning and stirring among the dry bones foretells what she used to tell me was coming
augustine_st_clare sometimes i think you are not far from the kingdom said miss_ophelia laying down her knitting and looking anxiously at her cousin
thank you for your good opinion but it up and down with me up to heaven gate in theory down in earth dust in practice
but who may abide the day of his appearing but there the teabell do let go and dont say now i havent had one downright serious talk for once in my life
at table marie_st_clare alluded to the incident of prue i suppose you ll think cousin she said that we are all barbarians
i think that a barbarous thing said miss_ophelia but i dont think you are all barbarians well now said marie_st_clare
i know it impossible to get along with some of these creature they are so bad they ought not to live
i dont feel a particle of sympathy for such case if they only behave themselves it would not happen but mamma said miss_eva the poor creature was unhappy that what made her drink
fiddlestick as if that were any excuse i unhappy very often i presume she said pensively that i ve had greater trials than ever she had
it just because they are so bad there some of them that you cannot break in by any kind of severity
i remember father had a man that was so lazy he would run away just to get rid of work and lie round in the swamps stealing and doing all sort of horrid thing
that man was caught and whipped time and again and it never did him any good and the last time he crawled off though he couldnt but just go and died in the swamp
i broke a fellow in once said augustine_st_clare that all the overseers and master had tried their hand on in vain
there was no sort of reason for it for father hand were always treated kindly you said marie_st_clare well i be glad to know when you ever did anything of the sort
well he was a powerful gigantic fellow a native born african and he appeared to have the rude instinct of freedom in him to an uncommon degree
nobody could do anything with him and he was sold round from overseer to overseer till at last alfred bought him because he thought he could manage him
he was a regular african lion they called him scipio well one day he knocked down the overseer and was fairly off into the swamps
alfred was greatly exasperated but i told him that it was his own fault and laid him any wager that i could break the man and finally it was agreed that if i caught him i should have him to experiment on
i was on a visit to alf plantation for it was after we had dissolved partnership so they mustered out a party of some six or seven with guns and dog for the hunt
people you know can get up as much enthusiasm in hunting a man as a deer if it is only customary in fact i got a little excited myself though i had only put in as a sort of mediator in case he was caught
he ran and bounded like a buck and kept us well in the rear for some time but at last he got caught in an impenetrable thicket of cane then he turned to bay and i tell you he fought the dog right gallantly
he dashed them to right and left and actually killed three of them with only his naked fists when a shot from a gun brought him down and he fell wounded and bleeding almost at my foot
well the dog bayed and howled and we rode and scampered and finally we started him the poor fellow looked up at me with manhood and despair both in his eye
it was all i could do to keep them from shooting him in the flush of success but i persisted in my bargain and alfred sold him to me
well i took him in hand and in one fortnight i had him tamed down as submissive and tractable as heart could desire
i kept back the dog and the party as they came pressing up and claimed him as my prisoner what in the world did you do to him said marie_st_clare
i took him to my own room had a good bed made for him dressed his wounds and tended him myself until he got fairly on his foot again
and in process of time i had free paper made out for him and told him he might go where he liked
well it was quite a simple process and did he go said miss_ophelia no the foolish fellow tore the paper in two and absolutely refused to leave me
i never had a braver better fellow trusty and true as steel he embraced christianity afterwards and became as gentle as a child
he used to oversee my place on the lake and did it capitally too i lost him the first cholera season
for i was sick almost to death and when through the panic everybody else fled scipio worked for me like a giant and actually brought me back into life again
in fact he laid down his life for me but poor fellow he was taken right after and there was no saving him
miss_eva had come gradually nearer and nearer to her father as he told the story her small lips apart her eye wide and earnest with absorbing interest
i never felt anybody loss more as he finished she suddenly threw her arm around his neck burst into tear and sobbed convulsively
what is the matter said augustine_st_clare as the child small frame trembled and shook with the violence of her feeling
miss_eva dear child this child he added ought not to hear any of this kind of thing she nervous no papa i not nervous said miss_eva controlling herself suddenly with a strength of resolution singular in such a child
i not nervous but these thing sink into my heart what do you mean miss_eva i cant tell you papa i think a great many thoughts
perhaps some day i shall tell you well think away dear only dont cry and worry your papa said augustine_st_clare look here see
what a beautiful peach i have got for you miss_eva took it and smiled though there was still a nervous twiching about the corners of her mouth
a few moment and merry laughs were heard through the silken curtains as miss_eva and augustine_st_clare were pelting each other with roses and chasing each other among the alleys of the court
there is danger that our humble friend tom_loker be neglected amid the adventures of the higher born but if our readers will accompany us up to a little loft over the stable they may perhaps learn a little of his affairs
it was a decent room containing a bed a chair and a small rough stand where lay tom_loker bible and hymn book and where he sits at present with his slate before him intent on something that seems to cost him a great deal of anxious thought
the fact was that tom_loker home yearnings had become so strong that he had begged a sheet of writing paper of miss_eva and mustering up all his small stock of literary attainment acquired by mas george_harris instructions he conceived the bold idea of writing a letter and he was busy now on his slate getting out his first draft
tom_loker was in a good deal of trouble for the form of some of the letter he had forgotten entirely and of what he did remember he did not know exactly which to use
and while he was working and breathing very hard in his earnestness miss_eva alighted like a mrs_bird on the round of his chair behind him and peeped over his shoulder
come look at the gold fish said augustine_st_clare taking her hand and stepping on to the verandah uncle tom_loker
i trying to write to my poor old woman miss_eva and my little chil en said tom_loker drawing the back of his hand over his eye but some how i feard
what funny thing you are making there i shant make it out i wish i could help you tom_loker
so miss_eva put her golden head close to his and the two commenced a grave and anxious discussion each one equally earnest and about equally ignorant and with a deal of consulting and advising over every word the composition began as they both felt very sanguine to look quite like writing
i ve learnt to write some last year i could make all the letter but i afraid i ve forgotten yes uncle tom_loker it really begins to look beautiful said miss_eva gazing delightedly on it
how pleased your wife ll be and the poor little child it a shame you ever had to go away from them
i mean to ask papa to let you go back some time missis said that she would send down money for me as soon as they could get it together said tom_loker
george_harris he said he come for me and he gave me this yer dollar as a sign and tom_loker drew from under his clothes the precious dollar
and i wanted to send a letter you know to let em know whar i was and tell poor aunt_chloe that i was well
i spectin she will young mas o he ll certainly come then said miss_eva i so glad off cause
she felt so drefful poor soul i say tom_loker said augustine_st_clare voice coming in the door at this moment tom_loker and miss_eva both started
what here said augustine_st_clare coming up and looking at the slate it tom_loker letter i helping him to write it said miss_eva isnt it nice
i wouldnt discourage either of you said augustine_st_clare but i rather think tom_loker you better get me to write your letter for you
it very important he should write said miss_eva because his mistress is going to send down money to redeem him you know papa
augustine_st_clare thought in his heart that this was probably only one of those thing which good natured owners say to their servant to alleviate their horror of being sold without any intention of fulfilling the expectation thus excited
i ll do it when i come home from my ride he told me they told him so but he did not make any audible comment upon it only ordered tom_loker to get the horse out for a ride
tom_loker letter was written in due form for him that evening and safely lodged in the post office miss_ophelia still persevered in her labors in the housekeeping line
it was universally agreed among all the household from dinah down to the youngest urchin that miss_ophelia was decidedly curis a term by which a southern servant implies that his or her betters dont exactly suit them
the higher circle in the family to wit mr_adolph jane and miss_rosa agreed that she was no lady lady never keep working about as she
did that she had no air at all and they were surprised that she should be any relation of the st clares
even marie_st_clare declared that it was absolutely fatiguing to see cousin miss_ophelia always so busy and in fact miss_ophelia industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the complaint
she sewed and stitched away from daylight till dark with the energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency and then when the light faded and the work was folded away with one turn out came the ever ready knitting work and there she was again going on as briskly as ever
one morning while miss_ophelia was busy in some of her domestic care augustine_st_clare voice was heard calling her at the foot of the stairs
it really was a labor to see her chapter xx topsy come down here cousin i ve something to show you
i ve made a purchase for your department see here said augustine_st_clare and with the word he pulled along a little negro girl about eight or nine year of age
she was one of the blackest of her race and her round shining eye glittering as glass beads moved with quick and restless glances over everything in the room
her mouth half open with astonishment at the wonders of the new mas s parlor displayed a white and brilliant set of teeth
what is it said miss_ophelia coming down with her sewing in her hand her woolly hair was braided in sundry little tails which stuck out in every direction
the expression of her face was an odd mixture of shrewdness and cunning over which was oddly drawn like a kind of veil an expression of the most doleful gravity and solemnity
she was dressed in a single filthy ragged garment made of bagging and stood with her hand demurely folded before her
altogether there was something odd and goblin like about her appearance something as miss_ophelia afterwards said so heathenish as to inspire that good lady with utter dismay and turning to augustine_st_clare she said augustine_st_clare what in the world have you brought that thing here for
for you to educate to be sure and train in the way she should go i thought she was rather a funny specimen in the jim_crow line
here topsy he added giving a whistle as a man would to call the attention of a dog give us a song now and show us some of your dancing
the black glassy eye glittered with a kind of wicked drollery and the thing struck up in a clear shrill voice an odd negro melody to which she kept time with her hand and foot spinning round clapping her hand knocking her knees together in a wild fantastic sort of time and producing in her throat all those odd guttural sounds which distinguish the native music of her race and finally turning a summerset or two and giving a prolonged closing note as odd and unearthly as that of a steam whistle she came suddenly down on the carpet and stood with her hand folded and a most sanctimonious expression of meekness and solemnity over her face only broken by the cunning glances which she shot askance from the corners of her eye
augustine_st_clare like a mischievous fellow as he was appeared to enjoy her astonishment and addressing the child again said topsy this is your new mistress
miss_ophelia stood silent perfectly paralyzed with amazement i going to give you up to her see now that you behave yourself
yes mas said topsy with sanctimonious gravity her wicked eye twinkling as she spoke you re going to be good topsy you understand said augustine_st_clare
yes mas said topsy with another twinkle her hand still devoutly folded now augustine_st_clare what upon earth is this for said miss_ophelia
your house is so full of these little plagues now that a body cant set down their foot without treading on em
i get up in the morning and find one asleep behind the door and see one black head poking out from under the table one lying on the door mat and they are mopping and mowing and grinning between all the railings and tumbling over the kitchen floor
what on earth did you want to bring this one for for you to educate didnt i tell you you re always preaching about educating
i thought i would make you a present of a fresh caught specimen and let you try your hand on her and bring her up in the way she should go
i dont want her i am sure i have more to do with em now than i want to
that you christians all over you ll get up a society and get some poor missionary to spend all his day among just such heathen
but let me see one of you that would take one into your house with you and take the labor of their conversion on yourselves
no when it comes to that they are dirty and disagreeable and it too much care and so on augustine_st_clare you know i didnt think of it in that light said miss_ophelia evidently softening
well it might be a real missionary work said she looking rather more favorably on the child augustine_st_clare had touched the right string
but she added i really didnt see the need of buying this one there are enough now in your house to take all my time and skill
miss_ophelia conscientiousness was ever on the alert well then cousin said augustine_st_clare drawing her aside i ought to beg your pardon for my good for nothing speeches
why the fact is this concern belonged to a couple of drunken creature that keep a low restaurant that i have to pass by every day and i was tired of hearing her screaming and them beating and swearing at her
you are so good after all that there no sense in them she looked bright and funny too as if something might be made of her so
i bought her and i ll give her to you try now and give her a good orthodox new england bringing up and see what it ll make of her
well i ll do what i can said miss_ophelia and she approached her new subject very much as a person might be supposed to approach a black spider supposing them to have benevolent designs toward it
you know i havent any gift that way but i like you to try she dreadfully dirty and half naked she said
well take her down stairs and make some of them clean and clothe her up miss_ophelia carried her to the kitchen regions
dont see what mas augustine_st_clare wants of nother nigger said dinah surveying the new arrival with no friendly air
wont have her around under my foot i know pah said miss_rosa and jane with supreme disgust let her keep out of our way
what in the world mas wanted another of these low nigger for i cant see you go long no more nigger dan you be miss_rosa said dinah who felt this last remark a reflection on herself
you seem to tink yourself white folks you ant nerry one black nor white i like to be one or turrer
miss_ophelia saw that there was nobody in the camp that would undertake to oversee the cleansing and dressing of the new arrival and so she was forced to do it herself with some very ungracious and reluctant assistance from jane
in fact in this world multitudes must live and die in a state that it would be too great a shock to the nerves of their fellow mortals even to hear described
miss_ophelia had a good strong practical deal of resolution and she went through all the disgusting details with heroic thoroughness though it must be confessed with no very gracious air for endurance was the utmost to which her principles could bring her
when she saw on the back and shoulders of the child great welts and calloused spots ineffaceable marks of the system under which she had grown up thus far her heart became pitiful within her
it is not for ear polite to hear the particulars of the first toilet of a neglected abused child see there said jane pointing to the marks dont that show she a limb
we ll have fine work with her i reckon i hate these nigger young uns so disgusting i wonder that mas would buy her
the young un alluded to heard all these comments with the subdued and doleful air which seemed habitual to her only scanning with a keen and furtive glance of her flickering eye
when arrayed at last in a suit of decent and whole clothing her hair cropped short to her head miss_ophelia with some satisfaction said she looked more christian like than she did and in her own mind began to mature some plans for her instruction
the ornaments which jane wore in her ear sitting down before her she began to question her how old are you topsy
dun no missis said the image with a grin that showed all her teeth dont know how old you are
didnt anybody ever tell you who was your mother never had none said the child with another grin never had any mother
persisted topsy with another grin that looked so goblin like that if miss_ophelia had been at all nervous she might have fancied that she had got hold of some sooty gnome from the land of diablerie but miss_ophelia was not nervous but plain and business like and she said with some sternness you mustnt answer me in that way child i not playing with you
what do you mean where were you born never was born tell me where you were born and who your father and mother were
never was born reiterated the creature more emphatically never had no father nor mother nor nothing i was raised by a speculator with lots of others
old aunt sue used to take car on us the child was evidently sincere and jane breaking into a short laugh said law missis there heaps of em
speculators buys em up cheap when they little and gets em raised for market how long have you lived with your master and mistress
law missis those low negroes they cant tell they dont know anything about time said jane they dont know what a year is they dont know their own ages
dun no missis is it a year or more or less dun no missis have you ever heard anything about god topsy
the child looked bewildered but grinned as usual do you know who made you nobody as i knows on said the child with a short laugh
the idea appeared to amuse her considerably for her eye twinkled and she added i spect i grow dont think nobody never made me
do you know how to sew said miss_ophelia who thought she would turn her inquiries to something more tangible
no missis what can you do what did you do for your master and mistress fetch water and wash dishes and rub knives and wait on folks
were they good to you spect they was said the child scanning miss_ophelia cunningly miss_ophelia rose from this encouraging colloquy augustine_st_clare was leaning over the back of her chair
miss_ophelia ideas of education like all her other ideas were very set and definite and of the kind that prevailed in new england a century ago and which are still preserved in some very retired and unsophisticated part where there are no railroads
as nearly as could be expressed they could be comprised in very few word to teach them to mind when they were spoken to to teach them the catechism sewing and reading and to whip them if they told lies
and though of course in the flood of light that is now poured on education these are left far away in the rear yet it is an undisputed fact that our grandmothers raised some tolerably fair man and woman under this regime as many of us can remember and testify
at all events miss_ophelia knew of nothing else to do and therefore applied her mind to her heathen with the best diligence she could command
the child was announced and considered in the family as miss_ophelia girl and as she was looked upon with no gracious eye in the kitchen miss_ophelia resolved to confine her sphere of operation and instruction chiefly to her own chamber
with a self sacrifice which some of our readers will appreciate she resolved instead of comfortably making her own bed sweeping and dusting her own chamber which
she had hitherto done in utter scorn of all offers of help from the chambermaid of the establishment to condemn herself to the martyrdom of instructing topsy to perform these operations ah woe the day
you find virgin soil there cousin put in your own ideas you wont find many to pull up did any of our readers ever do the same they will appreciate the amount of her self sacrifice
miss_ophelia began with topsy by taking her into her chamber the first morning and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and mystery of bed making
behold then topsy washed and shorn of all the little braided tails wherein her heart had delighted arrayed in a clean gown with well starched apron standing reverently before miss_ophelia with an expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral
now topsy i going to show you just how my bed is to be made i am very particular about my bed
you must learn exactly how to do it yes ma am says topsy with a deep sigh and a face of woful earnestness
now topsy look here this is the hem of the sheet this is the right side of the sheet and this is the wrong will you remember
well now the under sheet you must bring over the bolster so and tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth so do you see
but the upper sheet said miss_ophelia must be brought down in this way and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot so the narrow hem at the foot
yes ma am said topsy as before but we will add what miss_ophelia did not see that during the time when the good lady back was turned in the zeal of her manipulations the young disciple had contrived to snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon which she had adroitly slipped into her sleeves and stood with her hand dutifully folded as before
yes ma am says topsy with another sigh yes ma am said topsy with profound attention now topsy let see you do this said miss_ophelia pulling off the clothes and seating herself
topsy with great gravity and adroitness went through the exercise completely to miss_ophelia satisfaction smoothing the sheets patting out every wrinkle and exhibiting through the whole process a gravity and seriousness with which her instructress was greatly edified
by an unlucky slip however a fluttering fragment of the ribbon hung out of one of her sleeves just as she was finishing and caught miss_ophelia attention
the ribbon was pulled out of topsy own sleeve yet was she not in the least disconcerted she only looked at it with an air of the most surprised and unconscious innocence
instantly she pounced upon it what this you naughty wicked child you ve been stealing this law why that ar miss_feely ribbon ant it
how could it a got caught in my sleeve topsy you naughty girl dont you tell me a lie you stole that ribbon
missis i declar fort i didnt never seed it till dis yer blessed minnit topsy said miss_ophelia dont you know it wicked to tell lies
i never tell no lies miss_feely said topsy with virtuous gravity it jist the truth i ve been a tellin now and ant nothing else
topsy i shall have to whip you if you tell lies so law missis if you to whip all day couldnt say no other way said topsy beginning to blubber
miss feeley must have left it on the bed and it got caught in the clothes and so got in my sleeve
i never seed dat ar it must a got caught in my sleeve miss_ophelia was so indignant at the barefaced lie that she caught the child and shook her
dont you tell me that again the shake brought the glove on to the floor from the other sleeve
there you said miss_ophelia will you tell me now you didnt steal the ribbon topsy now confessed to the gloves but still persisted in denying the ribbon
now topsy said miss_ophelia if you ll confess all about it i wont whip you this time thus adjured topsy confessed to the ribbon and gloves with woful protestations of penitence
i know you must have taken other thing since you have been in the house for i let you run about all day yesterday
well now tell me now tell me if you took anything and i shant whip you law missis i took miss_eva red thing she wars on her neck
you did you naughty child well what else i took miss_rosa yer rings them red one go bring them to me this minute both of em
law missis i cant they burnt up burnt up what a story go get em or i ll whip you topsy with loud protestations and tear and groans declared that she could not
they burnt up they was what did you burn em for said miss_ophelia cause i wicked i is
i mighty wicked any how i cant help it just at this moment miss_eva came innocently into the room with the identical coral necklace on her neck
why miss_eva where did you get your necklace said miss_ophelia get it why i ve had it on all day said miss_eva
did you have it on yesterday yes and what is funny aunty i had it on all night i forgot to take it off when i went to bed
miss_ophelia looked perfectly bewildered the more so as miss_rosa at that instant came into the room with a basket of newly ironed linen poised on her head and the coral ear drops shaking in her ear
i sure i cant tell anything what to do with such a child she said in despair what in the world did you tell me you took those thing for topsy
why missis said i must fess and i couldnt think of nothing else to fess said topsy rubbing her eye
but of course i didnt want you to confess thing you didnt do said miss_ophelia that telling a lie just as much as the other
law now is it said topsy with an air of innocent wonder la there ant any such thing as truth in that limb said miss_rosa looking indignantly at topsy
no no miss_rosa said miss_eva with an air of command which the child could assume at time you mustnt talk so miss_rosa
if i was mas augustine_st_clare i whip her till the blood run i would i let her catch it i cant bear to hear it
la sakes miss_eva you so good you dont know nothing how to get along with nigger there no way but
dont you say another word of that sort and the eye of the child flashed and her cheek deepened its color
to cut em well up i tell ye miss_rosa said miss_eva hush miss_rosa was cowed in a moment miss_eva has got the augustine_st_clare blood in her that plain
she can speak for all the world just like her papa she said as she passed out of the room miss_eva stood looking at topsy
the fair high bred child with her golden head her deep eye her spiritual noble brow and prince like movements and her black keen subtle cringing yet acute neighbor
the saxon born of ages of cultivation command education physical and moral eminence the afric born of ages of oppression submission ignorance toil and vice
there stood the two child representatives of the two extremes of society they stood the representatives of their race something perhaps of such thoughts struggled through miss_eva mind
but a child thoughts are rather dim undefined instincts and in miss_eva noble nature many such were yearning and working for which she had no power of utterance
when miss_ophelia expatiated on topsy naughty wicked conduct the child looked perplexed and sorrowful but said sweetly poor topsy why need you steal
you re going to be taken good care of now i sure i rather give you anything of mine than have you steal it
it was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life and the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild rude heart and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen round glittering eye but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual grin
the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely incredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness and topsy only thought miss_eva speech something funny and inexplicable she did not believe it
no but what was to be done with topsy miss_ophelia found the case a puzzler her rules for bringing up didnt seem to apply
she thought she would take time to think of it and by the way of gaining time and in hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark closets miss_ophelia shut topsy up in one till she had arranged her ideas further on the subject
i dont see said miss_ophelia to augustine_st_clare how i going to manage that child without whipping her
well whip her then to your heart content i ll give you full power to do what you like child always have to be whipped said miss_ophelia i never heard of bringing them up without
only i ll make one suggestion i ve seen this child whipped with a poker knocked down with the shovel or tongs whichever came handiest and seeing that she is used to that style of operation i think your whippings will have to be pretty energetic to make much impression
well certainly said augustine_st_clare do as you think best what is to be done with her then said miss_ophelia
what is to be done with a human being that can be governed only by the lash that fails it a very common state of thing down here
you have started a serious question said augustine_st_clare i wish you answer it i sure i dont know i never saw such a child as this
such child are very common among us and such man and woman too how are they to be governed said augustine_st_clare
the horrid cruelties and outrages that once and a while find their way into the paper such case as prue for example what
i sure it more than i can say said miss_ophelia or i either said augustine_st_clare do they come from
in many case it is a gradual hardening process on both side the owner growing more and more cruel as the servant more and more callous
i saw this very early when i became an owner and i resolved never to begin because i did not know when i should
whipping and abuse are like laudanum you have to double the dose as the sensibilities decline stop and i resolved at least to protect my own moral nature
the consequence is that my servant act like spoiled child but i think that better than for us both to be brutalized together
you have talked a great deal about our responsibilities in educating cousin i really wanted you to try with one child who is a specimen of thousands among us
it is your system makes such child said miss_ophelia i know it but they are made they exist and what is to be done with them
but then as it appears to be a duty i shall persevere and try and do the best i can said miss_ophelia and miss_ophelia after this did labor with a commendable degree of zeal and energy on her new subject
well i cant say i thank you for the experiment she instituted regular hour and employments for her and undertook to teach her to read and sew
she learned her letter as if by magic and was very soon able to read plain reading but the sewing was a more difficult matter
the creature was as lithe as a cat and as active as a monkey and the confinement of sewing was her abomination so she broke her needles threw them slyly out of the window or down in chinks of the walls she tangled broke and dirtied her thread or with a sly movement would throw a spool away altogether
her motions were almost as quick as those of a practised conjurer and her command of her face quite as great and though miss_ophelia could not help feeling that so many accidents could not possibly happen in succession yet she could not without a watchfulness which would leave her no time for anything else detect her
her talent for every species of drollery grimace and mimicry for dancing tumbling climbing singing whistling imitating every sound that hit her fancy seemed inexhaustible
in her play hour she invariably had every child in the establishment at her heels open mouthed with admiration and wonder not excepting miss_eva who appeared to be fascinated by her wild diablerie as a dove is sometimes charmed by a glittering serpent
in the former art the child was quick enough topsy was soon a noted character in the establishment miss_ophelia was uneasy that miss_eva should fancy topsy society so much and implored augustine_st_clare to forbid it
poh let the child alone said augustine_st_clare topsy will do her good but so depraved a child are
she cant teach her mischief she might teach it to some child but evil rolls off miss_eva mind like dew off a cabbage leaf not a drop sinks in
you not afraid she will teach her some mischief dont be too sure said miss_ophelia i know i never let a child of mine play with topsy
well your child neednt said augustine_st_clare but mine may if miss_eva could have been spoiled it would have been done year ago
it was very soon discovered that whoever cast an indignity on topsy was sure to meet with some inconvenient accident shortly after either a pair of ear rings or some cherished trinket would be missing or an article of dress would be suddenly found utterly ruined or the person would stumble accidently into a pail of hot water or a libation of dirty slop would unaccountably deluge them from above when in full gala dress and on all these occasions when investigation was made there was nobody found to stand sponsor for the indignity
topsy was cited and had up before all the domestic judicatories time and again but always sustained her examinations with most edifying innocence and gravity of appearance
nobody in the world ever doubted who did the thing but not a scrap of any direct evidence could be found to establish the suppositions and miss_ophelia was too just to feel at liberty to proceed to any length without it
topsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servant they soon found reason to alter their opinion the mischiefs done were always so nicely timed also as further to shelter the aggressor
thus the time for revenge on miss_rosa and jane the two chamber maids were always chosen in those seasons when as not unfrequently happened they were in disgrace with their mistress when any complaint from them would of course meet with no sympathy
in short topsy soon made the household understand the propriety of letting her alone and she was let alone accordingly topsy was smart and energetic in all manual operations learning everything that was taught her with surprising quickness
with a few lessons she had learned to do the proprieties of miss_ophelia chamber in a way with which even that particular lady could find no fault
mortal hand could not lay spread smoother adjust pillows more accurately sweep and dust and arrange more perfectly than topsy when she
if miss_ophelia after three or four day of careful patient supervision was so sanguine as to suppose that topsy had at last fallen into her way could do without over looking and so go off and busy herself about something else topsy would hold a perfect carnival of confusion for some one or two hour
instead of making the bed she would amuse herself with pulling off the pillowcases butting her woolly head among the pillows till it would sometimes be grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in various directions she would climb the posts and hang head downward from the tops flourish the sheets and spreads all over the apartment dress the bolster up in miss_ophelia night clothes and enact various performances with that singing and whistling and making grimaces at herself in the looking glass in short as miss_ophelia phrased it raising cain generally
on one occasion miss_ophelia found topsy with her very best scarlet india canton crape shawl wound round her head for a turban going on with her rehearsals before the glass in great style miss
chose but she didnt very often choose miss_ophelia having with carelessness most unheard of in her left the key for once in her drawer
topsy she would say when at the end of all patience what does make you act so dunno missis i spects cause i so wicked
i dont know anything what i shall do with you topsy law missis you must whip me my old missis allers whipped me
i ant used to workin unless i gets whipped why topsy i dont want to whip you you can do well
if you ve a mind to what is the reason you wont law missis i used to whippin i spects it good for me
miss_ophelia tried the recipe and topsy invariably made a terrible commotion screaming groaning and imploring though half an hour afterwards when roosted on some projection of the balcony and surrounded by a flock of admiring young uns she would express the utmost contempt of the whole affair
law miss_feely whip wouldnt kill a skeeter her whippins oughter see how old mas made the flesh fly old mas r
know how topsy always made great capital of her own sins and enormities evidently considering them as something peculiarly distinguishing
law you nigger she would say to some of her auditors does you know you all sinners well you is everybody is
white folks is sinners too miss_feely says so but i spects nigger is the biggest one but lor ye ant any on ye up to me
i so awful wicked there cant nobody do nothing with me i used to keep old missis a swarin at me half de time
i spects i the wickedest critter in the world and topsy would cut a summerset and come up brisk and shining on to a higher perch and evidently plume herself on the distinction
miss_ophelia busied herself very earnestly on sundays teaching topsy the catechism topsy had an uncommon verbal memory and committed with a fluency that greatly encouraged her instructress
what good do you expect it is going to do her said augustine_st_clare why it always has done child good
it what child always have to learn you know said miss_ophelia understand it or not said augustine_st_clare
mine hasnt come to me yet said augustine_st_clare though i ll bear testimony that you put it into me pretty thoroughly when i was a boy
o child never understand it at the time but after they are grown up it ll come to them ah you were always good at learning augustine_st_clare
i used to have great hopes of you said miss_ophelia well havent you now said augustine_st_clare i wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy augustine_st_clare
so do i that a fact cousin said augustine_st_clare well go ahead and catechize topsy may be you ll make out something yet
topsy who had stood like a black statue during this discussion with hand decently folded now at a signal from miss_ophelia went on
our first parents being left to the freedom of their own will fell from the state wherein they were created
topsy eye twinkled and she looked inquiringly what is it topsy said miss_ophelia please missis was dat ar state kintuck
what state topsy dat state dey fell out of i used to hear mas tell how we came down from kintuck
augustine_st_clare laughed you ll have to give her a meaning or she ll make one said he there seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there
well i wont disturb the exercises again on my honor and augustine_st_clare took his paper into the parlor and sat down till topsy had finished her recitations
augustine_st_clare be still said miss_ophelia how can i do anything if you will be laughing they were all very well only that now
and then she would oddly transpose some important word and persist in the mistake in spite of every effort to the contrary and augustine_st_clare after all his promises of goodness took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes calling topsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself and getting her to repeat the offending passages in spite of miss_ophelia remonstrances
how do you think i can do anything with the child if you will go on so augustine_st_clare she would say
well it is too bad i wont again but i do like to hear the droll little image stumble over those big word
but you confirm her in the wrong way what the odds one word is as good as another to her
you wanted me to bring her up right and you ought to remember she is a reasonable creature and be careful of your influence over her
in very much this way topsy training proceeded for a year or two miss_ophelia worrying herself from day to day with her as a kind of chronic plague to whose inflictions she became in time as accustomed as persons sometimes do to the neuralgia or sick headache
augustine_st_clare took the same kind of amusement in the child that a man might in the tricks of a parrot or a pointer
topsy whenever her sins brought her into disgrace in other quarters always took refuge behind his chair and augustine_st_clare in one way or other would make peace for her
from him she got many a stray picayune which she laid out in nuts and candies and distributed with careless generosity to all the child in the family for topsy to do her justice was good natured and liberal and only spiteful in self defence
she is fairly introduced into our corps de ballet and will figure from time to time in her turn with other performers
our readers may not be unwilling to glance back for a brief interval at uncle tom_loker cabin on the kentucky farm and see what has been transpiring among those whom he had left behind
it was late in the summer afternoon and the door and window of the large parlor all stood open to invite any stray breeze that might feel in a good humor to enter
mr_shelby sat in a large hall opening into the room and running through the whole length of the house to a balcony on either end
dismal so i ought but as topsy herself says i so wicked chapter xxi kentuck leisurely tipped back on one chair with his heels in another he was enjoying his after dinner cigar
mrs mr_shelby sat in the door busy about some fine sewing she seemed like one who had something on her mind which she was seeking an opportunity to introduce
do you know she said that aunt_chloe has had a letter from tom_loker ah has she tom_loker got some friend there it seems
he has been bought by a very fine family i should think said mrs mr_shelby is kindly treated and has not much to do
how is the old boy ah well i glad of it very glad said mr_shelby heartily tom_loker i suppose will get reconciled to a southern residence hardly want to come up here again
on the contrary he inquires very anxiously said mrs mr_shelby when the money for his redemption is to be raised
i sure i dont know said mr_shelby once get business running wrong there does seem to be no end to it
it like jumping from one bog to another all through a swamp borrow of one to pay another and then borrow of another to pay one and these confounded notes falling due before a man has time to smoke a cigar and turn round dunning letter and dunning messages all scamper and hurry scurry
it does seem to me my dear that something might be done to straighten matter suppose we sell off all the horse and sell one of your farms and pay up square
you are the finest woman in kentucky but still you havent sense to know that you dont understand business woman never do and never can
a list of all your debts at least and of all that is owed to you and let me try and see if i cant help you to economize
ridiculous emily but at least said mrs mr_shelby could not you give me some little insight into yours
i know somewhere about what thing are likely to be but there no trimming and squaring my affairs as aunt_chloe trims crust off her pies
and mr_shelby not knowing any other way of enforcing his ideas raised his voice a mode of arguing very convenient and convincing when a gentleman is discussing matter of business with his wife
bother dont plague me emily i cant tell exactly you dont know anything about business i tell you mrs mr_shelby ceased talking with something of a sigh
the fact was that though her husband had stated she was a woman she had a clear energetic practical mind and a force of character every way superior to that of her husband so that it would not have been so very absurd a supposition to have allowed her capable of managing as mr_shelby supposed
her heart was set on performing her promise to tom_loker and aunt_chloe and she sighed as discouragements thickened around her
dont you think we might in some way contrive to raise that money poor aunt_chloe her heart is so set on it
i not sure now but it the best way to tell aunt_chloe and let her make up her mind to it
i sorry if it is i think i was premature in promising tom_loker ll have another wife in a year or two and she had better take up with somebody else
mr_shelby i have taught my people that their marriages are as sacred as ours i never could think of giving aunt_chloe such advice
it a pity wife that you have burdened them with a morality above their condition and prospects i always thought so
well well emily i dont pretend to interfere with your religious notions only they seem extremely unfitted for people in that condition
it only the morality of the bible mr_shelby they are indeed said mrs mr_shelby and that is why from my soul i hate the whole thing
if i can get the money no other way i will take music scholars i could get enough i know and earn the money myself
i tell you my dear i cannot absolve myself from the promises i make to these helpless creature you wouldnt degrade yourself that way
emily i never could consent to it degrade would it degrade me as much as to break my faith with the helpless
well you are always heroic and transcendental said mr_shelby but i think you had better think before you undertake such a piece of quixotism
no indeed here the conversation was interrupted by the appearance of aunt_chloe at the end of the verandah
if you please missis said she well aunt_chloe what is it said her mistress rising and going to the end of the balcony
aunt_chloe had a particular fancy for calling poultry poetry an application of language in which she always persisted notwithstanding frequent corrections and advisings from the young members of the family
if missis would come and look at dis yer lot poetry la sakes she would say i cant see
mrs mr_shelby smiled as she saw a prostrate lot of chickens and ducks over which aunt_chloe stood with a very grave face of consideration
one jis good as turry poetry suthin good any how and so poetry aunt_chloe continued to call it i a thinkin whether missis would be a havin
a chicken pie dese yer really aunt_chloe i dont much care serve them any way you like aunt_chloe stood handling them over abstractedly it was quite evident that the chickens were not what she was thinking of
at last with the short laugh with which her tribe often introduce a doubtful proposal she said law me missis what should mas and missis be a troublin theirselves bout de money and not a usin
i dont understand you aunt_chloe said mrs mr_shelby nothing doubting from her knowledge of aunt_chloe manner that she had heard every word of the conversation that had passed between her and her husband

law missis she wont take no lookin arter louisville is a good way off law sakes

yes you may go and your wages shall every cent of them be laid aside for your husband redemption as when a bright sunbeam turns a dark cloud to silver so aunt_chloe dark face brightened immediately it really shone

the grass withereth the flower fadeth life passes with us all a day at a time so it passed with our friend tom_loker till two year were gone
though parted from all his soul held dear and though often yearning for what lay beyond still was he never positively and consciously miserable for so well is the harp of human feeling strung that nothing but a crash that breaks every string can wholly mar its harmony and on looking back to seasons which in review appear to us as those of deprivation and trial we can remember that each hour as it glided brought its diversions and alleviations so that though not happy wholly we were not either wholly miserable
tom_loker read in his only literary cabinet of one who had learned in whatsoever state he was therewith to be content
it seemed to him good and reasonable doctrine and accorded well with the settled and thoughtful habit which he had acquired from the reading of that same book
his letter homeward as we related in the last chapter was in due time answered by master george_harris in a good round school boy hand that tom_loker said might be read most acrost the room
it contained various refreshing items of home intelligence with which our reader is fully acquainted stated how aunt_chloe had been hired out to a confectioner in louisville where her skill in the pastry line was gaining wonderful sums of money all of which tom_loker was informed was to be laid up to go to make up the sum of his redemption money mose and pete were thriving and the baby was trotting all about the house under the care of sally and the family generally
tom_loker cabin was shut up for the present but george_harris expatiated brilliantly on ornaments and additions to be made to it when tom_loker came back
the rest of this letter gave a list of george_harris school studies each one headed by a flourishing capital and also told the names of four new colts that appeared on the premises since tom_loker left and stated in the same connection that father and mother were well
the style of the letter was decidedly concise and terse but tom_loker thought it the most wonderful specimen of composition that had appeared in modern time
he was never tired of looking at it and even held a council with miss_eva on the expediency of getting it framed to hang up in his room
nothing but the difficulty of arranging it so that both side of the page would show at once stood in the way of this undertaking
chapter xxii the friendship between tom_loker and miss_eva had grown with the child growth it would be hard to say what place she held in the soft impressible heart of her faithful attendant
he gazed on her as the italian sailor gazes on his image of the child lord_jesus with a mixture of reverence and tenderness and to humor her graceful fancies and meet those thousand simple wants which invest childhood like a many colored rainbow was tom_loker chief delight
in the market at morning his eye were always on the flower stalls for rare bouquets for her and the choicest peach or orange was slipped into his pocket to give to her when he came back and the sight that pleased him most was her sunny head looking out the gate for his distant approach and her childish questions well uncle tom_loker what have you got for me today
he loved her as something frail and earthly yet almost worshipped her as something heavenly and divine nor was miss_eva less zealous in kind offices in return
though a child she was a beautiful reader a fine musical ear a quick poetic fancy and an instinctive sympathy with what grand and noble made her such a reader of the bible as tom_loker had never before heard
at first she read to please her humble friend but soon her own earnest nature threw out its tendrils and wound itself around the majestic book and miss_eva loved it because it woke in her strange yearnings and strong dim emotions such as impassioned imaginative child love to feel
the part that pleased her most were the revelations and the prophecies part whose dim and wondrous imagery and fervent language impressed her the more that she questioned vainly of their meaning and
all that they knew was that they spoke of a glory to be revealed a wondrous something yet to come wherein their soul rejoiced yet knew not why and though it be not so in the physical yet in moral science that which cannot be understood is not always profitless
she and her simple friend the old child and the young one felt just alike about it for the soul awakes a trembling stranger between two dim eternities the eternal past the eternal future
the light shines only on a small space around her therefore she needs must yearn towards the unknown and the voice and shadowy movings which come to her from out the cloudy pillar of inspiration have each one echoes and answers in her own expecting nature
its mystic imagery are so many talismans and gems inscribed with unknown hieroglyphics she folds them in her bosom and expects to read them when she passes beyond the veil
at this time in our story the whole augustine_st_clare establishment is for the time being removed to their villa on lake pontchartrain
the heats of summer had driven all who were able to leave the sultry and unhealthy city to seek the shores of the lake and its cool sea breezes
augustine_st_clare villa was an east indian cottage surrounded by light verandah of bamboo work and opening on all side into gardens and pleasure grounds
the common sitting room opened on to a large garden fragrant with every picturesque plant and flower of the tropics where winding paths ran down to the very shores of the lake whose silvery sheet of water lay there rising and falling in the sunbeams a picture never for an hour the same yet every hour more beautiful
it is now one of those intensely golden sunsets which kindles the whole horizon into one blaze of glory and makes the water another sky
the lake lay in rosy or golden streaks save where white winged vessels glided hither and thither like so many spirit and little golden stars twinkled through the glow and looked down at themselves as they trembled in the water
tom_loker and miss_eva were seated on a little mossy seat in an arbor at the foot of the garden it was sunday evening and miss_eva bible lay open on her knee
she read and i saw a sea of glass mingled with fire tom_loker said miss_eva suddenly stopping and pointing to the lake theret is
said the child pointing to the glassy water which as it rose and fell reflected the golden glow of the sky
what miss_eva dont you see there there a sea of glass mingled with fire true enough miss_eva said tom_loker and tom_loker sang
had i the wings of the morning i fly away to canaan shore bright angels should convey me home to the new jerusalem
where do you suppose new jerusalem is uncle tom_loker said miss_eva up in the clouds miss_eva
then i think i see it said miss_eva look in those clouds they look like great gates of pearl and you can see beyond them far far off it all gold
tom_loker sung the word of a well known methodist hymn i see a band of spirit bright that taste the glories there they all are robed in spotless white and conquering palms they bear
tom_loker sing about spirit bright uncle tom_loker i ve seen them said miss_eva tom_loker had no doubt of it at all it did not surprise him in the least
they come to me sometimes in my sleep those spirit and miss_eva eye grew dreamy and she hummed in a low voice they are all robed in spotless white and conquering palms they bear
if miss_eva had told him she had been to heaven he would have thought it entirely probable uncle tom_loker said miss_eva i going there
the child rose and pointed her little hand to the sky the glow of evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly radiance and her eye were bent earnestly on the skies
where miss_eva i going there she said to the spirit bright tom_loker i going before long
the faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust and tom_loker thought how often he had noticed within six months that miss_eva little hand had grown thinner and her skin more transparent and her breath shorter and how when she ran or played in the garden as she once could for hour she became soon so tired and languid
he had heard miss_ophelia speak often of a cough that all her medicaments could not cure and even now that fervent cheek and little hand were burning with hectic fever and yet the thought that miss_eva word suggested had never come to him till now
yes there have been but their names are always on grave stones and their sweet smiles their heavenly eye their singular word and way are among the buried treasures of yearning heart
in how many family do you hear the legend that all the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to the peculiar charms of one who is not
it is as if heaven had an especial band of angels whose office it was to sojourn for a season here and endear to them the wayward human heart that they might bear it upward with them in their homeward flight
when you see that deep spiritual light in the eye when the little soul reveals itself in word sweeter and wiser than the ordinary word of child hope not to retain that child for the seal of heaven is on it and the light of immortality looks out from its eye
has there ever been a child like miss_eva even so beloved miss_eva fair star of thy dwelling thou art passing away but they that love thee dearest know it not
the colloquy between tom_loker and miss_eva was interrupted by a hasty call from miss_ophelia miss_eva eva why child the dew is falling you mustnt be out there
she was from new england and knew well the first guileful footsteps of that soft insidious disease which sweeps away so many of the fairest and loveliest and before one fibre of life seems broken seals them irrevocably for death
she had noted the slight dry cough the daily brightening cheek nor could the lustre of the eye and the airy buoyancy born of fever deceive her
she tried to communicate her fears to augustine_st_clare but he threw back her suggestions with a restless petulance unlike his usual careless good humor
miss_eva and tom_loker hastened in miss_ophelia was old and skilled in the tactics of nursing dont be croaking cousin i hate it
he would say dont you see that the child is only growing child always lose strength when they grow fast
but she has that cough nonsense of that cough it is not anything she has taken a little cold perhaps
well that was just the way eliza_harris jane was taken and ellen and maria sanders stop these hobgoblin nurse legends
you old hand got so wise that a child cannot cough or sneeze but you see desperation and ruin at hand
only take care of the child keep her from the night air and dont let her play too hard and she ll do well enough
he watched miss_eva feverishly day by day as might be told by the frequency with which he repeated over that the child was
so augustine_st_clare said but he grew nervous and restless quite well that there wasnt anything in that cough it was only some little stomach affection such as child often had
but he kept by her more than before took her oftener to ride with him brought home every few day some receipt or strengthening mixture not he said that the child needed it but then it would not do her any harm
if it must be told the thing that struck a deeper pang to his heart than anything else was the daily increasing maturity of the child mind and feeling
while still retaining all a child fanciful graces yet she often dropped unconsciously word of such a reach of thought and strange unworldly wisdom that they seemed to be an inspiration
at such time augustine_st_clare would feel a sudden thrill and clasp her in his arm as if that fond clasp could save her and his heart rose up with wild determination to keep her never to let her go
impulsively generous she had always been but there was a touching and womanly thoughtfulness about her now that every one noticed
she still loved to play with topsy and the various colored child but she now seemed rather a spectator than an actor of their plays and she would sit for half an hour at a time laughing at the odd tricks of topsy and then a shadow would seem to pass across her face her eye grew misty and her thoughts were afar
the child whole heart and soul seemed absorbed in work of love and kindness mamma she said suddenly to her mother one day why dont we teach our servant to read
what a question child people never do why dont they said miss_eva because it is no use for them to read
it dont help them to work any better and they are not made for anything else but they ought to read the bible mamma to learn god will
they can get that read to them all they need it seems to me mamma the bible is for every one to read themselves
they need it a great many time when there is nobody to read it miss_eva you are an odd child said her mother
miss_ophelia has taught topsy to read continued miss_eva yes and you see how much good it does topsy is the worst creature i ever saw
here poor mammy said miss_eva she does love the bible so much and wishes so she could read and what will she do when i cant read to her
marie_st_clare was busy turning over the contents of a drawer as she answered well of course by and by miss_eva you will have other thing to think of besides reading the bible round to servant
not but that is very proper i ve done it myself when i had health but when you come to be dressing and going into company you wont have time
see here she added these jewels i going to give you when you come out i wore them to my first ball
i can tell you miss_eva i made a sensation miss_eva took the jewel case and lifted from it a diamond necklace
her large thoughtful eye rested on them but it was plain her thoughts were elsewhere how sober you look child said marie_st_clare
are these worth a great deal of money mamma to be sure they are father sent to france for them
they are worth a small fortune i wish i had them said miss_eva to do what i pleased with what would you do with them
i sell them and buy a place in the free state and take all our people there and hire teachers to teach them to read and write
miss_eva was cut short by her mother laughing set up a boarding school wouldnt you teach them to play on the piano and paint on velvet
i teach them to read their own bible and write their own letter and read letter that are written to them said miss_eva steadily
i know mamma it does come very hard on them that they cant do these thing tom_loker feels it mammy does a great many of them do
i think it wrong come come miss_eva you are only a child you dont know anything about these thing said marie_st_clare besides your talking makes my head ache
marie_st_clare always had a headache on hand for any conversation that did not exactly suit her miss_eva stole away but after that she assiduously gave mammy reading lessons
about this time augustine_st_clare brother alfred with his eldest son a boy of twelve spent a day or two with the family at the lake
nature instead of instituting resemblances between them had made them opposites on every point yet a mysterious tie seemed to unite them in a closer friendship than ordinary
chapter xxiii henrique no sight could be more singular and beautiful than that of these twin brothers they used to saunter arm in arm up and down the alleys and walks of the garden
augustine_st_clare with his blue eye and golden hair his ethereally flexible form and vivacious features and alfred dark eyed with haughty roman profile firmly knit limbs and decided bearing
they were always abusing each other opinions and practices and yet never a whit the less absorbed in each other society in fact the very contrariety seemed to unite them like the attraction between opposite poles of the magnet
henrique the eldest son of alfred was a noble dark eyed princely boy full of vivacity and spirit and from the first moment of introduction seemed to be perfectly fascinated by the spirituelle graces of his cousin evangeline
it was easy as a cradle and as gentle as its little mistress and this pony was now brought up to the back verandah by tom_loker while a little mulatto boy of about thirteen led along a small black arabian which had just been imported at a great expense for henrique
henrique had a boy pride in his new possession and as he advanced and took the reins out of the hand of his little groom he looked carefully over him and his brow darkened
miss_eva had a little pet pony of a snowy whiteness what this dodo you little lazy dog you havent rubbed my horse down this morning
yes mas said dodo submissively he got that dust on his own self you rascal shut your mouth said henrique violently raising his riding whip
the boy was a handsome bright eyed mulatto of just henrique size and his curling hair hung round a high bold forehead
he had white blood in his veins as could be seen by the quick flush in his cheek and the sparkle of his eye as he eagerly tried to speak
henrique struck him across the face with his riding whip and seizing one of his arm forced him on to his knees and beat him till he was out of breath
how dare you speak mas henrique he began there you impudent dog now will you learn not to answer back when i speak to you
young mas said tom_loker i specs what he was gwine to say was that the horse would roll when he was bringing him up from the stable he so full of spirit that
take the horse back and clean him properly i ll teach you your place the way he got that dirt on him
you hold your tongue till you re asked to speak said henrique turning on his heel and walking up the steps to speak to miss_eva who stood in her riding dress
i looked to his cleaning dear cousin i sorry this stupid fellow has kept you waiting he said
let sit down here on this seat till they come what the matter cousin you look sober how could you be so cruel and wicked to poor dodo
asked miss_eva cruel wicked said the boy with unaffected surprise what do you mean dear miss_eva i dont want you to call me dear miss_eva when you do so said miss_eva
dear cousin you dont know dodo it the only way to manage him he so full of lies and excuses
the only way is to put him down at once not let him open his mouth that the way papa manages
but uncle tom_loker said it was an accident and he never tells what isnt true he an uncommon old nigger then said henrique
dodo will lie as fast as he can speak you frighten him into deceiving if you treat him so
why miss_eva you ve really taken such a fancy to dodo that i shall be jealous but you beat him and he didnt deserve it
a few cuts never come amiss with dodo he a regular spirit i can tell you but i wont beat him again before you if it troubles you
well it may go for some time when he does and dont get it miss_eva was not satisfied but found it in vain to try to make her handsome cousin understand her feeling
dodo soon appeared with the horse well dodo you ve done pretty well this time said his young master with a more gracious air
come now and hold miss_eva horse while i put her on to the saddle dodo came and stood by miss_eva pony
henrique who valued himself on his gentlemanly adroitness in all matter of gallantry soon had his fair cousin in the saddle and gathering the reins placed them in her hand
but miss_eva bent to the other side of the horse where dodo was standing and said as he relinquished the reins that a good boy dodo thank you
dodo looked up in amazement into the sweet young face the blood rushed to his cheeks and the tear to his eye
his face was troubled his eye looked as if he had been crying here dodo said his master imperiously dodo sprang and held the horse while his master mounted
there a picayune for you to buy candy with dodo said henrique go get some and henrique cantered down the walk after miss_eva
dodo stood looking after the two child one had given him money and one had given him what he wanted far more a kind word kindly spoken
his master had bought him at a slave warehouse for his handsome face to be a match to the handsome pony and he was now getting his breaking in at the hand of his young master
dodo had been only a few months away from his mother the scene of the beating had been witnessed by the two brothers augustine_st_clare from another part of the garden
augustine_st_clare cheek flushed but he only observed with his usual sarcastic carelessness i suppose that what we may call republican education alfred
henrique is a devil of a fellow when his blood up said alfred carelessly i suppose you consider this an instructive practice for him said augustine_st_clare drily
i couldnt help it if i didnt henrique is a regular little tempest his mother and i have given him up long ago
and this by way of teaching henrique the first verse of a republican catechism all man are born free and equal
but then that dodo is a perfect sprite no amount of whipping can hurt him poh said alfred one of tom_loker jefferson pieces of french sentiment and humbug
it perfectly ridiculous to have that going the rounds among us to this day i think it is said augustine_st_clare significantly
because said alfred we can see plainly enough that all man are not born free nor born equal they are born anything else
for my part i think half this republican talk sheer humbug it is the educated the intelligent the wealthy the refined who ought to have equal rights and not the canaille
of course they must be kept down consistently steadily as i should said alfred setting his foot hard down as if he were standing on somebody
if you can keep the canaille of that opinion said augustine_st_clare they took their turn once in france it makes a terrible slip when they get up said augustine_st_clare in st domingo for instance
we must set our face against all this educating elevating talk that is getting about now the lower class must not be educated
poh said alfred we ll take care of that in this country that is past praying for said augustine_st_clare educated they will be and we have only to say how
we are breaking all humanizing ties and making them brute beasts and if they get the upper hand such we shall find them
that right said augustine_st_clare put on the steam fasten down the escape valve and sit on it and see where you ll land
our system is educating them in barbarism and brutality they shall never get the upper hand said alfred
well said alfred we will see i not afraid to sit on the escape valve as long as the boilers are strong and the machinery work well
think so now and some pleasant morning you may all be caught up to meet each other in the air when the boilers burst
the nobles in louis xvi time thought just so and austria and pius ix dies declarabit said alfred laughing
i tell you said augustine_st_clare if there is anything that is revealed with the strength of a divine law in our time it is that the masses are to rise and the under class become the upper one
that one of your red republican humbugs augustine_st_clare why didnt you ever take to the stump you make a famous stump orator
greasy or not greasy they will govern you when their time comes said augustine_st_clare and they will be just such rulers as you make them
the french noblesse chose to have the people sans culottes and they had sans culotte governors to their heart content
well i hope i shall be dead before this millennium of your greasy masses comes on the people of hayti come augustine_st_clare
as if we hadnt had enough of that abominable contemptible hayti the haytiens were not anglo saxons if they had been there would have been another story
in august as a consequence of the french revolution the black slave and mulattoes on haiti rose in revolt against the whites and in the period of turmoil that followed enormous cruelties were practised by both side
the anglo saxon is the dominant race of the world and is to be so the emperor dessalines come to power in massacred all the whites on the island
haitian bloodshed became an argument to show the barbarous nature of the negro a doctrine wendell phillips sought to combat in his celebrated lecture on toussaint ouverture
there are plenty among them who have only enough of the african to give a sort of tropical warmth and fervor to our calculating firmness and foresight
well there is a pretty fair infusion of anglo saxon blood among our slave now said augustine_st_clare if ever the san domingo hour comes anglo saxon blood will lead on the day
sons of white father with all our haughty feeling burning in their veins will not always be bought and sold and traded
well said augustine_st_clare there goes an old saying to this effect as it was in the day of noah so shall it be they
they will rise and raise with them their mother race stuff nonsense ate they drank they planted they builded and knew not till the flood came and took them
on the whole augustine_st_clare i think your talents might do for a circuit rider said alfred laughing never you fear for us possession is our nine points
we ve got the power this subject race said he stamping firmly is down and shall stay down we have energy enough to manage our own powder
sons trained like your henrique will be grand guardians of your powder magazines said augustine_st_clare so cool and self possessed the proverb says they that cannot govern themselves cannot govern others
there is a trouble there said alfred thoughtfully there no doubt that our system is a difficult one to train child under
it gives too free scope to the passions altogether which in our climate are hot enough i find trouble with henrique
i believe i shall send him north for his education where obedience is more fashionable and where he will associate more with equals and less with dependents
since training child is the staple work of the human race said augustine_st_clare i should think it something of a consideration that our system does not work well there
the boy is generous and warm hearted but a perfect fire cracker when excited it does not for some thing said alfred for others again it does
it makes boy manly and courageous and the very vices of an abject race tend to strengthen in them the opposite virtues
i think henrique now has a keener sense of the beauty of truth from seeing lying and deception the universal badge of slavery
a christian like view of the subject certainly said augustine_st_clare it true christian like or not and is about as christian like as most other thing in the world said alfred
that may be said augustine_st_clare well there no use in talking augustine_st_clare i believe we ve been round and round this old track five hundred time more or less
the two brothers ran up the verandah steps and were soon seated at a light bamboo stand with the backgammon board between them
as they were setting their man alfred said i tell you augustine_st_clare if i thought as you do i should do something
what do you say to a game of backgammon i dare say you would you are one of the doing sort but what
you might as well set mount ætna on them flat and tell them to stand up under it as tell me to elevate my servant under all the superincumbent mass of society upon them
why elevate your own servant for a specimen said alfred with a half scornful smile one man can do nothing against the whole action of a community
education to do anything must be a state education or there must be enough agreed in it to make a current
you take the first throw said alfred and the brothers were soon lost in the game and heard no more till the scraping of horse foot was heard under the verandah
there come the child said augustine_st_clare rising look here alf did you ever see anything so beautiful and in truth it was a beautiful sight
henrique with his bold brow and dark glossy curls and glowing cheek was laughing gayly as he bent towards his fair cousin as they came on
exercise had given a brilliant hue to her cheeks and heightened the effect of her singularly transparent skin and golden hair
she was dressed in a blue riding dress with a cap of the same color good heavens what perfectly dazzling beauty said alfred
she will too truly god knows i afraid so said augustine_st_clare in a tone of sudden bitterness as he hurried down to take her off her horse
i tell you auguste wont she make some heart ache one of these day miss_eva darling you re not much tired
he said as he clasped her in his arm no papa said the child but her short hard breathing alarmed her father
how could you ride so fast dear you know it bad for you i felt so well papa and liked it so much
i forgot augustine_st_clare carried her in his arm into the parlor and laid her on the sofa
henrique you must be careful of miss_eva said he you mustnt ride fast with her i ll take her under my care said henrique seating himself by the sofa and taking miss_eva hand
do you know miss_eva i sorry papa is only going to stay two day here and then i shant see you again for ever so long
miss_eva soon found herself much better her father and uncle resumed their game and the child were left together if i stay with you i try to be good and not be cross to dodo and so on
i dont mean to treat dodo ill but you know i ve got such a quick temper i not really bad to him though
i give him a picayune now and then and you see he dresses well i think on the whole dodo pretty well off
would you think you were well off if there were not one creature in the world near you to love you
and you have taken dodo away from all the friend he ever had and now he has not a creature to love him nobody can be good that way
i well of course not well i cant help it as i know of i cant get his mother and i cant love him myself nor anybody else as i know of
why cant you said miss_eva love dodo why miss_eva you wouldnt have me i may like him well enough but you dont love your servant
i do indeed how odd dont the bible say we must love everybody the bible to be sure it says a great many such thing but then nobody ever thinks of doing them you
know miss_eva nobody does miss_eva did not speak her eye were fixed and thoughtful for a few moment at any rate she said dear cousin do love poor dodo and be kind to him for my sake
i could love anything for your sake dear cousin for i really think you are the loveliest creature that i ever saw
miss_eva received it with perfect simplicity without even a change of feature merely saying i glad you feel so dear henrique
and henrique spoke with an earnestness that flushed his handsome face i hope you will remember the dinner bell put an end to the interview
two day after this alfred augustine_st_clare and augustine_st_clare parted and miss_eva who had been stimulated by the society of her young cousin to exertions beyond her strength began to fail rapidly
augustine_st_clare was at last willing to call in medical advice a thing from which he had always shrunk because it was the admission of an unwelcome truth
but for a day or two miss_eva was so unwell as to be confined to the house and the doctor was called
marie_st_clare augustine_st_clare had taken no notice of the child gradually decaying health and strength because she was completely absorbed in studying out two or three new form of disease to which she believed she herself was a victim
it was the first principle of marie_st_clare belief that nobody ever was or could be so great a sufferer as herself and therefore she always repelled quite indignantly any suggestion that any one around her could be sick
she was always sure in such a case that it was nothing but laziness or want of energy and that if they had had the suffering she had they would soon know the difference
chapter xxiv foreshadowings miss_ophelia had several time tried to awaken her maternal fears about miss_eva but to no avail
i dont see as anything ails the child she would say she runs about and plays but she has a cough
cough you dont need to tell me about a cough i ve always been subject to a cough all my day
when i was of miss_eva age they thought i was in a consumption night after night mammy used to sit up with me
o miss_eva cough is not anything but she gets weak and is short breathed law i ve had that year and year it only a nervous affection
but she sweats so night well i have these ten year very often night after night my clothes will be wringing wet
there wont be a dry thread in my night clothes and the sheets will be so that mammy has to hang them up to dry
but now that miss_eva was fairly and visibly prostrated and a doctor called marie_st_clare all on a sudden took a new turn
miss_eva doesnt sweat anything like that miss_ophelia shut her mouth for a season she knew it she said she always felt it that she was destined to be the most miserable of mother
eye and marie_st_clare routed up mammy night and rumpussed and scolded with more energy than ever all day on the strength of this new misery
here she was with her wretched health and her only darling child going down to the grave before her my dear marie_st_clare dont talk so said augustine_st_clare
you ought not to give up the case so at once you have not a mother feeling augustine_st_clare
you never could understand me you dont now but dont talk so as if it were a gone case i cant take it as indifferently as you can augustine_st_clare
if you dont feel when your only child is in this alarming state i do it a blow too much for me with all i was bearing before
it true said augustine_st_clare that miss_eva is very delicate that i always knew and that she has grown so rapidly as to exhaust her strength and that her situation is critical
but just now she is only prostrated by the heat of the weather and by the excitement of her cousin visit and the exertions she made
well of course if you can look on the bright side pray do it a mercy if people havent sensitive feeling in this world
the physician says there is room for hope i am sure i wish i didnt feel as i do it only makes me completely wretched
and the rest of them had good reason to breathe the same prayer for marie_st_clare paraded her new misery as the reason and apology for all sort of inflictions on every one about her
every word that was spoken by anybody everything that was done or was not done everywhere was only a new proof that she was surrounded by hard hearted insensible beings who were unmindful of her peculiar sorrows
poor miss_eva heard some of these speeches and nearly cried her little eye out in pity for her mamma and in sorrow that she should make her so much distress
in a week or two there was a great improvement of symptoms one of those deceitful lulls by which her inexorable disease so often beguiles the anxious heart even on the verge of the grave
miss_eva step was again in the garden in the balconies she played and laughed again and her father in a transport declared that they should soon have her as hearty as anybody
i wish i could be as easy as the rest of you miss_ophelia and the physician alone felt no encouragement from this illusive truce
there was one other heart too that felt the same certainty and that was the little heart of miss_eva what is it that sometimes speaks in the soul so calmly so clearly that its earthly time is short
be it what it may it rested in the heart of miss_eva a calm sweet prophetic certainty that heaven was near calm as the light of sunset sweet as the bright stillness of autumn there her little heart reposed only troubled by sorrow for those who loved her so dearly
for the child though nursed so tenderly and though life was unfolding before her with every brightness that love and wealth could give had no regret for herself in dying
in that book which she and her simple old friend had read so much together she had seen and taken to her young heart the image of one who loved the little child and as she gazed and mused he had ceased to be an image and a picture of the distant past and come to be a living all surrounding reality
his love enfolded her childish heart with more than mortal tenderness and it was to him she said she was going and to his home
is it the secret instinct of decaying nature or the soul impulsive throb as immortality draws on but her heart yearned with sad tenderness for all that she was to leave behind
her father most for miss_eva though she never distinctly thought so had an instinctive perception that she was more in his heart than any other
she loved her mother because she was so loving a creature and all the selfishness that she had seen in her only saddened and perplexed her for she had a child implicit trust that her mother could not do wrong
there was something about her that miss_eva never could make out and she always smoothed it over with thinking that after all it was mamma and she loved her very dearly indeed
child do not usually generalize but miss_eva was an uncommonly mature child and the thing that she had witnessed of the evils of the system under which they were living had fallen one by one into the depths of her thoughtful pondering heart
she had vague longings to do something for them to bless and save not only them but all in their condition longings that contrasted sadly with the feebleness of her little frame
uncle tom_loker she said one day when she was reading to her friend i can understand why lord_jesus wanted to die for us
she felt too for those fond faithful servant to whom she was as daylight and sunshine why miss_eva
i cant tell you but when i saw those poor creature on the boat you know when you came up and i some had lost their mother and some their husband and some mother cried for their little child and when i heard about poor prue oh wasnt that dreadful and a great many other time i ve felt that i would be glad to die if my dying could stop all this misery
because i ve felt so too what is it miss_eva i dont understand i would die for them tom_loker if i could said the child earnestly laying her little thin hand on his
tom_loker looked at the child with awe and when she hearing her father voice glided away he wiped his eye many time as he looked after her
it jest no use tryin to keep miss_eva here he said to mammy whom he met a moment after
she got the lord mark in her forehead ah yes yes said mammy raising her hand i ve allers said so
she wasnt never like a child that to live there was allers something deep in her eye i ve told missis so many the time it a comin true we
it was late in the afternoon and the rays of the sun formed a kind of glory behind her as she came forward in her white dress with her golden hair and glowing cheeks her eye unnaturally bright with the slow fever that burned in her veins
augustine_st_clare had called her to show a statuette that he had been buying for her but her appearance as she came on impressed him suddenly and painfully
all sees it dear little blessed lamb miss_eva came tripping up the verandah steps to her father there is a kind of beauty so intense yet so fragile that we cannot bear to look at it
her father folded her suddenly in his arm and almost forgot what he was going to tell her miss_eva dear you are better now a day are
you not papa said miss_eva with sudden firmness i ve had thing i wanted to say to you a great while i want to say them now before i get weaker
she laid her head on his bosom and said it all no use papa to keep it to myself any longer
augustine_st_clare trembled as miss_eva seated herself in his lap the time is coming that i am going to leave you
o now my dear little miss_eva said augustine_st_clare trembling as he spoke but speaking cheerfully you ve got nervous and low spirited you mustnt indulge such gloomy thoughts
i am going and never to come back and miss_eva sobbed see here i ve bought a statuette for you no papa said miss_eva putting it gently away dont deceive yourself i am not any better i know it perfectly well and
i am going before long i am not nervous i am not low spirited if it were not for you papa and my friend i should be perfectly happy
i want to go i long to go why dear child what has made your poor little heart so sad you have had everything to make you happy that could be given you
there are a great many thing here that make me sad that seem dreadful to me i had rather be there but i dont want to leave you it
i had rather be in heaven though only for my friend sake i would be willing to live almost breaks my heart
what makes you sad and seems dreadful miss_eva thing that are done and done all the time i feel sad for our poor people they love me dearly and they are all good and kind to me
i wish papa they were all free why miss_eva child dont you think they are well enough off now
but papa if anything should happen to you what would become of them there are very few man like you papa
uncle alfred isnt like you and mamma isnt and then think of poor old prue owners what horrid thing people do and can do and miss_eva shuddered
my dear child you are too sensitive i sorry i ever let you hear such stories that what troubles me papa
you want me to live so happy and never to have any pain never suffer anything not even hear a sad story when other poor creature have nothing but pain and sorrow all their life it seems selfish
i ought to know such thing i ought to feel about them such thing always sunk into my heart they went down deep i ve thought and thought about them
there no doubt that this way is a very bad one a great many people think so i do myself i heartily wish that there were not a slave in the land but then i dont know what is to be done about it
papa you are such a good man and so noble and kind and you always have a way of saying thing that is so pleasant couldnt you go all round and try to persuade people to do right about this
papa isnt there any way to have all slave made free that a difficult question dearest when i am dead papa then you will think of me and do it for my sake
i would do it if i could when you are dead miss_eva said augustine_st_clare passionately child dont talk to me so
you are all i have on earth poor old prue child was all that she had and yet she had to hear it crying and she couldnt help it
papa these poor creature love their child as much as you do me do something for them there poor mammy love her child i ve seen her cry when she talked about them
there there darling said augustine_st_clare soothingly only dont distress yourself dont talk of dying and i will do anything you wish
and promise me dear father that tom_loker shall have his freedom as soon as she stopped and said in a hesitating tone i am gone
and tom_loker love his child and it dreadful papa that such thing are happening all the time yes dear i will do anything in the world anything you could ask me to
dear papa said the child laying her burning cheek against his how i wish we could go together where dearest said augustine_st_clare
to our saviour home it so sweet and peaceful there it is all so loving there the child spoke unconsciously as of a place where she had often been
dont you want to go papa she said augustine_st_clare drew her closer to him but was silent
you will come to me said the child speaking in a voice of calm certainty which she often used unconsciously
the shadows of the solemn evening closed round them deeper and deeper as augustine_st_clare sat silently holding the little frail form to his bosom
he saw no more the deep eye but the voice came over him as a spirit voice and as in a sort of judgment vision his whole past life rose in a moment before his eye his mother prayers and hymns his own early yearnings and aspirings for good and between them and this hour year of worldliness and scepticism and what man calls respectable living
i shall come after you i shall not forget you we can think much very much in a moment
augustine_st_clare saw and felt many thing but spoke nothing and as it grew darker he took his child to her bed room and when she was prepared for rest he sent away the attendants and rocked her in his arm and sung to her till she was asleep
chapter xxv the little evangelist it was sunday afternoon augustine_st_clare was stretched on a bamboo lounge in the verandah solacing himself with a cigar
marie_st_clare lay reclined on a sofa opposite the window opening on the verandah closely secluded under an awning of transparent gauze from the outrages of the mosquitos and languidly holding in her hand an elegantly bound prayer book
she was holding it because it was sunday and she imagined she had been reading it though in fact she had been only taking a succession of short naps with it open in her hand
miss_ophelia who after some rummaging had hunted up a small methodist meeting within riding distance had gone out with tom_loker as driver to attend it and miss_eva had accompanied them
i say augustine_st_clare said marie_st_clare after dozing a while i must send to the city after my old doctor posey i sure i ve got the complaint of the heart
well why need you send for him this doctor that attends miss_eva seems skilful i would not trust him in a critical case said marie_st_clare
and i think i may say mine is becoming so i ve been thinking of it these two or three night past i have such distressing pains and such strange feeling
marie_st_clare you are blue i dont believe it heart complaint i dare say you dont said marie_st_clare i was prepared to expect that
you can be alarmed enough if miss_eva coughs or has the least thing the matter with her but you never think of me
if it particularly agreeable to you to have heart disease why i ll try and maintain you have it said augustine_st_clare
i didnt know it was well i only hope you wont be sorry for this when it too late said marie_st_clare
but believe it or not my distress about miss_eva and the exertions i have made with that dear child have developed what i have long suspected
augustine_st_clare quietly made this commentary to himself and went on smoking like a hard hearted wretch of a man as he was till a carriage drove up before the verandah and miss_eva and miss_ophelia alighted
miss_ophelia marched straight to her own chamber to put away her bonnet and shawl as was always her manner before she spoke a word on any subject while miss_eva came at augustine_st_clare call and was sitting on his knee giving him an account of the services they had heard
they soon heard loud exclamations from miss_ophelia room which like the one in which they were sitting opened on to the verandah and violent reproof addressed to somebody
what the exertions were which marie_st_clare referred to it would have been difficult to state what new witchcraft has tops been brewing asked augustine_st_clare
that commotion is of her raising i ll be bound and in a moment after miss_ophelia in high indignation came dragging the culprit along
come out here now she said i will tell your master what the case now asked augustine_st_clare the case is that i cannot be plagued with this child any longer
here i locked her up and gave her a hymn to study and what does she do but spy out where i put my key and has gone to my bureau and got a bonnet trimming and cut it all to pieces to make dolls jackets
it past all bearing flesh and blood cannot endure it i never saw anything like it in my life i told you cousin said marie_st_clare that you find out that these creature cant be brought up without severity
if i had my way now she said looking reproachfully at augustine_st_clare i send that child out and have her thoroughly whipped i have her whipped till she couldnt stand
i never saw above a dozen woman that wouldnt half kill a horse or a servant either if they had their own way with them let alone a man
i dont doubt it said augustine_st_clare tell me of the lovely rule of woman there is no use in this shilly shally way of yours augustine_st_clare said marie_st_clare
miss_ophelia had just the capability of indignation that belongs to the thorough paced housekeeper and this had been pretty actively roused by the artifice and wastefulness of the child in fact many of my lady readers must own that they should have felt just so in her circumstances but marie_st_clare word went beyond her and she felt less heat
i wouldnt have the child treated so for the world she said but i am sure augustine_st_clare i dont know what to do
i ve taught and taught i ve talked till i tired i ve whipped her i ve punished her in every way i can think of and she just what she was at first
cousin is a woman of sense and she sees it now as plain as i do come here tops you monkey said augustine_st_clare calling the child up to him
topsy came up her round hard eye glittering and blinking with a mixture of apprehensiveness and their usual odd drollery
what makes you behave so said augustine_st_clare who could not help being amused with the child expression spects it my wicked heart said topsy demurely miss_feely says so
dont you see how much miss_ophelia has done for you she says she has done everything she can think of
she whipped me a heap harder and used to pull my har and knock my head agin the door but it didnt do me no good
lor yes mas old missis used to say so too i spects if they to pull every spire har out
o my head it wouldnt do no good neither i so wicked law i nothing but a nigger no way
well i shall have to give her up said miss_ophelia i cant have that trouble any longer
why if your gospel is not strong enough to save one heathen child that you can have at home here all to yourself what the use of sending one or two poor missionaries off with it among thousands of just such
well i just like to ask one question said augustine_st_clare what is it i suppose this child is about a fair sample of what thousands of your heathen are
miss_ophelia did not make an immediate answer and miss_eva who had stood a silent spectator of the scene thus far made a silent sign to topsy to follow her
there was a little glass room at the corner of the verandah which augustine_st_clare used as a sort of reading room and miss_eva and topsy disappeared into this place
what miss_eva going about now said augustine_st_clare i mean to see and advancing on tiptoe he lifted up a curtain that covered the glass door and looked in
in a moment laying his finger on his lips he made a silent gesture to miss_ophelia to come and look
topsy with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern but opposite to her miss_eva her whole face fervent with feeling and tear in her large eye
there sat the two child on the floor with their side face towards them what does make you so bad topsy
why wont you try and be good dont you love anybody topsy donno nothing bout love i love candy and sich that all said topsy
but you love your father and mother never had none ye know i telled ye that miss_eva i know said miss_eva sadly but hadnt you any brother or sister or aunt or no none on
em never had nothing nor nobody but topsy if you only try to be good you might couldnt never be nothing but a nigger if i was ever so good said topsy
if i could be skinned and come white i try then but people can love you if you are black topsy
miss_ophelia would love you if you were good topsy gave the short blunt laugh that was her common mode of expressing incredulity
dont you think so said miss_eva no she cant bar me cause i a nigger she s soon have a toad touch her
o topsy poor child i love you said miss_eva with a sudden burst of feeling and laying her little thin white hand on topsy shoulder i love you because you havent had any father or mother or friend because you ve been a poor abused child
there cant nobody love nigger and nigger cant do nothing i dont care said topsy beginning to whistle i love you and i want you to be good
i am very unwell topsy and i think i shant live a great while and it really grieves me to have you be so naughty
i wish you would try to be good for my sake it only a little while i shall be with you
the round keen eye of the black child were overcast with tear large bright drops rolled heavily down one by one and fell on the little white hand
yes in that moment a ray of real belief a ray of heavenly love had penetrated the darkness of her heathen soul
she laid her head down between her knees and wept and sobbed while the beautiful child bending over her looked like the picture of some bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner
poor topsy said miss_eva dont you know that lord_jesus love all alike he is just as willing to love you as me
he will help you to be good and you can go to heaven at last and be an angel forever just as much as if you were white
he love you just as i do only more because he is better only think of it topsy you can be one of those spirit bright uncle tom_loker sings about
dear miss_eva dear miss_eva said the child i will try i will try i never did care nothing about it before
augustine_st_clare at this instant dropped the curtain it puts me in mind of mother he said to miss_ophelia
it is true what she told me if we want to give sight to the blind we must be willing to do as jesus_christ did call them to us and put our hand on them
i ve always had a prejudice against negroes said miss_ophelia and it a fact i never could bear to have that child touch me but i dont think she knew it
but i believe that all the trying in the world to benefit a child and all the substantial favors you can do them will never excite one emotion of gratitude while that feeling of repugnance remains in the heart it a queer kind of a fact but
trust any child to find that out said augustine_st_clare there no keeping it from them so it is
i dont know how i can help it said miss_ophelia they are disagreeable to me this child in particular how can i help feeling so
miss_eva does it seems well she so loving after all though she no more than jesus_christ like said miss_ophelia i wish i were like her
it wouldnt be the first time a little child had been used to instruct an old disciple if it were so said augustine_st_clare
chapter xxvi death weep not for those whom the veil of the tomb in life early morning hath hid from our eye
miss_eva bed room was a spacious apartment which like all the other room in the house opened on to the broad verandah
the room communicated on one side with her father and mother apartment on the other with that appropriated to miss_ophelia
augustine_st_clare had gratified his own eye and taste in furnishing this room in a style that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was intended
the window were hung with curtains of rose colored and white muslin the floor was spread with a matting which had been ordered in paris to a pattern of his own device having round it a border of rose buds and leaves and a centre piece with full flown roses
she might teach me a lesson weep not for those a poem by thomas moore the bedstead chair and lounges were of bamboo wrought in peculiarly graceful and fanciful patterns
over the head of the bed was an alabaster bracket on which a beautiful sculptured angel stood with drooping wings holding out a crown of myrtle leaves
from this depended over the bed light curtains of rose colored gauze striped with silver supplying that protection from mosquitos which is an indispensable addition to all sleeping accommodation in that climate
the graceful bamboo lounges were amply supplied with cushions of rose colored damask while over them depending from the hand of sculptured figures were gauze
a light fanciful bamboo table stood in the middle of the room where a parian vase wrought in the shape of a white lily with its buds stood ever filled with flowers
on this table lay miss_eva book and little trinkets with an elegantly wrought alabaster writing stand which her father had supplied to her when he saw her trying to improve herself in writing
there was a fireplace in the room and on the marble mantle above stood a beautifully wrought statuette of lord_jesus receiving little child and on either side marble vases for which it was tom_loker pride and delight to offer bouquets every morning
curtains similar to those of the bed two or three exquisite paintings of child in various attitudes embellished the wall in short the eye could turn nowhere without meeting images of childhood of beauty and of peace
those little eye never opened in the morning light without falling on something which suggested to the heart soothing and beautiful thoughts
the deceitful strength which had buoyed miss_eva up for a little while was fast passing away seldom and more seldom her light footstep was heard in the verandah and oftener and oftener she was found reclined on a little lounge by the open window her large deep eye fixed on the rising and falling water of the lake
it was towards the middle of the afternoon as she was so reclining her bible half open her little transparent fingers lying listlessly between the
leaves suddenly she heard her mother voice in sharp tone in the verandah what now you baggage what new piece of mischief
you ve been picking the flowers hey and miss_eva heard the sound of a smart slap law missis they for miss_eva she heard a voice say which she knew belonged to topsy
miss_eva a pretty excuse you suppose she wants your flowers you good for nothing nigger get along off with you in a moment miss_eva was off from her lounge and in the verandah
dont mother i should like the flowers do give them to me i want them why miss_eva your room is full now
i cant have too many said miss_eva topsy do bring them here topsy who had stood sullenly holding down her head now came up and offered her flowers
she did it with a look of hesitation and bashfulness quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was usual with her
it a beautiful bouquet said miss_eva looking at it it was rather a singular one a brilliant scarlet geranium and one single white japonica with its glossy leaves
it was tied up with an evident eye to the contrast of color and the arrangement of every leaf had carefully been studied
topsy looked pleased as miss_eva said topsy you arrange flowers very prettily here she said is this vase i havent any flowers for
i wish you arrange something every day for it well that odd said marie_st_clare what in the world do you want that for
never mind mamma you as lief as not topsy should do it had you not of course anything you please dear topsy you hear your young mistress see that you mind
topsy made a short courtesy and looked down and as she turned away miss_eva saw a tear roll down her dark cheek
you see mamma i knew poor topsy wanted to do something for me said miss_eva to her mother
o nonsense it only because she likes to do mischief she knows she mustnt pick flowers so she does it that all there is to it
but if you fancy to have her pluck them so be it mamma i think topsy is different from what she used to be she trying to be a good girl
she ll have to try a good while before she gets to be good said marie_st_clare with a careless laugh
well you know mamma poor topsy everything has always been against her not since she been here i sure if she hasnt been talked to and preached to and every earthly thing done that anybody could
but mamma it so different to be brought up as i ve been with so many friend so many thing to make me good and happy and to be brought up as she been all the time till she came here
do and she just so ugly and always will be you cant make anything of the creature most likely said marie_st_clare yawning dear me how hot it is
mamma you believe dont you that topsy could become an angel as well as any of us if she were a christian
topsy what a ridiculous idea nobody but you would ever think of it i suppose she could though but mamma isnt god her father as much as ours
isnt lord_jesus her saviour well that may be i suppose god made everybody said marie_st_clare where is my smelling bottle
it such a pity oh such a pity said miss_eva looking out on the distant lake and speaking half to herself
why that any one who could be a bright angel and live with angels should go all down down down and nobody help them oh dear
what a pity said marie_st_clare well we cant help it it no use worrying miss_eva i dont know what to be done we ought to be thankful for our own advantages
i hardly can be said miss_eva i so sorry to think of poor folks that havent any that odd enough said marie_st_clare i sure my religion makes me thankful for my advantages
mamma said miss_eva i want to have some of my hair cut off a good deal of it what for said marie_st_clare
mamma i want to give some away to my friend while i am able to give it to them myself
wont you ask aunty to come and cut it for me marie_st_clare raised her voice and called miss_ophelia from the other room
the child half rose from her pillow as she came in and shaking down her long golden brown curls said rather playfully come aunty shear the sheep
what that said augustine_st_clare who just then entered with some fruit he had been out to get for her
papa i just want aunty to cut off some of my hair there too much of it and it makes my head hot
besides i want to give some of it away miss_ophelia came with her scissors take care dont spoil the looks of it said her father cut underneath where it wont show
yes and i want them kept handsome against the time i take you up to your uncle plantation to see cousin henrique said augustine_st_clare in a gay tone
miss_eva curls are my pride papa said miss_eva sadly i shall never go there papa i am going to a better country
o do believe me dont you see papa that i get weaker every day why do you insist that i shall believe such a cruel thing miss_eva said her father
only because it is true papa and if you will believe it now perhaps you will get to feel about it as i do
augustine_st_clare closed his lips and stood gloomily eying the long beautiful curls which as they were separated from the child head were laid one by one in her lap
she raised them up looked earnestly at them twined them around her thin fingers and looked from time to time anxiously at her father
it just what has been preying on my health from day to day bringing me downward to the grave though nobody regards it
it just what i ve been foreboding said marie_st_clare i have seen this long augustine_st_clare you will see after a while that i was right
which will afford you great consolation no doubt said augustine_st_clare in a dry bitter tone marie_st_clare lay back on a lounge and covered her face with her cambric handkerchief
it was the calm comprehending gaze of a soul half loosed from its earthly bonds it was evident she saw felt and appreciated the difference between the two
miss_eva clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other she beckoned with her hand to her father he came and sat down by her
papa my strength fades away every day and i know i must go there are some thing i want to say
and do that i ought to do and you are so unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject but it must come there no putting it off
my child i am willing said augustine_st_clare covering his eye with one hand and holding up miss_eva hand with the other
do be willing i should speak now then i want to see all our people together i have some thing i must say to them said miss_eva
well said augustine_st_clare in a tone of dry endurance miss_ophelia despatched a messenger and soon the whole of the servant were convened in the room
miss_eva lay back on her pillows her hair hanging loosely about her face her crimson cheeks contrasting painfully with the intense whiteness of her complexion and the thin contour of her limbs and features and her large soul like eye fixed earnestly on every one
the spiritual face the long locks of hair cut off and lying by her her father averted face and marie_st_clare sobs struck at once upon the feeling of a sensitive and impressible race and as they came in they looked one on another sighed and shook their head
the servant were struck with a sudden emotion there was a deep silence like that of a funeral miss_eva raised herself and looked long and earnestly round at every one
all looked sad and apprehensive many of the woman hid their face in their aprons i sent for you all my dear friend said miss_eva because i love you
i love you all and i have something to say to you which i want you always to remember
here the child was interrupted by bursts of groans sobs and lamentations which broke from all present and in which her slender voice was lost entirely
she waited a moment and then speaking in a tone that checked the sobs of all she said if you love me you must not interrupt me so
i am going to leave you in a few more weeks you will see me no more listen to what i say
i want to speak to you about your soul many of you i am afraid are very careless
you are thinking only about this world i want you to remember that there is a beautiful world where lord_jesus is
i am going there and you can go there it is for you as much as me but if you want to go there you must not live idle careless thoughtless life
you must be christians you must remember that each one of you can become angels and be angels forever
if you want to be christians lord_jesus will help you you must pray to him you must read the child checked herself looked piteously at them and said sorrowfully dear
and she hid her face in the pillow and sobbed while many a smothered sob from those she was addressing who were kneeling on the floor aroused her
never mind she said raising her face and smiling brightly through her tear i have prayed for you and i know lord_jesus will help you even if you cant read
try all to do the best you can pray every day ask him to help you and get the bible read to you whenever you can and i think i shall see you all in heaven
amen was the murmured response from the lips of tom_loker and mammy and some of the elder one who belonged to the methodist church
you cant read poor soul the younger and more thoughtless one for the time completely overcome were sobbing with their head bowed upon their knees
i know said miss_eva you all love me yes oh yes indeed we do lord bless her was the involuntary answer of all
there isnt one of you that hasnt always been very kind to me and i want to give you something that when you look at you shall always remember me i going to give all of you a curl of my hair and when you look at it think that i loved you and am gone to heaven and that i want to see you all there
it is impossible to describe the scene as with tear and sobs they gathered round the little creature and took from her hand what seemed to them a last mark of her love
they fell on their knees they sobbed and prayed and kissed the hem of her garment and the elder one poured forth word of endearment mingled in prayers and blessings after the manner of their susceptible race
as each one took their gift miss_ophelia who was apprehensive for the effect of all this excitement on her little patient signed to each one to pass out of the apartment
yes i know you do at last all were gone but tom_loker and mammy here uncle tom_loker said miss_eva is a beautiful one for you
o i am so happy uncle tom_loker to think i shall see you in heaven for i sure i shall and mammy dear good kind mammy
she said fondly throwing her arm round her old nurse i know you ll be there too miss_eva dont see how i can live without ye no how said the faithful creature
pears like it just taking everything off the place to oncet and mammy gave way to a passion of grief
miss_ophelia pushed her and tom_loker gently from the apartment and thought they were all gone but as she turned topsy was standing there
where did you start up from she said suddenly i was here said topsy wiping the tear from her eye
miss_eva i ve been a bad girl but wont you give me one too yes poor topsy to be sure i will
there every time you look at that think that i love you and wanted you to be a good girl miss_eva i is tryin said topsy earnestly but lor it so hard to be good
pears like i ant used to it no way lord_jesus knows it topsy he is sorry for you he will help you
topsy with her eye hid in her apron was silently passed from the apartment by miss_ophelia but as she went she hid the precious curl in her bosom
that worthy lady had wiped away many tear of her own during the scene but concern for the consequence of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in her mind
all being gone miss_ophelia shut the door augustine_st_clare had been sitting during the whole time with his hand shading his eye in the same attitude
when they were all gone he sat so still papa said miss_eva gently laying her hand on his he gave a sudden start and shiver but made no answer
dear papa said miss_eva i cannot said augustine_st_clare rising i cannot have it so the almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me and augustine_st_clare pronounced these word with a bitter emphasis indeed
perhaps so but that doesnt make it any easier to bear said he with a dry hard tearless manner as he turned away
augustine_st_clare has not god a right to do what he will with his own said miss_ophelia papa you break my heart said miss_eva rising and throwing herself into his arm you must not feel so
and the child sobbed and wept with a violence which alarmed them all and turned her father thoughts at once to another channel
there miss_eva there dearest hush hush i was wrong i was wicked i will feel any way do any way only dont distress yourself dont sob so
miss_eva soon lay like a wearied dove in her father arm and he bending over her soothed her by every tender word he could think of
i will be resigned i was wicked to speak as i did marie_st_clare rose and threw herself out of the apartment into her own when she fell into violent hysterics
they are all yours papa said she smiling yours and mamma and you must give dear aunty as many as she wants
i only gave them to our poor people myself because you know papa they might be forgotten when i am gone and
you didnt give me a curl miss_eva said her father smiling sadly because i hoped it might help them remember
you are a christian are you not papa said miss_eva doubtfully why do you ask me i dont know
you are so good i dont see how you can help it what is being a christian miss_eva
loving jesus_christ most of all said miss_eva do you miss_eva certainly i do you never saw him said augustine_st_clare
i believe him and in a few day i shall see him and the young face grew fervent radiant with joy
that makes no difference said miss_eva augustine_st_clare said no more it was a feeling which he had seen before in his mother but no chord within vibrated to it
miss_eva after this declined rapidly there was no more any doubt of the event the fondest hope could not be blinded
her beautiful room was avowedly a sick room and miss_ophelia day and night performed the duties of a nurse and never did her friend appreciate her value more than in that capacity
with so well trained a hand and eye such perfect adroitness and practice in every art which could promote neatness and comfort and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of sickness with such a perfect sense of time such a clear untroubled head such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and direction of the doctors she was everything to him
they who had shrugged their shoulders at her little peculiarities and setnesses so unlike the careless freedom of southern manner acknowledged that now she was the exact person that was wanted
the child suffered much from nervous restlessness and it was a relief to her to be carried and it was tom_loker greatest delight to carry her little frail form in his arm resting on a pillow now up and down her room now out into the verandah and when the fresh sea breezes blew from the lake and
the child felt freshest in the morning he would sometimes walk with her under the orange trees in the garden or sitting down in some of their old seats sing to her their favorite old hymns
her father often did the same thing but his frame was slighter and when he was weary miss_eva would say to him papa let tom_loker take me
uncle tom_loker was much in miss_eva room poor fellow it pleases him and you know it all he can do now and he wants to do something
so do i miss_eva said her father well papa you can do everything and are everything to me you read to me you sit up night and
tom_loker has only this one thing and his singing and i know too he does it easier than you can he carries me so strong
the desire to do something was not confined to tom_loker every servant in the establishment showed the same feeling and in their way did what they could
poor mammy heart yearned towards her darling but she found no opportunity night or day as marie_st_clare declared that the state of her mind was such it was impossible for her to rest and of course it was against her principles to let any one else rest
twenty time in a night mammy would be roused to rub her foot to bathe her head to find her pocket handkerchief to see what the noise was in miss_eva room to let down a curtain because it was too light or to put it up because it was too dark and in the daytime when she longed to have some share in the nursing of her pet marie_st_clare seemed unusually ingenious in keeping her busy anywhere and everywhere all over the house or about her own person so that stolen interviews and momentary glimpses were all she could obtain
i feel it my duty to be particularly careful of myself now she would say feeble as i am and with the whole care and nursing of that dear child upon me
you talk like a man augustine_st_clare just as if a mother could be relieved of the care of a child in that state but then it all alike no one ever knows what i feel
indeed my dear said augustine_st_clare i thought our cousin relieved you of that i cant throw thing off as you do
for so bright and placid was the farewell voyage of the little spirit by such sweet and fragrant breezes was the small bark borne towards the heavenly
augustine_st_clare smiled you must excuse him he couldnt help it for augustine_st_clare could smile yet shores that it was impossible to realize that it was death that was approaching
the child felt no pain only a tranquil soft weakness daily and almost insensibly increasing and she was so beautiful so loving so trustful so happy that one could not resist the soothing influence of that air of innocence and peace which seemed to breathe around her
it was not hope that was impossible it was not resignation it was only a calm resting in the present which seemed so beautiful that he wished to think of no future
it was like that hush of spirit which we feel amid the bright mild woods of autumn when the bright hectic flush is on the trees and the last lingering flowers by the brook and we joy in it all the more because we know that soon it will all pass away
augustine_st_clare found a strange calm coming over him the friend who knew most of miss_eva own imaginings and foreshadowings was her faithful bearer tom_loker
to him she imparted those mysterious intimations which the soul feels as the cords begin to unbind ere it leaves its clay forever
tom_loker at last would not sleep in his room but lay all night in the outer verandah ready to rouse at every call
to him she said what she would not disturb her father by saying uncle tom_loker what alive have you taken to sleeping anywhere and everywhere like a dog for said miss_ophelia
i thought you was one of the orderly sort that liked to lie in bed in a christian way
i do miss_feely said tom_loker mysteriously i do but now well what now we mustnt speak loud
mas augustine_st_clare wont hear ont but miss_feely you know there must be somebody watchin for the bridegroom
what do you mean tom_loker you know it says in scripture at midnight there was a great cry made behold the bridegroom cometh
that what i spectin now every night miss_feely and i couldnt sleep out hearin no way why uncle tom_loker what makes you think so
i must be thar miss_feely for when that ar blessed child goes into the kingdom they ll open the door so wide we ll all get a look in at the glory miss_feely
miss_eva she talks to me the lord he sends his messenger in the soul uncle tom_loker did miss_eva say she felt more unwell than usual tonight
no but she telled me this morning she was coming nearer thar them that tells it to the child miss_feely
this dialogue passed between miss_ophelia and tom_loker between ten and eleven one evening after her arrangements had all been made for the night when on going to bolt her outer door she found tom_loker stretched along by it in the outer verandah
it the angels it the trumpet sound afore the break day said tom_loker quoting from a favorite hymn she was not nervous or impressible but the solemn heart felt manner struck her
miss_eva had been unusually bright and cheerful that afternoon and had sat raised in her bed and looked over all her little trinkets and precious thing and designated the friend to whom she would have them given and her manner was more animated and her voice more natural than they had known it for weeks
her father had been in in the evening and had said that miss_eva appeared more like her former self than ever she had done since her sickness and when he kissed her for the night he said to miss_ophelia cousin we may keep her with us after all she is certainly better and he had retired with a lighter heart in his bosom than he had had there for weeks
but at midnight strange mystic hour when the veil between the frail present and the eternal future grows thin then came the messenger there was a sound in that chamber first of one who stepped quickly
it was miss_ophelia who had resolved to sit up all night with her little charge and who at the turn of the night had discerned what experienced nurses significantly call a change
the outer door was quickly opened and tom_loker who was watching outside was on the alert in a moment
go for the doctor tom_loker lose not a moment said miss_ophelia and stepping across the room she rapped at augustine_st_clare door
cousin she said i wish you would come those word fell on his heart like clods upon a coffin
why did they he was up and in the room in an instant and bending over miss_eva who still slept what was it
thou canst say who hast seen that same expression on the face dearest to thee that look indescribable hopeless unmistakable that says to thee that thy beloved is no longer thine
on the face of the child however there was no ghastly imprint only a high and almost sublime expression the overshadowing presence of spiritual nature the dawning of immortal life in that childish soul
he saw that made his heart stand still why was no word spoken between the two they stood there so still gazing upon her that even the ticking of the watch seemed too loud
in a few moment tom_loker returned with the doctor he entered gave one look and stood silent as the rest
when did this change take place said he in a low whisper to miss_ophelia about the turn of the night was the reply
marie_st_clare roused by the entrance of the doctor appeared hurriedly from the next room augustine_st_clare cousin what she hurriedly began
the house was soon roused light were seen footsteps heard anxious face thronged the verandah and looked tearfully through the glass door but augustine_st_clare heard and said nothing he saw only that look on the face of the little sleeper
hush said augustine_st_clare hoarsely she is dying mammy heard the word and flew to awaken the servant
o if she would only wake and speak once more he said and stooping over her he spoke in her ear miss_eva darling
the large blue eye unclosed a smile passed over her face she tried to raise her head and to speak do you know me miss_eva
in a moment they dropped again and as augustine_st_clare raised his head he saw a spasm of mortal agony pass over the face she struggled for breath and threw up her little hand
dear papa said the child with a last effort throwing her arm about his neck god this is dreadful
he said turning away in agony and wringing tom_loker hand scarce conscious what he was doing tom_loker my boy it is killing me
tom_loker had his master hand between his own and with tear streaming down his dark cheeks looked up for help where he had always been used to look
pray that this may be cut short said augustine_st_clare this wrings my heart bless the lord it over it over dear master
said tom_loker look at her the child lay panting on her pillows as one exhausted the large clear eye rolled up and fixed
earth was past and earthly pain but so solemn so mysterious was the triumphant brightness of that face that it checked even the sobs of sorrow
ah what said those eye that spoke so much of heaven they pressed around her in breathless stillness miss_eva said augustine_st_clare gently
she did not hear miss_eva tell us what you see what is it said her father a bright a glorious smile passed over her face and she said brokenly
love joy peace gave one sigh and passed from death unto life farewell beloved child the bright eternal door have closed after thee we shall see thy sweet face no more
o woe for them who watched thy entrance into heaven when they shall wake and find only the cold gray sky of daily life and thou gone forever
chapter xxvii this is the last of earth this is the last of earth i am content last word of john_bunyan quincy adams uttered february
the statuettes and pictures in miss_eva room were shrouded in white napkins and only hushed breathings and muffled footfalls were heard there and the light stole in solemnly through window partially darkened by closed blinds
there she lay robed in one of the simple white dresses she had been wont to wear when living the rose colored light through the curtains cast over the icy coldness of death a warm glow
the heavy eyelashes drooped softly on the pure cheek the head was turned a little to one side as if in natural sleep but there was diffused over every lineament of the face that high celestial expression that mingling of rapture and repose which showed it was no earthly or temporary sleep but the long sacred rest which he giveth to his beloved
the bed was draped in white and there beneath the drooping angel figure lay a little sleeping form sleeping never to waken
neither darkness nor shadow of death only such a bright fading as when the morning star fades in the golden dawn
there is no death to such as thou dear miss_eva thine is the victory without the battle the crown without the conflict
so did augustine_st_clare think as with folded arm he stood there gazing ah who shall say what he did think
for from the hour that voice had said in the dying chamber she is gone it had been all a dreary mist a heavy dimness of anguish
he had heard voice around him he had had questions asked and answered them they had asked him when he would have the funeral and where they should lay her and he had answered impatiently that he cared not
mr_adolph and miss_rosa had arranged the chamber volatile fickle and childish as they generally were they were soft hearted and full of feeling and while miss_ophelia presided over the general details of order and neatness it was their hand that added those soft poetic touches to the arrangements
that took from the death room the grim and ghastly air which too often marks a new england funeral there were still flowers on the shelves all white delicate and fragrant with graceful drooping leaves
the folds of the drapery the fall of the curtains had been arranged and rearranged by mr_adolph and miss_rosa with that nicety of eye which characterizes their race
even now while augustine_st_clare stood there thinking little miss_rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a basket of white flowers
she stepped back when she saw augustine_st_clare and stopped respectfully but seeing that he did not observe her she came forward to place them around the dead
augustine_st_clare saw her as in a dream while she placed in the small hand a fair cape jessamine and with admirable taste disposed other flowers around the couch
miss_eva little table covered with white bore on it her favorite vase with a single white moss rose bud in it the door opened again and topsy her eye swelled with crying appeared holding something under her apron
miss_rosa made a quick forbidding gesture but she took a step into the room you must go out said miss_rosa in a sharp positive whisper you havent any business here
do let me i brought a flower such a pretty one said topsy holding up a half blown tea rose bud do let me put just one there
get along said miss_rosa more decidedly let her stay said augustine_st_clare suddenly stamping his foot she shall come
miss_rosa suddenly retreated and topsy came forward and laid her offering at the foot of the corpse then suddenly with a wild and bitter cry she threw herself on the floor alongside the bed and wept and moaned aloud
miss_ophelia hastened into the room and tried to raise and silence her but in vain miss_eva oh miss_eva
there was a piercing wildness in the cry the blood flushed into augustine_st_clare white marble like face and the first tear he had shed since miss_eva died stood in his eye
i wish i dead too i do get up child said miss_ophelia in a softened voice dont cry so
miss_eva is gone to heaven she is an angel but i cant see her said topsy i never shall see her and she sobbed again
they all stood a moment in silence she said she loved me said topsy she did dear oh dear there
that true enough said augustine_st_clare but do he said to miss_ophelia see if you cant comfort the poor creature
ant nobody left now there ant i jist wish i hadnt never been born said topsy i didnt want to be born no way and i dont see no use ont
miss_ophelia raised her gently but firmly and took her from the room but as she did so some tear fell from her eye
topsy you poor child she said as she led her into her room dont give up i can love you though i am not like that dear little child
i hope i ve learnt something of the love of jesus_christ from her i can love you i do and i ll try to help you to grow up a good christian girl
miss_ophelia voice was more than her word and more than that were the honest tear that fell down her face
o my miss_eva whose little hour on earth did so much of good thought augustine_st_clare what account have i to give for my long year
from that hour she acquired an influence over the mind of the destitute child that she never lost
there were for a while soft whisperings and footfalls in the chamber as one after another stole in to look at the dead and then came the little coffin and then there was a funeral and carriages drove to the door and strangers came and were seated and there were white scarfs and ribbons and crape bands and mourners dressed in black crape and there were word read from the bible and
prayers offered and augustine_st_clare lived and walked and moved as one who has shed every tear to the last he saw only one thing that golden head in the coffin but then he saw the cloth spread over it the lid of the coffin closed and he walked when he was put beside the others down to a little place at the bottom of the garden and there by the mossy seat where she and tom_loker had talked and sung and read so often was the little grave
augustine_st_clare stood beside it looked vacantly down he saw them lower the little coffin he heard dimly the solemn word i am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and as the earth was cast in and filled up the little grave he could not realize that it was his miss_eva that they were hiding from his sight
nor was it not miss_eva but only the frail seed of that bright immortal form with which she shall yet come forth in the day of the lord_jesus
and then all were gone and the mourners went back to the place which should know her no more and marie_st_clare room was darkened and she lay on the bed sobbing and moaning in uncontrollable grief and calling every moment for the attentions of all her servant
the grief was her grief and she was fully convinced that nobody on earth did could or would feel it as she did
augustine_st_clare did not shed a tear she said he didnt sympathize with her it was perfectly wonderful to think how hard hearted and unfeeling he was when he must know how she suffered
so much are people the slave of their eye and ear that many of the servant really thought that missis was the principal sufferer in the case especially as marie_st_clare began to have hysterical spasms and sent for the doctor and at last declared herself dying and in the running and scampering and bringing up hot bottles and heating of flannels and chafing and fussing that ensued there was quite a diversion
of course they had no time to cry why should they tom_loker however had a feeling at his own heart that drew him to his master
he followed him wherever he walked wistfully and sadly and when he saw him sitting so pale and quiet in miss_eva room holding before his eye her little open bible though seeing no letter or word of what was in it there was more sorrow to tom_loker in that still fixed tearless eye than in all marie_st_clare moans and lamentations
in a few day the augustine_st_clare family were back again in the city augustine_st_clare with the restlessness of grief longing for another scene to change the current of his thoughts
so they left the house and garden with its little grave and came back to new orleans and augustine_st_clare walked the streets busily and strove to fill up the chasm in his heart with hurry and bustle and change of place and people who saw him in the street or met him at the cafe knew of his loss only by the weed on his hat for there he was smiling and talking and reading the newspaper and speculating on politics and attending to business matter and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre
i used to think if there was anything in the world he did love it was our dear little miss_eva but he seems to be forgetting her very easily
mr augustine_st_clare is a singular man said marie_st_clare to miss_ophelia in a complaining tone i cannot ever get him to talk about her
i really did think he would show more feeling still water run deepest they used to tell me said miss_ophelia oracularly
i dont believe in such thing it all talk if people have feeling they will show it they cant help it but then it a great misfortune to have feeling
i rather have been made like augustine_st_clare my feeling prey upon me so sure missis mas augustine_st_clare is gettin thin as a shader
they say he dont never eat nothing said mammy i know he dont forget miss_eva i know there couldnt nobody dear little blessed cretur
well at all events he has no consideration for me said marie_st_clare he hasnt spoken one word of sympathy and he must know how much more a mother feels than any man can
she added wiping her eye the heart knoweth its own bitterness said miss_ophelia gravely that just what i think
i know just what i feel nobody else seems to miss_eva used to but she is gone and marie_st_clare lay back on her lounge and began to sob disconsolately
marie_st_clare was one of those unfortunately constituted mortals in whose eye whatever is lost and gone assumes a value which it never had in possession
whatever she had she seemed to survey only to pick flaws in it but once fairly away there was no end to her valuation of it
tom_loker who was always uneasily following his master about had seen him go to his library some hour before and after vainly waiting for him to come out determined at last to make an errand in
while this conversation was taking place in the parlor another was going on in augustine_st_clare library he entered softly augustine_st_clare lay on his lounge at the further end of the room
he was lying on his face with miss_eva bible open before him at a little distance tom_loker walked up and stood by the sofa
he hesitated and while he was hesitating augustine_st_clare suddenly raised himself up the honest face so full of grief and with such an imploring expression of affection and sympathy struck his master
he laid his hand on tom_loker and bowed down his forehead on it tom_loker my boy the whole world is as empty as an egg shell
i know it mas i know it said tom_loker but oh if mas could only look up up where our dear miss_eva is up to the dear lord_jesus
ah tom_loker i do look up but the trouble is i dont see anything when i do i wish i could
it seems to be given to child and poor honest fellow like you to see what we cant said augustine_st_clare
thou has hid from the wise and prudent and revealed unto babes murmured tom_loker even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight
tom_loker sighed heavily how comes it tom_loker i dont believe i cant believe i ve got the habit of doubting said augustine_st_clare
i want to believe this bible and i cant dear mas pray to the good lord lord i believe help thou my unbelief
was all that beautiful love and faith only one of the ever shifting phases of human feeling having nothing real to rest on passing away with the little breath
who knows anything about anything said augustine_st_clare his eye wandering dreamily and speaking to himself and is there no more miss_eva no heaven no jesus_christ nothing
dear mas there is i know it i sure of it said tom_loker falling on his knees do do dear mas believe it
how do you know there any jesus_christ tom_loker you never saw the lord felt him in my soul mas feel him now
o mas when i was sold away from my old woman and the child i was jest a most broke up i felt as if there warn t
nothing left and then the good lord he stood by me and he says fear not tom_loker and he brings light and joy in a poor feller soul makes all peace and i so happy and love everybody and feels willin jest to be the lord and have the lord will done and be put jest where the lord wants to put me
i know it couldnt come from me cause i a poor complainin cretur it comes from the lord and i know he willin to do for mas
tom_loker spoke with fast running tear and choking voice augustine_st_clare leaned his head on his shoulder and wrung the hard faithful black hand
tom_loker you love me he said i willin to lay down my life this blessed day to see mas a christian
poor foolish boy said augustine_st_clare half raising himself i not worth the love of one good honest heart like yours
mas dere more than me love you the blessed lord_jesus love you how do you know that tom_loker said augustine_st_clare
singular said augustine_st_clare turning away that the story of a man that lived and died eighteen hundred year ago can affect people so yet
feels it in my soul mas the love of jesus_christ that passeth knowledge but he was no man he added suddenly
no man ever had such long and living power that i could believe what my mother taught me and pray as i did when i was a boy
if mas pleases said tom_loker miss_eva used to read this so beautifully i wish mas d be so good as read it
dont get no readin hardly now miss_eva gone the chapter was the eleventh of john_bunyan the touching account of the raising of lazarus
augustine_st_clare read it aloud often pausing to wrestle down feeling which were roused by the pathos of the story tom_loker knelt before him with clasped hand and with an absorbed expression of love trust adoration on his quiet face
tom_loker said his master this is all real to you i can jest fairly see it mas said tom_loker
but tom_loker you know that i have a great deal more knowledge than you what if i should tell you that i dont believe this bible
i wish i had your eye tom_loker i wish to the dear lord mas had mas said tom_loker holding up his hand with a deprecating gesture
wouldnt it shake your faith some tom_loker not a grain said tom_loker why tom_loker you must know i know the most
mas havent you jest read how he hides from the wise and prudent and reveals unto babes but mas wasnt in earnest for sartin now said tom_loker anxiously
no tom_loker i was not i dont disbelieve and i think there is reason to believe and still i dont
it a troublesome bad habit i ve got tom_loker if mas would only pray how do you know i dont tom_loker
does mas i would tom_loker if there was anybody there when i pray but it all speaking unto nothing when i do
but come tom_loker you pray now and show me how tom_loker heart was full he poured it out in prayer like water that have been long suppressed
in fact augustine_st_clare felt himself borne on the tide of his faith and feeling almost to the gates of that heaven he seemed so vividly to conceive
one thing was plain enough tom_loker thought there was somebody to hear whether there were or not it seemed to bring him nearer to miss_eva
thank you my boy said augustine_st_clare when tom_loker rose i like to hear you tom_loker but go now and leave me alone
chapter xxviii reunion week after week glided away in the augustine_st_clare mansion and the waves of life settled back to their usual flow where that little bark had gone down
for how imperiously how coolly in disregard of all one feeling does the hard cold uninteresting course of daily realities move on
still must we eat and drink and sleep and wake again still bargain buy sell ask and answer questions pursue in short a thousand shadows though all interest in them be over the cold mechanical habit of living remaining after all vital interest in it has fled
some other time i ll talk more tom_loker silently left the room all the interests and hopes of augustine_st_clare life had unconsciously wound themselves around this child
it was for miss_eva that he had managed his property it was for miss_eva that he had planned the disposal of his time and to do this and that for miss_eva to buy improve alter and arrange or dispose something for
her had been so long his habit that now she was gone there seemed nothing to be thought of and nothing to be done
true there was another life a life which once believed in stands as a solemn significant figure before the otherwise unmeaning ciphers of time changing them to orders of mysterious untold value
augustine_st_clare knew this well and often in many a weary hour he heard that slender childish voice calling him to the skies and saw that little hand pointing to him the way of life but a heavy lethargy of sorrow lay on him he could not arise
he had one of those nature which could better and more clearly conceive of religious thing from its own perceptions and instincts than many a matter of fact and practical christian
the gift to appreciate and the sense to feel the finer shades and relations of moral thing often seems an attribute of those whose whole life shows a careless disregard of them
hence moore byron goethe often speak word more wisely descriptive of the true religious sentiment than another man whose whole life is governed by it
augustine_st_clare had never pretended to govern himself by any religious obligation and a certain fineness of nature gave him such an instinctive view of the extent of the requirements of christianity that he shrank by anticipation from what he felt would be the exactions of his own conscience if he once did resolve to assume them
for so inconsistent is human nature especially in the ideal that not to undertake a thing at all seems better than to undertake and come short
in such mind disregard of religion is a more fearful treason a more deadly sin still augustine_st_clare was in many respects another man
he read his little miss_eva bible seriously and honestly he thought more soberly and practically of his relations to his servant enough to make him extremely dissatisfied with both his past and present course and one thing he did soon after his return to new orleans and that was to commence the legal steps necessary to tom_loker emancipation which was to be perfected as soon as he could get through the necessary formalities
in all the wide world there was nothing that seemed to remind him so much of miss_eva and he would insist on keeping him constantly about him and fastidious and unapproachable as he was with regard to his deeper feeling he almost thought aloud to tom_loker
nor would any one have wondered at it who had seen the expression of affection and devotion with which tom_loker continually followed his young master
well tom_loker said augustine_st_clare the day after he had commenced the legal formalities for his enfranchisement i going to make a free man of you so have your trunk packed and get ready to set out for kentuck
the sudden light of joy that shone in tom_loker face as he raised his hand to heaven his emphatic bless the lord rather discomposed augustine_st_clare he did not like it that tom_loker should be so ready to leave him

marie_st_clare augustine_st_clare felt the loss of miss_eva as deeply as she could feel anything and as she was a woman that had a great faculty of making everybody unhappy when she was her immediate attendants had still stronger reason to regret the loss of their young mistress whose winning way and gentle intercessions had so often been a shield to them from the tyrannical and selfish exactions of her mother
poor old mammy in particular whose heart severed from all natural domestic ties had consoled itself with this one beautiful being was almost heart broken
she cried day and night and was from excess of sorrow less skilful and alert in her ministrations of her mistress than usual which drew down a constant storm of invectives on her defenceless head
the conversation was here interrupted by the announcement of some visitors miss_ophelia felt the loss but in her good and honest heart it bore fruit unto everlasting life
she was more softened more gentle and though equally assiduous in every duty it was with a chastened and quiet air as one who communed with her own heart not in vain
she was more diligent in teaching topsy taught her mainly from the bible did not any longer shrink from her touch or manifest an ill repressed disgust because she felt none
she viewed her now through the softened medium that miss_eva hand had first held before her eye and saw in her only an immortal creature whom god had sent to be led by her to glory and virtue
topsy did not become at once a saint but the life and death of miss_eva did work a marked change in her
the callous indifference was gone there was now sensibility hope desire and the striving for good a strife irregular interrupted suspended oft but yet renewed again
one day when topsy had been sent for by miss_ophelia she came hastily thrusting something into her bosom what are you doing there you limb
you ve been stealing something i ll be bound said the imperious little miss_rosa who had been sent to call her seizing her at the same time roughly by the arm
none your sa ce said miss_rosa i saw you hiding something i know yer tricks and miss_rosa seized her arm and tried to force her hand into her bosom while topsy enraged kicked and fought valiantly for what she considered her rights
you go long miss_rosa said topsy pulling from her tant none your business the clamor and confusion of the battle drew miss_ophelia and augustine_st_clare both to the spot
she been stealing said miss_rosa i hant neither vociferated topsy sobbing with passion give me that whatever it is said miss_ophelia firmly
topsy hesitated but on a second order pulled out of her bosom a little parcel done up in the foot of one of her own old stockings
there was a small book which had been given to topsy by miss_eva containing a single verse of scripture arranged for every day in the year and in a paper the curl of hair that she had given her on that memorable day when she had taken her last farewell
augustine_st_clare was a good deal affected at the sight of it the little book had been rolled in a long strip of black crape torn from the funeral weeds
miss_ophelia turned it out what did you wrap this round the book for said augustine_st_clare holding up the crape
she said and sitting flat down on the floor and putting her apron over her head she began to sob vehemently
cause cause causet was miss_eva dont take em away please it was a curious mixture of the pathetic and the ludicrous the little old stockings black crape text book fair soft curl and topsy utter distress
augustine_st_clare smiled but there were tear in his eye as he said come come dont cry you shall have them and putting them together he threw them into her lap and drew miss_ophelia with him into the parlor
i really think you can make something of that concern he said pointing with his thumb backward over his shoulder
any mind that is capable of a real sorrow is capable of good you must try and do something with her
i have great hopes of her but augustine_st_clare she said laying her hand on his arm one thing i want to ask whose is this child to be yours or mine
the child has improved greatly said miss_ophelia why i gave her to you said augustine_st_clare but not legally i want her to be mine legally said miss_ophelia
whew cousin said augustine_st_clare what will the abolition society think they ll have a day of fasting appointed for this backsliding if you become a slaveholder
i want her mine that i may have a right to take her to the free state and give her her liberty that all i am trying to do be not undone
nonsense cousin what an awful doing evil that good may come i cant encourage it i dont want you to joke but to reason said miss_ophelia
there is no use in my trying to make this child a christian child unless i save her from all the chances and reverses of slavery and if you really are willing i should have her i want you to give me a deed of gift or some legal paper
well well said augustine_st_clare i will and he sat down and unfolded a newspaper to read but i want it done now said miss_ophelia
what your hurry because now is the only time there ever is to do a thing in said miss_ophelia
augustine_st_clare like most man of his class of mind cordially hated the present tense of action generally and therefore he was considerably annoyed by miss_ophelia downrightness
come now here paper pen and ink just write a paper why what the matter said he cant you take my word
one would think you had taken lessons of the jews coming at a fellow so i want to make sure of it said miss_ophelia
you may die or fail and then topsy be hustled off to auction spite of all i can do really you are quite provident
well seeing i in the hand of a yankee there is nothing for it but to concede and augustine_st_clare rapidly wrote off a deed of gift which as he was well versed in the form of law he could easily do and signed his name to it in sprawling capitals concluding by a tremendous flourish
there isnt that black and white now miss vermont he said as he handed it to her good boy said miss_ophelia smiling
but must it not be witnessed bother yes here he said opening the door into marie_st_clare apartment marie_st_clare cousin wants your autograph just put your name down here
what this said marie_st_clare as she ran over the paper ridiculous i thought cousin was too pious for such horrid thing she added as she carelessly wrote her name
but if she has a fancy for that article i am sure she welcome there now she yours body and soul said augustine_st_clare handing the paper
no more mine now than she was before miss_ophelia nobody but god has a right to give her to me but i can protect her now
well she yours by a fiction of law then said augustine_st_clare as he turned back into the parlor and sat down to his paper
miss_ophelia who seldom sat much in marie_st_clare company followed him into the parlor having first carefully laid away the paper
augustine_st_clare she said suddenly as she sat knitting have you ever made any provision for your servant in case of your death
no said augustine_st_clare as he read on then all your indulgence to them may prove a great cruelty by and by
augustine_st_clare had often thought the same thing himself but he answered negligently well i mean to make a provision by and by
when said miss_ophelia one of these day what if you should die first cousin what the matter said augustine_st_clare laying down his paper and looking at her
do you think i show symptoms of yellow fever or cholera that you are making post mortem arrangements with such zeal
augustine_st_clare rose up and laying the paper down carelessly walked to the door that stood open on the verandah to put an end to a conversation that was not agreeable to him
in the midst of life we are in death said miss_ophelia mechanically he repeated the last word again death
and as he leaned against the railings and watched the sparkling water as it rose and fell in the fountain and as in a dim and dizzy haze saw flowers and trees and vases of the courts he repeated again the mystic word so common in every mouth yet of such fearful power death
strange that there should be such a word he said and such a thing and we ever forget it that one should be living warm and beautiful full of hopes desires and wants one day and the next be gone utterly gone and forever
it was a warm golden evening and as he walked to the other end of the verandah he saw tom_loker busily intent on his bible pointing as he did so with his finger to each successive word and whispering them to himself with an earnest air
want me to read to you tom_loker said augustine_st_clare seating himself carelessly by him if mas pleases said tom_loker gratefully mas makes it so much plainer
augustine_st_clare took the book and glanced at the place and began reading one of the passages which tom_loker had designated by the heavy marks around it
it ran as follows when the son of man shall come in his glory and all his holy angels with him then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory and before him shall be gathered all nations and he shall separate them one from another as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats
augustine_st_clare read on in an animated voice till he came to the last of the verses then shall the king say unto him on his left hand depart from me ye cursed into everlasting fire
for i was an hungered and ye gave me no meat i was thirsty and ye gave me no drink i was a stranger and ye took me not in naked and ye clothed me not
then shall they answer unto him lord when saw we thee an hungered or athirst or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and did not minister unto thee
then shall he say unto them inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of these my brethren
augustine_st_clare seemed struck with this last passage for he read it twice the second time slowly and as if he were revolving the word in his mind
tom_loker he said these folks that get such hard measure seem to have been doing just what i have living good easy respectable life and not troubling themselves to inquire how many of their brethren were hungry or athirst or sick or in prison
i was sick and in prison and ye visited me not ye did it not to me tom_loker did not answer
augustine_st_clare rose up and walked thoughtfully up and down the verandah seeming to forget everything in his own thoughts so absorbed was he that tom_loker had to remind him twice that the teabell had rung before he could get his attention
augustine_st_clare was absent and thoughtful all tea time after tea he and marie_st_clare and miss_ophelia took possession of the parlor almost in silence
marie_st_clare disposed herself on a lounge under a silken mosquito curtain and was soon sound asleep miss_ophelia silently busied herself with her knitting
augustine_st_clare sat down to the piano and began playing a soft and melancholy movement with the æolian accompaniment he seemed in a deep reverie and to be soliloquizing to himself by music
after a little he opened one of the drawers took out an old music book whose leaves were yellow with age and began turning it over
there he said to miss_ophelia this was one of my mother book and here is her handwriting come and look at it
she copied and arranged this from mozart requiem miss_ophelia came accordingly it was something she used to sing often said augustine_st_clare
i think i can hear her now he struck a few majestic chords and began singing that grand old latin piece the dies iræ
tom_loker who was listening in the outer verandah was drawn by the sound to the very door where he stood earnestly
he did not understand the word of course but the music and manner of singing appeared to affect him strongly especially when augustine_st_clare sang the more pathetic part
tom_loker would have sympathized more heartily if he had known the meaning of the beautiful word recordare jesu pie quod sum causa tuær viæ
ne me perdas illa die quærens me sedisti lassus redemisti crucem passus tantus labor non sit cassus
these lines have been thus rather inadequately translated think lord_jesus for what reason thou endured st earth spite and treason nor me lose in that dread season seeking me thy worn foot hasted on the cross thy soul death tasted
augustine_st_clare threw a deep and pathetic expression into the word for the shadowy veil of year seemed drawn away and he seemed to hear his mother voice leading his
voice and instrument seemed both living and threw out with vivid sympathy those strains which the ethereal mozart first conceived as his own dying requiem
when augustine_st_clare had done singing he sat leaning his head upon his hand a few moment and then began walking up and down the floor
what a sublime conception is that of a last judgment said he a righting of all the wrongs of ages a solving of all moral problems by an unanswerable wisdom
let not all these toils be wasted mrs stowe note it is indeed a wonderful image it is a fearful one to us said miss_ophelia
i was reading to tom_loker this afternoon that chapter in matthew that gives an account of it and i have been quite struck with it
one should have expected some terrible enormities charged to those who are excluded from heaven as the reason but no they are condemned for not doing positive good as if that included every possible harm
it ought to be to me i suppose said augustine_st_clare stopping thoughtfully perhaps said miss_ophelia it is impossible for a person who does no good not to do harm
and what said augustine_st_clare speaking abstractedly but with deep feeling what shall be said of one whose own heart whose education and the wants of society have called in vain to some noble purpose who has floated on a dreamy neutral spectator of the struggles agonies and wrongs of man when he should have been a worker
i should say said miss_ophelia that he ought to repent and begin now always practical and to the point said augustine_st_clare his face breaking out into a smile
you never leave me any time for general reflections cousin you always bring me short up against the actual present you have a kind of eternal now always in your mind
now is all the time i have anything to do with said miss_ophelia dear little miss_eva poor child said augustine_st_clare she had set her little simple soul on a good work for me
it was the first time since miss_eva death that he had ever said as many word as these to her and he spoke now evidently repressing very strong feeling
my view of christianity is such he added that i think no man can consistently profess it without throwing the whole weight of his being against this monstrous system of injustice that lies at the foundation of all our society and if need be sacrificing himself in the battle
that is i mean that i could not be a christian otherwise though i have certainly had intercourse with a great many enlightened and christian people who did no such thing and i confess that the apathy of religious people on this subject their want of perception of wrongs that filled me with horror have engendered in me more scepticism than any other thing
o because i have had only that kind of benevolence which consists in lying on a sofa and cursing the church and clergy for not being martyrs and confessors
if you knew all this said miss_ophelia why didnt you do it one can see you know very easily how others ought to be martyrs
well are you going to do differently now said miss_ophelia god only knows the future said augustine_st_clare
i am braver than i was because i have lost all and he who has nothing to lose can afford all risks
my duty i hope to the poor and lowly as fast as i find it out said augustine_st_clare beginning with my own servant for whom i have yet done nothing and perhaps at some future day it may appear that i can do something for a whole class something to save my country from the disgrace of that false position in which she now stands before all civilized nations
and what are you going to do do you suppose it possible that a nation ever will voluntarily emancipate said miss_ophelia
i dont know said augustine_st_clare this is a day of great deeds heroism and disinterestedness are rising up here and there in the earth
the hungarian nobles set free millions of serfs at an immense pecuniary loss and perhaps among us may be found generous spirit who do not estimate honor and justice by dollar and cents
but suppose we should rise up tomorrow and emancipate who would educate these millions and teach them how to use their freedom
the fact is we are too lazy and unpractical ourselves ever to give them much of an idea of that industry and energy which is necessary to form them into man
they will have to go north where labor is the fashion the universal custom and tell me now is there enough christian philanthropy among your northern state to bear with the process of their education and elevation
you send thousands of dollar to foreign missions but could you endure to have the heathen sent into your towns and villages and give your time and thoughts and money to raise them to the christian standard
i hardly think so said miss_ophelia they never would rise to do much among us that what i want to know
how many family in your town would take a negro man and woman teach them bear with them and seek to make them christians
how many merchants would take mr_adolph if i wanted to make him a clerk or mechanics if i wanted him taught a trade
if i wanted to put jane and miss_rosa to a school how many schools are there in the northern state that would take them in
if we emancipate are you willing to educate how many family that would board them and yet they are as white as many a woman north or south
we are the more obvious oppressors of the negro but the unchristian prejudice of the north is an oppressor almost equally severe
well cousin i know it is so said miss_ophelia i know it was so with me till i saw that it was my duty to overcome it but
i trust i have overcome it and i know there are many good people at the north who in this matter need only to be taught what their duty is to do it
it would certainly be a greater self denial to receive heathen among us than to send missionaries to them but i think we would do it
you see cousin i want justice done us we are in a bad position you would i know said augustine_st_clare
i like to see anything you wouldnt do if you thought it your duty well i not uncommonly good said miss_ophelia
others would if they saw thing as i do i intend to take topsy home when i go i suppose our folks will wonder at first but i think they will be brought to see as i do
yes but they are a minority and if we should begin to emancipate to any extent we should soon hear from you
besides i know there are many people at the north who do exactly what you said miss_ophelia did not reply
there was a pause of some moment and augustine_st_clare countenance was overcast by a sad dreamy expression i dont know what makes me think of my mother so much tonight he said
i have a strange kind of feeling as if she were near me i keep thinking of thing she used to say
augustine_st_clare walked up and down the room for some minutes more and then said i believe i ll go down street a few moment and hear the news tonight
strange what brings these past thing so vividly back to us sometimes he took his hat and passed out tom_loker followed him to the passage out of the court and asked if he should attend him
no my boy said augustine_st_clare i shall be back in an hour tom_loker sat down in the verandah
it was a beautiful moonlight evening and he sat watching the rising and falling spray of the fountain and listening to its murmur
tom_loker thought of his home and that he should soon be a free man and able to return to it at will
he felt the muscles of his brawny arm with a sort of joy as he thought they would soon belong to himself and how much they could do to work out the freedom of his family
then he thought of his noble young master and ever second to that came the habitual prayer that he had always offered for him and then his thoughts passed on to the beautiful miss_eva whom he now thought of among the angels and he thought till he almost fancied that that bright face and golden hair were looking upon him out of the spray of the fountain
and so musing he fell asleep and dreamed he saw her coming bounding towards him just as she used to come with a wreath of jessamine in her hair her cheeks bright and her eye radiant with delight but as he looked she seemed to rise from the ground her cheeks wore a paler hue her eye had a deep divine radiance a golden halo seemed around her head and
she vanished from his sight and tom_loker was awakened by a loud knocking and a sound of many voice at the gate
he hastened to undo it and with smothered voice and heavy tread came several man bringing a body wrapped in a cloak and lying on a shutter
the light of the lamp fell full on the face and tom_loker gave a wild cry of amazement and despair that rung through all the galleries as the man advanced with their burden to the open parlor door where miss_ophelia still sat knitting
he thought how he should work to buy his wife and boy augustine_st_clare had turned into a cafe to look over an evening paper
augustine_st_clare and one or two others made an effort to separate them and augustine_st_clare received a fatal stab in the side with a bowie knife which he was attempting to wrest from one of them
the house was full of cries and lamentations shrieks and screams servant frantically tearing their hair throwing themselves on the ground or running distractedly about lamenting
as he was reading an affray arose between two gentleman in the room who were both partially intoxicated tom_loker and miss_ophelia alone seemed to have any presence of mind for marie_st_clare was in strong hysteric convulsions
at miss_ophelia direction one of the lounges in the parlor was hastily prepared and the bleeding form laid upon it
augustine_st_clare had fainted through pain and loss of blood but as miss_ophelia applied restoratives he revived opened his eye looked fixedly on them looked earnestly around the room his eye travelling wistfully over every object and finally they rested on his mother picture
it was evident from the expression of his face that there was no hope but he applied himself to dressing the wound and he and miss_ophelia and tom_loker proceeded composedly with this work amid the lamentations and sobs and cries of the affrighted servant who had clustered about the door and window of the verandah
the physician now arrived and made his examination now said the physician we must turn all these creature out all depends on his being kept quiet
augustine_st_clare opened his eye and looked fixedly on the distressed beings whom miss_ophelia and the doctor were trying to urge from the apartment
poor creature he said and an expression of bitter self reproach passed over his face mr_adolph absolutely refused to go
terror had deprived him of all presence of mind he threw himself along the floor and nothing could persuade him to rise
augustine_st_clare could say but little he lay with his eye shut but it was evident that he wrestled with bitter thoughts
the rest yielded to miss_ophelia urgent representations that their master safety depended on their stillness and obedience after a while he laid his hand on tom_loker who was kneeling beside him and said tom_loker poor fellow
what mas said tom_loker earnestly i am dying said augustine_st_clare pressing his hand pray if you would like a clergyman said the physician
and tom_loker did pray with all his mind and strength for the soul that was passing the soul that seemed looking so steadily and mournfully from those large melancholy blue eye
augustine_st_clare hastily shook his head and said again to tom_loker more earnestly pray it was literally prayer offered with strong crying and tear
he closed his eye but still retained his hold for in the gates of eternity the black hand and the white hold each other with an equal clasp
when tom_loker ceased to speak augustine_st_clare reached out and took his hand looking earnestly at him but saying nothing he murmured softly to himself at broken intervals recordare jesu
it was evident that the word he had been singing that evening were passing through his mind word of entreaty addressed to infinite pity
pie ne me perdas illa die quærens me sedisti lassus his lips moved at intervals as part of the hymn fell brokenly from them
his mind is wandering said the doctor no it is coming home at last said augustine_st_clare energetically at last
the sinking paleness of death fell on him but with it there fell as if shed from the wings of some pitying spirit a beautiful expression of peace like that of a wearied child who sleeps
at last the effort of speaking exhausted him so he lay for a few moment they saw that the mighty hand was on him
just before the spirit parted he opened his eye with a sudden light as of joy and recognition and said mother
we hear often of the distress of the negro servant on the loss of a kind master and with good reason for no creature on god earth is left more utterly unprotected and desolate than the slave in these circumstances
the child who has lost a father has still the protection of friend and of the law he is something and can do something has acknowledged rights and position the slave has none
and then he was gone chapter xxix the unprotected the law regards him in every respect as devoid of rights as a bale of merchandise
the only possible acknowledgment of any of the longings and wants of a human and immortal creature which are given to him comes to him through the sovereign and irresponsible will of his master and when that master is stricken down nothing remains
everybody knows this and the slave knows it best of all so that he feels that there are ten chances of his finding an abusive and tyrannical master to one of his finding a considerate and kind one
the number of those man who know how to use wholly irresponsible power humanely and generously is small therefore is it that the wail over a kind master is loud and long as well it may be
when augustine_st_clare breathed his last terror and consternation took hold of all his household he had been stricken down so in a moment in the flower and strength of his youth
marie_st_clare whose nervous system had been enervated by a constant course of self indulgence had nothing to support the terror of the shock and at the time her husband breathed his last was passing from one fainting fit to another and he to whom she had been joined in the mysterious tie of marriage passed from her forever without the possibility of even a parting word
miss_ophelia with characteristic strength and self control had remained with her kinsman to the last all eye all ear all attention doing everything of the little that could be done and joining with her whole soul in the tender and impassioned prayers which the poor slave had poured forth for the soul of his dying master
when they were arranging him for his last rest they found upon his bosom a small plain miniature case opening with a spring
it was the miniature of a noble and beautiful female face and on the reverse under a crystal a lock of dark hair
they laid them back on the lifeless breast dust to dust poor mournful relics of early dreams which once made that cold heart beat so warmly
tom_loker whole soul was filled with thoughts of eternity and while he ministered around the lifeless clay he did not once think that the sudden stroke had left him in hopeless slavery
he felt at peace about his master for in that hour when he had poured forth his prayer into the bosom of his father he had found an answer of quietness and assurance springing up within himself
in the depths of his own affectionate nature he felt able to perceive something of the fulness of divine love for an old oracle hath thus written he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him
every room and gallery of the house resounded with sobs and shrieks of despair tom_loker hoped and trusted and was at peace
but the funeral passed with all its pageant of black crape and prayers and solemn face and back rolled the cool muddy waves of every day life and up came the everlasting hard inquiry of what is to be done next
it rose to the mind of marie_st_clare as dressed in loose morning robes and surrounded by anxious servant she sat up in a great easy chair and inspected samples of crape and bombazine
it rose in silent terrors to the mind of the servant who well knew the unfeeling tyrannical character of the mistress in whose hand they were left
all knew very well that the indulgences which had been accorded to them were not from their mistress but from their master and that now he was gone there would be no screen between them and every tyrannous infliction which a temper soured by affliction might devise
it was about a fortnight after the funeral that miss_ophelia busied one day in her apartment heard a gentle tap at the door
she opened it and there stood miss_rosa the pretty young quadroon whom we have before often noticed her hair in disorder and her eye swelled with crying
o miss feeley she said falling on her knees and catching the skirt of her dress do do go to miss marie_st_clare for me
it rose to miss_ophelia who began to turn her thoughts towards her northern home do plead for me
it was an order written in marie_st_clare delicate italian hand to the master of a whipping establishment to give the bearer fifteen lashes
she goin to send me out to be whipped look there and she handed to miss_ophelia a paper what have you been doing said miss_ophelia
i was trying on miss marie_st_clare dress and she slapped my face and i spoke out before i thought and was saucy and
she said that she bring me down and have me know once for all that i wasnt going to be so topping as i had been and she wrote this and says i shall carry it
you know miss_feely i ve got such a bad temper it very bad of me i rather she kill me right out
you see miss_feely said miss_rosa i dont mind the whipping so much if miss marie_st_clare or you was to do it but to be sent to a man
miss_ophelia stood considering with the paper in her hand and such a horrid man the shame of it miss_feely
miss_ophelia well knew that it was the universal custom to send woman and young girl to whipping house to the hand of the lowest of man man vile enough to make this their profession there to be subjected to brutal exposure and shameful correction
she had known it before but hitherto she had never realized it till she saw the slender form of miss_rosa almost convulsed with distress
all the honest blood of womanhood the strong new england blood of liberty flushed to her cheeks and throbbed bitterly in her indignant heart but with habitual prudence and self control she mastered herself and crushing the paper firmly in her hand she merely said to miss_rosa sit down child while i go to your mistress
she found marie_st_clare sitting up in her easy chair with mammy standing by her combing her hair jane sat on the ground before her busy in chafing her foot
shameful monstrous outrageous she said to herself as she was crossing the parlor how do you find yourself today said miss_ophelia
a deep sigh and a closing of the eye was the only reply for a moment and then marie_st_clare answered i dont know cousin i suppose i as well as i ever shall be and marie_st_clare wiped her eye with a cambric handkerchief bordered with an inch deep of black
i came said miss_ophelia with a short dry cough such as commonly introduces a difficult subject i came to speak with you about poor miss_rosa
marie_st_clare eye were open wide enough now and a flush rose to her sallow cheeks as she answered sharply well what about her
she is very sorry for her fault she is is she she ll be sorrier before i ve done with her
i ve endured that child impudence long enough and now i ll bring her down i ll make her lie in the dust but could not you punish her some other way some way that would be less shameful
she has all her life presumed on her delicacy and her good looks and her lady like air till she forgets who she is and
i mean to shame her that just what i want i ll give her one lesson that will bring her down
but cousin consider that if you destroy delicacy and a sense of shame in a young girl you deprave her very fast
i fancy delicacy said marie_st_clare with a scornful laugh a fine word for such as she i ll teach her with all her air that she no better than the raggedest black wench that walks the streets
she ll take no more air with me you will answer to god for such cruelty said miss_ophelia with energy
cruelty i like to know what the cruelty is i wrote orders for only fifteen lashes and told him to put them on lightly
i sure there no cruelty there no cruelty said miss_ophelia i sure any girl might rather be killed outright
it might seem so to anybody with your feeling but all these creature get used to it it the only way they can be kept in order
once let them feel that they are to take any air about delicacy and all that and they ll run all over you just as my servant always have
i ve begun now to bring them under and i ll have them all to know that i ll send one out to be whipped as soon as another if they dont mind themselves said marie_st_clare looking around her decidedly
jane hung her head and cowered at this for she felt as if it was particularly directed to her miss_ophelia sat for a moment as if she had swallowed some explosive mixture and were ready to burst
then recollecting the utter uselessness of contention with such a nature she shut her lips resolutely gathered herself up and walked out of the room
it was hard to go back and tell miss_rosa that she could do nothing for her and shortly after one of the man servant came to say that her mistress had ordered him to take miss_rosa with him to the whipping house whither she was hurried in spite of her tear and entreaties
a few day after tom_loker was standing musing by the balconies when he was joined by mr_adolph who since the death of his master had been entirely crest fallen and disconsolate
mr_adolph knew that he had always been an object of dislike to marie_st_clare but while his master lived he had paid but little attention to it
now that he was gone he had moved about in daily dread and trembling not knowing what might befall him next
marie_st_clare had held several consultations with her lawyer after communicating with augustine_st_clare brother it was determined to sell the place and all the servant except her own personal property and these she intended to take with her and go back to her father plantation
do ye know tom_loker that we ve all got to be sold said mr_adolph how did you hear that said tom_loker
i hid myself behind the curtains when missis was talking with the lawyer in a few day we shall be sent off to auction tom_loker
we ll never get another such a master said mr_adolph apprehensively but i rather be sold than take my chance under missis
the lord will be done said tom_loker folding his arm and sighing heavily tom_loker turned away his heart was full
the hope of liberty the thought of distant wife and child rose up before his patient soul as to the mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises the vision of the church spire and loving roofs of his native village seen over the top of some black wave only for one last farewell
the poor old soul had such a singular unaccountable prejudice in favor of liberty that it was a hard wrench for him and the more he said thy will be done the worse he felt
he drew his arm tightly over his bosom and choked back the bitter tear and tried to pray he sought miss_ophelia who ever since miss_eva death had treated him with marked and respectful kindness
he told me that he had begun to take it out for me and now perhaps if miss_feely would be good enough to speak bout it to missis she would feel like goin on with it was it as
miss_feely he said mas augustine_st_clare promised me my freedom mas augustine_st_clare wish i ll speak for you tom_loker and do my best said miss_ophelia
but if it depends on mrs augustine_st_clare i cant hope much for you nevertheless i will try this incident occurred a few day after that of miss_rosa while miss_ophelia was busied in preparations to return north
seriously reflecting within herself she considered that perhaps she had shown too hasty a warmth of language in her former interview with marie_st_clare and she resolved that she would now endeavor to moderate her zeal and to be as conciliatory as possible
so the good soul gathered herself up and taking her knitting resolved to go into marie_st_clare room be as agreeable as possible and negotiate tom_loker case with all the diplomatic skill of which she was mistress
she found marie_st_clare reclining at length upon a lounge supporting herself on one elbow by pillows while jane who had been out shopping was displaying before her certain samples of thin black stuffs
law missis said jane volubly mrs general derbennon wore just this very thing after the general died last summer it makes up lovely
that will do said marie_st_clare selecting one only i not sure about its being properly mourning what do you think said marie_st_clare to miss_ophelia
the fact is said marie_st_clare that i havent a dress in the world that i can wear and as i am going to break up the establishment and go off
it a matter of custom i suppose said miss_ophelia you can judge about it better than i next week i must decide upon something
augustine_st_clare brother has written and he and the lawyer think that the servant and furniture had better be put up at auction and the place left with our lawyer
are you going so soon yes there one thing i wanted to speak with you about said miss_ophelia
augustine_st_clare promised tom_loker his liberty and began the legal form necessary to it i hope you will use your influence to have it perfected
indeed i shall do no such thing said marie_st_clare sharply tom_loker is one of the most valuable servant on the place it couldnt be afforded any way
besides what does he want of liberty he a great deal better off as he is but he does desire it very earnestly and his master promised it said miss_ophelia
i dare say he does want it said marie_st_clare they all want it just because they are a discontented set always wanting what they havent got
keep a negro under the care of a master and he does well enough and is respectable but set them free and they get lazy and wont work and take to drinking and go all down to be mean worthless fellow i ve seen it tried hundreds of time
now i principled against emancipating in any case it no favor to set them free but tom_loker is so steady industrious and pious
you neednt tell me i ve see a hundred like him he ll do very well as long as he taken care
but then consider said miss_ophelia when you set him up for sale the chances of his getting a bad master
that all humbug said marie_st_clare it isnt one time in a hundred that a good fellow gets a bad master most master are good for all the talk that is made
i ve lived and grown up here in the south and i never yet was acquainted with a master that didnt treat his servant well quite as well as is worth while
well said miss_ophelia energetically i know it was one of the last wishes of your husband that tom_loker should have his liberty
it was one of the promises that he made to dear little miss_eva on her death bed and i should not think you would feel at liberty to disregard it
marie_st_clare had her face covered with her handkerchief at this appeal and began sobbing and using her smelling bottle with great vehemence
of that all i dont feel any fears on that head everybody goes against me she said
everybody is so inconsiderate i shouldnt have expected that you would bring up all these remembrances of my troubles to me it so inconsiderate
but nobody ever does consider my trials are so peculiar it so hard that when i had only one daughter she should have been taken and when i had a husband
that just exactly suited me and i so hard to be suited he should be taken and you seem to have so little feeling for me and keep bringing it up to me
and marie_st_clare sobbed and gasped for breath and called mammy to open the window and to bring her the camphor bottle and to bathe her head and unhook her dress
so carelessly when you know how it overcomes me i suppose you mean well but it is very inconsiderate very and in the general confusion that ensued miss_ophelia made her escape to her apartment
she saw at once that it would do no good to say anything more for marie_st_clare had an indefinite capacity for hysteric fits and after this whenever her husband or miss_eva wishes with regard to the servant were alluded to she always found it convenient to set one in operation
miss_ophelia therefore did the next best thing she could for tom_loker she wrote a letter to mrs mr_shelby for him stating his troubles and urging them to send to his relief
the next day tom_loker and mr_adolph and some half a dozen other servant were marched down to a slave warehouse to await the convenience of the trader who was going to make up a lot for auction
chapter xxx the slave warehouse a slave warehouse perhaps some of my readers conjure up horrible visions of such a place
but no innocent friend in these day man have learned the art of sinning expertly and genteelly so as not to shock the eye and senses of respectable society
human property is high in the market and is therefore well fed well cleaned tended and looked after that it may come to sale sleek and strong and shining
a slave warehouse in new orleans is a house externally not much unlike many others kept with neatness and where every day you may see arranged under a sort of shed along the outside rows of man and woman who stand there as a sign of the property sold within
then you shall be courteously entreated to call and examine and shall find an abundance of husband wife brothers sisters father mother and young child to be sold separately or in lots to suit the convenience of the purchaser and that soul immortal once bought with blood and anguish by the son of god when the earth shook and the rocks rent and the graves were opened can be sold leased mortgaged exchanged for groceries or dry goods to suit the phases of trade or the fancy of the purchaser
it was a day or two after the conversation between marie_st_clare and miss_ophelia that tom_loker mr_adolph and about half a dozen others of the augustine_st_clare estate were turned over to the loving kindness of mr skeggs the keeper of a depot on street to await the auction next day
they fancy some foul obscure den some horrible tartarus informis ingens cui lumen ademptum tom_loker had with him quite a sizable trunk full of clothing as had most others of them
they were ushered for the night into a long room where many other man of all ages sizes and shades of complexion were assembled and from which roars of laughter and unthinking merriment were proceeding
ah ha that right go it boy go it said mr skeggs the keeper my people are always so merry
he said speaking approvingly to a burly negro who was performing tricks of low buffoonery which occasioned the shouts which tom_loker had heard
as might be imagined tom_loker was in no humor to join these proceedings and therefore setting his trunk as far as possible from the noisy group he sat down on it and leaned his face against the wall
the dealers in the human article make scrupulous and systematic efforts to promote noisy mirth among them as a means of drowning reflection and rendering them insensible to their condition
the whole object of the training to which the negro is put from the time he is sold in the northern market till he arrives south is systematically directed towards making him callous unthinking and brutal
the slave dealer collects his gang in virginia or kentucky and drives them to some convenient healthy place often a watering place to be fattened
here they are fed full daily and because some incline to pine a fiddle is kept commonly going among them and they are made to dance daily and he who refuses to be merry in whose soul thoughts of wife or child or home are too strong for him to be gay is marked as sullen and dangerous and subjected to all the evils which the ill will of an utterly irresponsible and hardened man can inflict upon him
briskness alertness and cheerfulness of appearance especially before observers are constantly enforced upon them both by the hope of thereby getting a good master and the fear of all that the driver may bring upon them if they prove unsalable
sambo i see what dat ar nigger doin here said sambo coming up to tom_loker after mr skeggs had left the room
sambo was a full black of great size very lively voluble and full of trick and grimace what you doin here said sambo coming up to tom_loker and poking him facetiously in the side
meditatin eh i am to be sold at the auction tomorrow said tom_loker quietly sold at auction haw haw boy ant this yer fun
i wisht i was gwine that ar way tell ye wouldnt i make em laugh but how is it dis yer whole lot gwine tomorrow said sambo laying his hand freely on mr_adolph shoulder

he do for a tobaccer shop they could keep him to scent snuff lor he keep a whole shope agwine he would i say keep off cant you
said mr_adolph enraged lor now how touchy we is we white nigger look at us now and sambo gave a ludicrous imitation of mr_adolph manner here de air and graces
we been in a good family i specs yes said mr_adolph i had a master that could have bought you all for old truck
law now only think said sambo the gentlemens that we is i belonged to the augustine_st_clare family said mr_adolph proudly
spects they gwine to trade ye off with a lot cracked tea pots and sich like said sambo with a provoking grin
lor you did be hanged if they ar nt lucky to get shet of ye mr_adolph enraged at this taunt flew furiously at his adversary swearing and striking on every side of him
the rest laughed and shouted and the uproar brought the keeper to the door what now boy order order he said coming in and flourishing a large whip
all fled in different directions except sambo who presuming on the favor which the keeper had to him as a licensed wag stood his ground ducking his head with a facetious grin whenever the master made a dive at him
lor mas tant us we reglar stiddy it these yer new hand they real aggravatin kinder pickin at us all time
the keeper at this turned upon tom_loker and mr_adolph and distributing a few kicks and cuffs without much inquiry and leaving general orders for all to be good boy and go to sleep left the apartment
while this scene was going on in the man sleeping room the reader may be curious to take a peep at the corresponding apartment allotted to the woman
stretched out in various attitudes over the floor he may see numberless sleeping form of every shade of complexion from the purest ebony to white and of all year from childhood to old age lying now asleep
here is a fine bright girl of ten year whose mother was sold out yesterday and who tonight cried herself to sleep when nobody was looking at her
here a worn old negress whose thin arm and callous fingers tell of hard toil waiting to be sold tomorrow as a cast off article for what can be got for her and some forty or fifty others with head variously enveloped in blankets or articles of clothing lie stretched around them
one of these is a respectably dressed mulatto woman between forty and fifty with soft eye and a gentle and pleasing physiognomy
she has on her head a high raised turban made of a gay red madras handkerchief of the first quality her dress is neatly fitted and of good material showing that she has been provided for with a careful hand
but in a corner sitting apart from the rest are two females of a more interesting appearance than common by her side and nestling closely to her is a young girl of fifteen her daughter
she is a quadroon as may be seen from her fairer complexion though her likeness to her mother is quite discernible
she has the same soft dark eye with longer lashes and her curling hair is of a luxuriant brown she also is dressed with great neatness and her white delicate hand betray very little acquaintance with servile toil
these two are to be sold tomorrow in the same lot with the augustine_st_clare servant and the gentleman to whom they belong and to whom the money for their sale is to be transmitted is a member of a christian church in new york who will receive the money and go thereafter to the sacrament of his lord and theirs and think no more of it
these two whom we shall call susan and emmeline had been the personal attendants of an amiable and pious lady of new orleans by whom they had been carefully and piously instructed and trained
they had been taught to read and write diligently instructed in the truths of religion and their lot had been as happy an one as in their condition
but the only son of their protectress had the management of her property and by carelessness and extravagance involved it to a large amount and at last failed
it was possible to be one of the largest creditors was the respectable firm of co in new york
b co wrote to their lawyer in new orleans who attached the real estate these two articles and a lot of plantation hand formed the most valuable part of it and wrote word to that effect to new york
brother being as we have said a christian man and a resident in a free state felt some uneasiness on the subject
but then there were thirty thousand dollar in the case and that was rather too much money to be lost for a principle and so after much considering and asking advice from those that he knew would advise to suit him brother wrote to his lawyer to dispose of the business in the way that seemed to him the most suitable and remit the proceeds
the day after the letter arrived in new orleans susan and emmeline were attached and sent to the depot to await a general auction on the following morning and as they glimmer faintly upon us in the moonlight which steals through the grated window we may listen to their conversation
he didnt like trading in slave and soul of man of course he didnt both are weeping but each quietly that the other may not hear
mother just lay your head on my lap and see if you cant sleep a little says the girl trying to appear calm
i havent any heart to sleep em i cant it the last night we may be together mother dont say so
perhaps we shall get sold together who knows ift was anybody else case i should say so too em said the woman
but i so feard of losin you that i dont see anything but the danger why mother the man said we were both likely and would sell well
with a deadly sickness at her heart she remembered how he had looked at emmeline hand and lifted up her curly hair and pronounced her a first rate article
susan had been trained as a christian brought up in the daily reading of the bible and had the same horror of her child being sold to a life of shame that any other christian mother might have but she had no hope no protection
mother i think we might do first rate if you could get a place as cook and i as chambermaid or seamstress in some family
let both look as bright and lively as we can and tell all we can do and perhaps we shall said emmeline
susan remembered the man looks and word i dare say we shall i want you to brush your hair all back straight tomorrow said susan
what for mother i dont look near so well that way yes but you ll sell better so i dont see why said the child
respectable family would be more apt to buy you if they saw you looked plain and decent as if you wasnt trying to look handsome
and emmeline if we shouldnt ever see each other again after tomorrow if i sold way up on a plantation somewhere and you somewhere else always remember how you ve been brought up and all missis has told you take your bible with you and your hymn book and if you re faithful to the lord he ll be faithful to you
so speaks the poor soul in sore discouragement for she knows that tomorrow any man however vile and brutal however godless and merciless if he only has money to pay for her may become owner of her daughter body and soul and then how is the child to be faithful
she thinks of all this as she holds her daughter in her arm and wishes that she were not handsome and attractive
it seems almost an aggravation to her to remember how purely and piously how much above the ordinary lot she has been brought up
but she has no resort but to pray and many such prayers to god have gone up from those same trim neatly arranged respectable slave prisons prayers which god has not forgotten as a coming day shall show for it is written
who causeth one of these little one to offend it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depths of the sea
i know their way better you do said susan well mother then i will
the soft earnest quiet moonbeam looks in fixedly marking the bars of the grated window on the prostrate sleeping form the mother and daughter are singing together a wild and melancholy dirge common as a funeral hymn among the slave
where is weeping mary where is weeping mary rived in the goodly land she is dead and gone to heaven she is dead and gone to heaven rived in the goodly land
these word sung by voice of a peculiar and melancholy sweetness in an air which seemed like the sighing of earthy despair after heavenly hope floated through the dark prison room with a pathetic cadence as verse after verse was breathed out where are paul and silas
where are paul and silas gone to the goodly land they are dead and gone to heaven they are dead and gone to heaven rived in the goodly land
but now it is morning and everybody is astir and the worthy mr skeggs is busy and bright for a lot of goods is to be fitted out for auction
there is a brisk lookout on the toilet injunctions passed around to every one to put on their best face and be spry and now all are arranged in a circle for a last review before they are marched up to the bourse
mr skeggs with his palmetto on and his cigar in his mouth walks around to put farewell touches on his wares
sing on poor soul the night is short and the morning will part you forever how this he said stepping in front of susan and emmeline
the girl looked timidly at her mother who with the smooth adroitness common among her class answers i was telling her last night to put up her hair smooth and neat and not havin it flying about in curls looks more respectable so
where your curls gal bother said the man peremptorily turning to the girl you go right along and curl yourself real smart
he added giving a crack to a rattan he held in his hand and be back in quick time too
you go and help her he added to the mother them curls may make a hundred dollar difference in the sale of her
beneath a splendid dome were man of all nations moving to and fro over the marble pave on every side of the circular area were little tribunes or stations for the use of speakers and auctioneers
two of these on opposite side of the area were now occupied by brilliant and talented gentleman enthusiastically forcing up in english and french commingled the bids of connoisseurs in their various wares
a third one on the other side still unoccupied was surrounded by a group waiting the moment of sale to begin
and here we may recognize the augustine_st_clare servant tom_loker mr_adolph and others and there too susan and emmeline awaiting their turn with anxious and dejected face
various spectators intending to purchase or not intending examining and commenting on their various points and face with the same freedom that a set of jockeys discuss the merits of a horse
hulloa alf what brings you here said a young exquisite slapping the shoulder of a sprucely dressed young man who was examining mr_adolph through an eye glass
well i was wanting a valet and i heard that augustine_st_clare lot was going i thought i just look at his
catch me ever buying any of augustine_st_clare people spoilt nigger every one impudent as the devil said the other
if i get em i ll soon have their air out of them they ll soon find that they ve another kind of master to deal with than monsieur augustine_st_clare
never fear that said the first pon my word i ll buy that fellow i like the shape of him you ll find it ll take all you ve got to keep him
he deucedly extravagant yes but my lord will find that he cant be extravagant with me just let him be sent to the calaboose a few time and thoroughly dressed down
i ll tell you if it dont bring him to a sense of his way i ll reform him up hill and down you ll see
tom_loker had been standing wistfully examining the multitude of face thronging around him for one whom he would wish to call master
and if you should ever be under the necessity sir of selecting out of two hundred man one who was to become your absolute owner and disposer you would perhaps realize just as tom_loker did how few there were that you would feel at all comfortable in being made over to
tom_loker saw abundance of man great burly gruff man little chirping dried man long favored lank hard man and every variety of stubbed looking commonplace man who pick up their fellow man as one picks up chips putting them into the fire or a basket with equal unconcern according to their convenience but he saw no augustine_st_clare
a little before the sale commenced a short broad muscular man in a checked shirt considerably open at the bosom and pantaloons much the worse for dirt and wear elbowed his way through the crowd like one who is going actively into a business and coming up to the group began to examine them systematically
from the moment that tom_loker saw him approaching he felt an immediate and revolting horror at him that increased as he came near
his round bullet head large light gray eye with their shaggy sandy eyebrows and stiff wiry sun burned hair were rather unprepossessing items it is to be confessed his large coarse mouth was distended with tobacco the juice of which from time to time he ejected from him with great decision and explosive force his hand were immensely large hairy sun burned freckled and very dirty and garnished with long nails in a very foul condition
i buy him that flat he was evidently though short of gigantic strength this man proceeded to a very free personal examination of the lot
he seized tom_loker by the jaw and pulled open his mouth to inspect his teeth made him strip up his sleeve to show his muscle turned him round made him jump and spring to show his paces
where was you raised he added briefly to these investigations in kintuck mas said tom_loker looking about as if for deliverance
what have you done had care of mas s farm said tom_loker likely story said the other shortly as he passed on
he paused a moment before dolph then spitting a discharge of tobacco juice on his well blacked boots and giving a contemptuous umph he walked on
he put out his heavy dirty hand and drew the girl towards him passed it over her neck and bust felt her arm looked at her teeth and then pushed her back against her mother whose patient face showed the suffering she had been going through at every motion of the hideous stranger
again he stopped before susan and emmeline the girl was frightened and began to cry stop that you minx said the salesman no whimpering here the sale is going to begin
mr_adolph was knocked off at a good sum to the young gentleman who had previously stated his intention of buying him and the other servant of the augustine_st_clare lot went to various bidders
tom_loker stepped upon the block gave a few anxious looks round all seemed mingled in a common indistinct noise the clatter of the salesman crying off his qualifications in french and english the quick fire of french and english bids and almost in a moment came the final thump of the hammer and the clear ring on the last syllable of the word dollar as the auctioneer announced his price and tom_loker was made over he had a master
he was pushed from the block the short bullet headed man seizing him roughly by the shoulder pushed him to one side saying in a harsh voice stand there you
and accordingly the sale begun now up with you boy ye hear said the auctioneer to tom_loker tom hardly realized anything but still the bidding went on ratting clattering now french now english
down goes the hammer again susan is sold she goes down from the block stops looks wistfully back her daughter stretches her hand towards her
she looks with agony in the face of the man who has bought her a respectable middle aged man of benevolent countenance
i like to but i afraid i cant afford it said the gentleman looking with painful interest as the young girl mounted the block and looked around her with a frightened and timid glance
the blood flushes painfully in her otherwise colorless cheek her eye has a feverish fire and her mother groans to see that she looks more beautiful than she ever saw her before
o mas please do buy my daughter the auctioneer sees his advantage and expatiates volubly in mingled french and english and bids rise in rapid succession
i ll do anything in reason said the benevolent looking gentleman pressing in and joining with the bids in a few moment they have run beyond his purse
he is silent the auctioneer grows warmer but bids gradually drop off it lies now between an aristocratic old citizen and our bullet headed acquaintance
the citizen bids for a few turns contemptuously measuring his opponent but the bullet head has the advantage over him both in obstinacy and concealed length of purse and the controversy lasts but a moment the hammer falls he has got the girl body and soul unless god help her
she is pushed along into the same lot with tom_loker and two other man and goes off weeping as she goes
her master is mr simon_legree who owns a cotton plantation on the red river the benevolent gentleman is sorry but then the thing happens every day
one sees girl and mother crying at these sales always it cant be helped and he walks off with his acquisition in another direction
two day after the lawyer of the christian firm of co new york send on their money to them
on the reverse of that draft so obtained let them write these word of the great paymaster to whom they shall make up their account in a future day when he maketh inquisition for blood he forgetteth not the cry of the humble
thou art of purer eye than to behold evil and canst not look upon iniquity wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherously and holdest thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he hab
on the lower part of a small mean boat on the red river tom_loker sat chains on his wrists chains on his foot and a weight heavier than chains lay on his heart
all had faded from his sky moon and star all had passed by him as the trees and banks were now passing to return no more
kentucky home with wife and child and indulgent owners augustine_st_clare home with all its refinements and splendors the golden head of miss_eva with its saint like eye the proud gay handsome seemingly careless yet ever kind augustine_st_clare hour of ease and indulgent leisure all gone
it is one of the bitterest apportionments of a lot of slavery that the negro sympathetic and assimilative after acquiring in a refined family the tastes and feeling which form the atmosphere of such a place is not the less liable to become the bond slave of the coarsest and most brutal just as a chair or table which once decorated the superb saloon comes at last battered and defaced to the barroom of some filthy tavern or some low haunt of vulgar debauchery
the great difference is that the table and chair cannot feel and the man can for even a legal enactment that he shall be taken reputed adjudged in law to be a chattel personal cannot blot out his soul with its own private little world of memories hopes love fears and desires
mr simon_legree tom_loker master had purchased slave at one place and another in new orleans to the number of eight and driven them handcuffed in couples of two and two down to the good steamer pirate which lay at the levee ready for a trip up the red river
having got them fairly on board and the boat being off he came round with that air of efficiency which ever characterized him to take a review of them
stopping opposite to tom_loker who had been attired for sale in his best broadcloth suit with well starched linen and shining boots he briefly expressed himself as follows stand up
take off that stock and as tom_loker encumbered by his fetters proceeded to do it he assisted him by pulling it with no gentle hand from his neck and putting it in his pocket
simon_legree now turned to tom_loker trunk which previous to this he had been ransacking and taking from it a pair of old pantaloons and dilapidated coat which tom_loker had been wont to put on about his stable work he said liberating tom_loker hand from the handcuffs and pointing to a recess in among the boxes you go there and put these on
chapter xxxi the middle passage and in place thereof what remains tom_loker stood up tom_loker obeyed and in a few moment returned
there said the former throwing him a pair of coarse stout shoes such as were common among the slave put these on
take off your boots said mr simon_legree tom_loker did so in tom_loker hurried exchange he had not forgotten to transfer his cherished bible to his pocket
it was well he did so for mr simon_legree having refitted tom_loker handcuffs proceeded deliberately to investigate the contents of his pocket
several little trifles which tom_loker had treasured chiefly because they had amused miss_eva he looked upon with a contemptuous grunt and tossed them over his shoulder into the river
he drew out a silk handkerchief and put it into his own pocket tom_loker methodist hymn book which in his hurry he had forgotten
he now held up and turned over humph pious to be sure so what yer name you belong to the church eh
yes mas said tom_loker firmly well i ll soon have that out of you i have none yer bawling praying singing nigger on my place so remember
now mind yourself he said with a stamp and a fierce glance of his gray eye directed at tom_loker i your church now
and as if repeated by an invisible voice came the word of an old prophetic scroll as miss_eva had often read them to him fear not
you understand you ve got to be as i say something within the silent black man answered no for i have redeemed thee
i have called thee by name thou art mine but simon_legree heard no voice that voice is one he never shall hear
he took tom_loker trunk which contained a very neat and abundant wardrobe to the forecastle where it was soon surrounded by various hand of the boat
with much laughing at the expense of nigger who tried to be gentleman the articles very readily were sold to one and another and the empty trunk finally put up at auction
it was a good joke they all thought especially to see how tom_loker looked after his thing as they were going this way and that and then the auction of the trunk that was funnier than all and occasioned abundant witticisms
he only glared for a moment on the downcast face of tom_loker and walked off this little affair being over simon_legree sauntered up again to his property
now tom_loker i ve relieved you of any extra baggage you see take mighty good care of them clothes it ll be long enough fore you get more
i go in for making nigger careful one suit has to do for one year on my place simon_legree next walked up to the place where emmeline was sitting chained to another woman
well my dear he said chucking her under the chin keep up your spirit the involuntary look of horror fright and aversion with which the girl regarded him did not escape his eye
he frowned fiercely none your shines gal you got to keep a pleasant face when i speak to ye ye hear
he said giving a shove to the mulatto woman to whom emmeline was chained dont you carry that sort of face
i say all on ye he said retreating a pace or two back look at me look at me look me right in the eye straight now said he stamping his foot at every pause
and you you old yellow poco moonshine you got to look chipper i tell ye as by a fascination every eye was now directed to the glaring greenish gray eye of simon_legree
now said he doubling his great heavy fist into something resembling a blacksmith hammer ye see this fist heft it
he said bringing it down on tom_loker hand look at these yer bones well i tell ye this yer fist has got as hard as iron knocking down nigger
i never see the nigger yet i couldnt bring down with one crack said he bringing his fist down so near to the face of tom_loker that he winked and drew back
i dont keep none yer cussed overseers i does my own overseeing and i tell you thing is seen to
you every one on ye got to toe the mark i tell ye quick straight the moment i speak that the way to keep in with me
ye wont find no soft spot in me nowhere so now mind yerselves for i dont show no mercy the woman involuntarily drew in their breath and the whole gang sat with downcast dejected face
that the way i begin with my nigger he said to a gentlemanly man who had stood by him during his speech
meanwhile simon_legree turned on his heel and marched up to the bar of the boat for a dram it my system to begin strong just
let em know what to expect indeed said the stranger looking upon him with the curiosity of a naturalist studying some out of the way specimen
i none yer gentleman planters with lily fingers to slop round and be cheated by some old cuss of an overseer
yes indeed just feel of my knuckles now look at my fist tell ye sir the flesh ont has come jest like a stone practising on nigger feel on it
the stranger applied his fingers to the implement in question and simply saidt is hard enough and i suppose he added practice has made your heart just like it
why yes i may say so said simon_legree with a hearty laugh i reckon there as little soft in me as in any one going
tell you nobody comes it over me nigger never gets round me neither with squalling nor soft soap that a fact
i paid a little high for him tendin him for a driver and a managing chap only get the notions out that he larnt by bein treated as nigger never ought to be he ll do prime
you have a fine lot there real said simon_legree there that tom_loker they telled me he was suthin uncommon the yellow woman i got took in on
i rayther think she sickly but i shall put her through for what she worth she may last a year or two
use up and buy more my way makes you less trouble and i quite sure it comes cheaper in the end and simon_legree sipped his glass
i dont go for savin nigger and how long do they generally last said the stranger well donno cordin as their constitution is
i used to when i fust begun have considerable trouble fussin with em and trying to make em hold out doctorin on em up when they sick and givin on em clothes and blankets and what not tryin to keep em all sort decent and comfortable
stout fellers last six or seven year trashy one gets worked up in two or three lawt wasnt no sort use i lost money on em andt was heaps trouble
now you see i just put em straight through sick or well when one nigger dead i buy another and i find it comes cheaper and easier every way
the stranger turned away and seated himself beside a gentleman who had been listening to the conversation with repressed uneasiness
you must not take that fellow to be any specimen of southern planters said he i should hope not said the young gentleman with emphasis
and yet your law allow him to hold any number of human beings subject to his absolute will without even a shadow of protection and low as he is you cannot say that there are not many such
he is a mean low brutal fellow said the other well said the other there are also many considerate and humane man among planters
but in my opinion it is you considerate humane man that are responsible for all the brutality and outrage wrought by these wretches because if it were not for your sanction and influence the whole system could not keep foothold for an hour
if there were no planters except such as that one said he pointing with his finger to simon_legree who stood with his back to them the whole thing would go down like a millstone
you certainly have a high opinion of my good nature said the planter smiling but i advise you not to talk quite so loud as there are people on board the boat who might not be quite so tolerant to opinion as i am
you had better wait till i get up to my plantation and there you may abuse us all quite at your leisure
granted said the young man it is your respectability and humanity that licenses and protects his brutality the young gentleman colored and smiled and the two were soon busy in a game of backgammon
meanwhile another conversation was going on in the lower part of the boat between emmeline and the mulatto woman with whom she was confined
as was natural they were exchanging with each other some particulars of their history who did you belong to said emmeline
well my mas was mr ellis lived on levee street raps you ve seen the house was he good to you said emmeline
mostly till he tuk sick he lain sick off and on more than six months and been orful oneasy
pears like he warnt willin to have nobody rest day or night and got so curous there couldnt nobody suit him
pears like he just grew crosser every day kep me up night till i got farly beat out and couldnt keep awake no longer and cause i got to sleep one night lors he talk so orful to me and he tell me he sell me to just the hardest master he could find and he promised me my freedom too when he died
had you any friend said emmeline yes my husband he a blacksmith mas gen ly hired him out they took me off so quick i didnt even have time to see him and i got four child
it is a natural impulse in every one when they hear a tale of distress to think of something to say by way of consolation
o dear me said the woman covering her face with her hand emmeline wanted to say something but she could not think of anything to say
as by a common consent they both avoided with fear and dread all mention of the horrible man who was now their master
what was there to be said true there is religious trust for even the darkest hour the mulatto woman was a member of the methodist church and had an unenlightened but very sincere spirit of piety
emmeline had been educated much more intelligently taught to read and write and diligently instructed in the bible by the care of a faithful and pious mistress yet would it not try the faith of the firmest christian to find themselves abandoned apparently of god in the grasp of ruthless violence
the boat moved on freighted with its weight of sorrow up the red muddy turbid current through the abrupt tortuous windings of the red river and sad eye gazed wearily on the steep red clay banks as they glided by in dreary sameness
how much more must it shake the faith of jesus_christ poor little one weak in knowledge and tender in year at last the boat stopped at a small town and simon_legree with his party disembarked
chapter xxxii dark place the dark place of the earth are full of the habitations of cruelty ps
in the wagon was seated simon_legree and the two woman still fettered together were stowed away with some baggage in the back part of it and the whole company were seeking simon_legree plantation which lay a good distance off
it was a wild forsaken road now winding through dreary pine barrens where the wind whispered mournfully and now over log causeways through long cypress swamps the doleful trees rising out of the slimy spongy ground hung with long wreaths of funeral black moss while ever and anon the loathsome form of the mocassin snake might be seen sliding among broken stumps and shattered branches that lay here and there rotting in the water
it is disconsolate enough this riding to the stranger who with well filled pocket and well appointed horse threads the lonely way on some errand of business but wilder drearier to the man enthralled whom every weary step bears further from all that man love and prays for
so one should have thought that witnessed the sunken and dejected expression on those dark face the wistful patient weariness with which those sad eye rested on object after object that passed them in their sad journey
simon_legree rode on however apparently well pleased occasionally pulling away at a flask of spirit which he kept in his pocket
trailing wearily behind a rude wagon and over a ruder road tom_loker and his associates faced onward i say you he said as he turned back and caught a glance at the dispirited face behind him
the man looked at each other and the come was repeated with a smart crack of the whip which the driver carried in his hand
strike up a song boy come tom_loker began a methodist hymn jerusalem my happy home name ever dear to me
jerusalem my happy home anonymous hymn dating from the latter part of the sixteenth century sung to the tune of st stephen
when shall my sorrows have an end thy joys when shall word derive from st augustine_st_clare meditations
shut up you black cuss roared simon_legree did ye think i wanted any yer infernal old methodism i say tune up now something real rowdy quick
one of the other man struck up one of those unmeaning songs common among the slave mas see me cotch a coon high boy high
the singer appeared to make up the song to his own pleasure generally hitting on rhyme without much attempt at reason and the party took up the chorus at intervals ho
he laughed to split ye see the moon ho ho ho boy ho ho yo hi oh ho ho boy ho high
it was sung very boisterouly and with a forced attempt at merriment but no wail of despair no word of impassioned prayer could have had such a depth of woe in them as the wild notes of the chorus
as if the poor dumb heart threatened prisoned took refuge in that inarticulate sanctuary of music and found there a language in which to breathe its prayer to god
e oh high oh there was a prayer in it which simon_legree could not hear he only heard the boy singing noisily and was well pleased he was making them keep up their spirit
well my little dear said he turning to emmeline and laying his hand on her shoulder we re almost home
when simon_legree scolded and stormed emmeline was terrified but when he laid his hand on her and spoke as he now did she felt as if she had rather he would strike her
the expression of his eye made her soul sick and her flesh creep involuntarily she clung closer to the mulatto woman by her side as if she were her mother
you didnt ever wear ear rings he said taking hold of her small ear with his coarse fingers no mas
said emmeline trembling and looking down well i ll give you a pair when we get home if you re a good girl
you neednt be so frightened i dont mean to make you work very hard you ll have fine time with me and live like
simon_legree had been drinking to that degree that he was inclining to be very gracious and it was about this time that the enclosures of the plantation rose to view
the estate had formerly belonged to a gentleman of opulence and taste who had bestowed some considerable attention to the adornment of his grounds
having died insolvent it had been purchased at a bargain by simon_legree who used it as he did everything else merely as an implement for money making
the place had that ragged forlorn appearance which is always produced by the evidence that the care of the former owner has been left to go to utter decay
what was once a smooth shaven lawn before the house dotted here and there with ornamental shrubs was now covered with frowsy tangled grass with horseposts set up here and there in it where the turf was stamped away and the ground littered with broken pails cobs of corn and other slovenly remains
here and there a mildewed jessamine or honeysuckle hung raggedly from some ornamental support which had been pushed to one side by being used as a horse post
what once was a large garden was now all grown over with weeds through which here and there some solitary exotic reared its forsaken head
what had been a conservatory had now no window shades and on the mouldering shelves stood some dry forsaken flower pots with sticks in them whose dried leaves showed they had once been plants
the wagon rolled up a weedy gravel walk under a noble avenue of china trees whose graceful form and ever springing foliage seemed to be the only thing there that neglect could not daunt or alter like noble spirit so deeply rooted in goodness as to flourish and grow stronger amid discouragement and decay
it was built in a manner common at the south a wide verandah of two stories running round every part of the house into which every outer door opened the lower tier being supported by brick pillars
but the place looked desolate and uncomfortable some window stopped up with boards some with shattered panes and shutters hanging by a single hinge all telling of coarse neglect and discomfort
bits of board straw old decayed barrels and boxes garnished the ground in all directions and three or four ferocious looking dog roused by the sound of the wagon wheels came tearing out and were with difficulty restrained from laying hold of tom_loker and his companions by the effort of the ragged servant who came after them
a lady only be a good girl the house had been large and handsome ye see what ye get said simon_legree caressing the dog with grim satisfaction and turning to tom_loker and his companions
these yer dog has been raised to track nigger and they jest as soon chaw one on ye up as eat their supper
how now sambo he said to a ragged fellow without any brim to his hat who was officious in his attentions
ye see what ye get if ye try to run off so mind yerself how have thing been going
fust rate mas quimbo said simon_legree to another who was making zealous demonstrations to attract his attention ye minded what i telled ye
simon_legree had trained them in savageness and brutality as systematically as he had his bull dog and by long practice in hardness and cruelty brought their whole nature to about the same range of capacities
it is a common remark and one that is thought to militate strongly against the character of the race that the negro overseer is always more tyrannical and cruel than the white one
guess i did didnt i these two colored man were the two principal hand on the plantation this is simply saying that the negro mind has been more crushed and debased than the white
it is no more true of this race than of every oppressed race the world over the slave is always a tyrant if he can get a chance to be one
sambo and quimbo cordially hated each other the plantation hand one and all cordially hated them and by playing off one against another
he was pretty sure through one or the other of the three party to get informed of whatever was on foot in the place
nobody can live entirely without social intercourse and simon_legree encouraged his two black satellites to a kind of coarse familiarity with him a familiarity however at any moment liable to get one or the other of them into trouble for on the slightest provocation one of them always stood ready at a nod to be a minister of his vengeance on the other
as they stood there now by simon_legree they seemed an apt illustration of the fact that brutal man are lower even than animals
their coarse dark heavy features their great eye rolling enviously on each other their barbarous guttural half brute intonation their dilapidated garments fluttering in the wind were all in admirable keeping with the vile and unwholesome character of everything about the place
here you sambo said simon_legree take these yer boy down to the quarters and here a gal i ve got for you said he as he separated the mulatto woman from emmeline and pushed her towards him i promised to bring you one you know
simon_legree like some potentates we read of in history governed his plantation by a sort of resolution of forces
the woman gave a start and drawing back said suddenly mas i left my old man in new orleans what of that you wont you want one here
none your word go long said simon_legree raising his whip come mistress he said to emmeline you go in here with me
a dark wild face was seen for a moment to glance at the window of the house and as simon_legree opened the door a female voice said something in a quick imperative tone
tom_loker who was looking with anxious interest after emmeline as she went in noticed this and heard simon_legree answer angrily you may hold your tongue
i ll do as i please for all you tom_loker heard no more for he was soon following sambo to the quarters
the quarters was a little sort of street of rude shanties in a row in a part of the plantation far off from the house
he had been comforting himself with the thought of a cottage rude indeed but one which he might make neat and quiet and where he might have a shelf for his bible and a place to be alone out of his laboring hour
he looked into several they were mere rude shells destitute of any species of furniture except a heap of straw foul with dirt spread confusedly over the floor which was merely the bare ground trodden hard by the tramping of innumerable foot
they had a forlorn brutal forsaken air tom_loker heart sunk when he saw them which of these will be mine said he to sambo submissively
dunno ken turn in here i spose said sambo spects thar room for another thar thar a pretty smart heap nigger to each on em now sure i dunno what i to do with more
it was late in the evening when the weary occupants of the shanties came flocking home man and woman in soiled and tattered garments surly and uncomfortable and in no mood to look pleasantly on new comers
the small village was alive with no inviting sounds hoarse guttural voice contending at the hand mills where their morsel of hard corn was yet to be ground into meal to fit it for the cake that was to constitute their only supper
from the earliest dawn of the day they had been in the fields pressed to work under the driving lash of the overseers for it was now in the very heat and hurry of the season and no means was left untried to press every one up to the top of their capabilities
and it isnt much inconvenience either to have one drop of water fall on your head yet the worst torture of the inquisition is produced by drop after drop drop after drop falling moment after moment with monotonous succession on the same spot and work in itself
not hard becomes so by being pressed hour after hour with unvarying unrelenting sameness with not even the consciousness of free will to take from its tediousness
true says the negligent lounger picking cotton isnt hard work isnt it tom_loker looked in vain among the gang as they poured along for companionable face
he saw only sullen scowling imbruted man and feeble discouraged woman or woman that were not woman the strong pushing away the weak the gross unrestricted animal selfishness of human beings of whom nothing good was expected and desired and who treated in every way like brutes had sunk as nearly to their level as it was possible for human beings to do
to a late hour in the night the sound of the grinding was protracted for the mills were few in number compared with the grinders and the weary and feeble one were driven back by the strong and came on last in their turn
ho yo said sambo coming to the mulatto woman and throwing down a bag of corn before her what a cuss yo name
lucy said the woman wal lucy yo my woman now yo grind dis yer corn and get my supper baked ye har
i ant your woman and i wont be said the woman with the sharp sudden courage of despair you go long
i ll kick yo then said sambo raising his foot threateningly ye may kill me if ye choose the sooner the better
i say sambo you go to spilin the hand i ll tell mas o you said quimbo who was busy at the mill from which he had viciously driven two or three tired woman who were waiting to grind their corn
wisht i was dead said she and i ll tell him ye wont let the woman come to the mills yo old nigger said sambo
yo jes keep to yo own row tom_loker was hungry with his day journey and almost faint for want of food
thar yo said quimbo throwing down a coarse bag which contained a peck of corn thar nigger grab take car ont yo wont get no more dis yer week
tom_loker waited till a late hour to get a place at the mills and then moved by the utter weariness of two woman whom he saw trying to grind their corn there he ground for them put together the decaying brands of the fire where many had baked cakes before them and then went about getting his own supper
it was a new kind of work there a deed of charity small as it was but it woke an answering touch in their heart an expression of womanly kindness came over their hard face they mixed his cake for him and tended its baking and tom_loker sat down by the light of the fire and drew out his bible for he had need for comfort
what that said one of the woman a bible said tom_loker good lord hant seen un since i was in kentuck
was you raised in kentuck said tom_loker with interest yes and well raised too never spected to come to dis yer
said the woman sighing what dat ar book any way said the other woman why the bible
law a me what dat said the woman do tell you never hearn ont said the other woman
i used to har missis a readin ont sometimes in kentuck but law me we dont har nothing here
but crackin and swarin read a piece anyways said the first woman curiously seeing tom_loker attentively poring over it tom_loker read come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest
them good word enough said the woman who says em the lord said tom_loker i jest wish i know whar to find him said the woman
my flesh is fairly sore and i tremble all over every day and sambo allers a jawin at me cause i doesnt pick faster and night it most midnight fore
i would go pears like i never should get rested again i can get my supper and den pears like i dont turn over and shut my eye fore
i hear de horn blow to get up and at it agin in de mornin if i knew whar de lor was i tell him
he here he everywhere said tom_loker lor you ant gwine to make me believe dat ar i know de lord ant here said the woman tant no use talking though
the woman went off to their cabins and tom_loker sat alone by the smouldering fire that flickered up redly in his face
the silver fair browed moon rose in the purple sky and looked down calm and silent as god looks on the scene of misery and oppression looked calmly on the lone black man as he sat with his arm folded and his bible on his knee
ah how is it possible for the untaught heart to keep its faith unswerving in the face of dire misrule and palpable unrebuked injustice
in that simple heart waged a fierce conflict the crushing sense of wrong the foreshadowing of a whole life of future misery the wreck of all past hopes mournfully tossing in the soul sight like dead corpses of wife and child and friend rising from the dark wave and surging in the face of the half drowned mariner
ah was it easy here to believe and hold fast the great password of christian faith that god is and is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him
i jest gwine to camp down and sleep while i ken is god here tom_loker rose disconsolate and stumbled into the cabin that had been allotted to him
the floor was already strewn with weary sleepers and the foul air of the place almost repelled him but the heavy night dews were chill and his limbs weary and wrapping about him a tattered blanket which formed his only bed clothing he stretched himself in the straw and fell asleep
in dreams a gentle voice came over his ear he was sitting on the mossy seat in the garden by lake pontchartrain and miss_eva with her serious eye bent downward was reading to him from the bible and he heard her read
when thou passest through the water i will be with thee and the rivers they shall not overflow thee when thou walkest through the fire thou shalt not be burned neither shall the flame kindle upon thee for i am the lord thy god the holy one of israel thy saviour
gradually the word seemed to melt and fade as in a divine music the child raised her deep eye and fixed them lovingly on him and rays of warmth and comfort seemed to go from them to his heart and as if wafted on the music she seemed to rise on shining wings from which flakes and spangles of gold fell off like stars and she was gone
but who shall say that that sweet young spirit which in life so yearned to comfort and console the distressed was forbidden of god to assume this ministry after death
tom_loker woke was it a dream let it pass for one it is a beautiful belief that ever round our head are hovering on angel wings
and behold the tear of such as were oppressed and they had no comforter and on the side of their oppressors there was power but they had no comforter eccl
it took but a short time to familiarize tom_loker with all that was to be hoped or feared in his new way of life
he was an expert and efficient workman in whatever he undertook and was both from habit and principle prompt and faithful
quiet and peaceable in his disposition he hoped by unremitting diligence to avert from himself at least a portion of the evils of his condition
he saw enough of abuse and misery to make him sick and weary but he determined to toil on with religious patience committing himself to him that judgeth righteously not without hope that some way of escape might yet be opened to him
he rated him as a first class hand and yet he felt a secret dislike to him the native antipathy of bad to good
he saw plainly that when as was often the case his violence and brutality fell on the helpless tom_loker took notice of it for so subtle is the atmosphere of opinion that it will make itself felt without word and the opinion even of a slave may annoy a master
tom_loker in various way manifested a tenderness of feeling a commiseration for his fellow sufferers strange and new to them which was watched with a jealous eye by simon_legree
he had purchased tom_loker with a view of eventually making him a sort of overseer with whom he might at time intrust his affairs in short absences and in his view the first second and third requisite for that place was hardness
simon_legree made up his mind that as tom_loker was not hard to his hand he would harden him forthwith and some few weeks after tom_loker had been on the place he determined to commence the process
one morning when the hand were mustered for the field tom_loker noticed with surprise a new comer among them whose appearance excited his attention
it was a woman tall and slenderly formed with remarkably delicate hand and foot and dressed in neat and respectable garments
by the appearance of her face she might have been between thirty five and forty and it was a face that once seen could never be forgotten one of those that at a glance seem to convey to us an idea of a wild painful and romantic history
the spirit of the dead chapter xxxiii misse_cassy simon_legree took a silent note of tom_loker availability her forehead was high and her eyebrows marked with beautiful clearness
her straight well formed nose her finely cut mouth and the graceful contour of her head and neck showed that she must once have been beautiful but her face was deeply wrinkled with lines of pain and of proud and bitter endurance
but her eye was the most remarkable feature so large so heavily black overshadowed by long lashes of equal darkness and so wildly mournfully despairing
there was a fierce pride and defiance in every line of her face in every curve of the flexible lip in every motion of her body but in her eye was a deep settled night of anguish an expression so hopeless and unchanging as to contrast fearfully with the scorn and pride expressed by her whole demeanor
her complexion was sallow and unhealthy her cheeks thin her features sharp and her whole form emaciated where she came from or who she was tom_loker did not know
the first he did know she was walking by his side erect and proud in the dim gray of the dawn
to the gang however she was known for there was much looking and turning of head and a smothered yet apparent exultation among the miserable ragged half starved creature by whom she was surrounded
got to come to it at last glad of it said one he he he said another you ll know how good it is misse_cassy
we ll see her work wonder if she ll get a cutting up at night like the rest of us i be glad to see her down for a flogging i ll bound said another
the woman took no notice of these taunts but walked on with the same expression of angry scorn as if she heard nothing
tom_loker had always lived among refined and cultivated people and he felt intuitively from her air and bearing that she belonged to that class but how or why she could be fallen to those degrading circumstances he could not tell
the woman neither looked at him nor spoke to him though all the way to the field she kept close at his side
tom_loker was soon busy at his work but as the woman was at no great distance from him he often glanced an eye to her at her work
he saw at a glance that a native adroitness and handiness made the task to her an easier one than it proved to many
she picked very fast and very clean and with an air of scorn as if she despised both the work and the disgrace and humiliation of the circumstances in which she was placed
in the course of the day tom_loker was working near the mulatto woman who had been bought in the same lot with himself
she was evidently in a condition of great suffering and tom_loker often heard her praying as she wavered and trembled and seemed about to fall down
tom_loker silently as he came near to her transferred several handfuls of cotton from his own sack to hers dont dont said the woman looking surprised it ll get you into trouble
just then sambo came up he seemed to have a special spite against this woman and flourishing his whip said in brutal guttural tone
a and with the word kicking the woman with his heavy cowhide shoe he struck tom_loker across the face with his whip
what dis yer luce foolin tom_loker silently resumed his task but the woman before at the last point of exhaustion fainted
i ll give her something better than camphire and taking a pin from his coat sleeve he buried it to the head in her flesh
i ll bring her to said the driver with a brutal grin the woman groaned and half rose get up you beast and work will yer or i ll show yer a trick more
the woman seemed stimulated for a few moment to an unnatural strength and worked with desperate eagerness see that you keep to dat ar said the man or yer ll wish yer dead tonight i reckin
that i do now tom_loker heard her say and again he heard her say lord how long lord why dont you help us
at the risk of all that he might suffer tom_loker came forward again and put all the cotton in his sack into the woman
you mustnt you donno what they ll do to ye said the woman i can bar it said tom_loker better you and he was at his place again
suddenly the stranger woman whom we have described and who had in the course of her work come near enough to hear tom_loker last word raised her heavy black eye and fixed them for a second on him then taking a quantity of cotton from her basket she placed it in his
when you ve been here a month you ll be done helping anybody you ll find it hard enough to take care of your own skin
it passed in a moment you know nothing about this place she said or you wouldnt have done that
the lord forbid missis said tom_loker using instinctively to his field companion the respectful form proper to the high bred with whom he had lived
the lord never visits these part said the woman bitterly as she went nimbly forward with her work and again the scornful smile curled her lips
but the action of the woman had been seen by the driver across the field and flourishing his whip he came up to her
what what he said to the woman with an air of triumph you a foolin go along yer under me
a glance like sheet lightning suddenly flashed from those black eye and facing about with quivering lip and dilated nostrils she drew herself up and fixed a glance blazing with rage and scorn on the driver
now mind yourself or yer ll cotch it dog she said touch me if you dare i ve power enough yet to have you torn by the dog burnt alive cut to inches
i ve only to say the word what de devil you here for den said the man evidently cowed and sullenly retreating a step or two
and in truth the man seemed greatly inclined to attend to something at the other end of the field and started off in quick time
didnt mean no harm misse_cassy keep your distance then said the woman the woman suddenly turned to her work and labored with a despatch that was perfectly astonishing to tom_loker
before the day was through her basket was filled crowded down and piled and she had several time put largely into tom_loker
long after dusk the whole weary train with their baskets on their head defiled up to the building appropriated to the storing and weighing the cotton
dat ar tom_loker gwine to make a powerful deal trouble kept a puttin into lucy basket one these yer dat will get all der nigger to feelin bused if masir dont watch him said sambo
she seemed to work by magic simon_legree was there busily conversing with the two drivers hey dey the black cuss said simon_legree
he ll have to get a breakin in wont he boy both negroes grinned a horrid grin at this intimation
ay ay let mas simon_legree alone for breakin in de debil heself couldnt beat mas at dat said quimbo wal boy the best way is to give him the flogging to do till he gets over his notions
break him in lord mas ll have hard work to get dat out him it ll have to come out of him though said simon_legree as he rolled his tobacco in his mouth
now dar lucy de aggravatinest ugliest wench on de place pursued sambo take care sam i shall begin to think what the reason for your spite agin lucy
i a flogged her intot said simon_legree spitting only there such a press work it dont seem wuth a while to upset her jist now
well mas knows she sot herself up agin mas and wouldnt have me when he telled her to she slender but these yer slender gal will bear half killin to get their own way
wal lucy was real aggravatin and lazy sulkin round wouldnt do nothing and tom_loker he stuck up for her he did eh
wal then tom_loker shall have the pleasure of flogging her it ll be a good practice for him and he wont put it on to the gal like you devils neither
laughed both the sooty wretches and the diabolical sounds seemed in truth a not unapt expression of the fiendish character which simon_legree gave them
ho ho haw haw haw wal but mas tom_loker and misse_cassy and dey among em filled lucy basket i ruther guess der weight in it mas
i do the weighing said simon_legree emphatically both the drivers again laughed their diabolical laugh so he added misse_cassy did her day work
she picks like de debil and all his angels she got em all in her i believe said simon_legree and growling a brutal oath he proceeded to the weighing room
slowly the weary dispirited creature wound their way into the room and with crouching reluctance presented their baskets to be weighed
tom_loker basket was weighed and approved and he looked with an anxious glance for the success of the woman he had befriended
simon_legree noted on a slate on the side of which was pasted a list of names the amount tottering with weakness she came forward and delivered her basket
it was of full weight as simon_legree well perceived but affecting anger he said what you lazy beast short again stand aside you ll catch it pretty soon
the woman gave a groan of utter despair and sat down on a board the person who had been called misse_cassy now came forward and with a haughty negligent air delivered her basket
as she delivered it simon_legree looked in her eye with a sneering yet inquiring glance she fixed her black eye steadily on him her lips moved slightly and she said something in french
what it was no one knew but simon_legree face became perfectly demoniacal in its expression as she spoke he half raised his hand as if to strike a gesture which she regarded with fierce disdain as she turned and walked away
i didnt buy ye jest for the common work i mean to promote ye and make a driver of ye and tonight ye may jest as well begin to get yer hand in
and now said simon_legree come here you tom_loker you see i telled ye now ye jest take this yer gal and flog her ye ve seen enough ont to know how
i beg mas s pardon said tom_loker hopes mas wont set me at that it what i ant used to never did and cant do no way possible
ye ll larn a pretty smart chance of thing ye never did know before i ve done with ye said simon_legree taking up a cowhide and striking tom_loker
a heavy blow cross the cheek and following up the infliction by a shower of blows there he said as he stopped to rest now will ye tell me ye cant do it
i willin to work night and day and work while there life and breath in me but this yer thing i cant feel it right to do and mas i never shall do it never
tom_loker had a remarkably smooth soft voice and a habitually respectful manner that had given simon_legree an idea that he would be cowardly and easily subdued
when he spoke these last word a thrill of amazement went through every one the poor woman clasped her hand and said lord and every one involuntarily looked at each other and drew in their breath as if to prepare for the storm that was about to burst
yes mas said tom_loker putting up his hand to wipe the blood that trickled down his face simon_legree looked stupefied and confounded but at last burst forth what
ye blasted black beast tell me ye dont think it right to do what i tell ye what have any of you cussed cattle to do with thinking what right
i ll put a stop to it why what do ye think ye are may be ye think ye a gentleman master tom_loker to be a telling your master
i think so mas said tom_loker the poor crittur sick and feeblet would be downright cruel and it what i never will do nor begin to
if you mean to kill me kill me but as to my raising my hand agin any one here i never shall i ll die first
what right and what aint so you pretend it wrong to flog the gal mas tom_loker spoke in a mild voice but with a decision that could not be mistaken
simon_legree shook with anger his greenish eye glared fiercely and his very whiskers seemed to curl with passion but like some ferocious beast that plays with its victim before he devours it he kept back his strong impulse to proceed to immediate violence and broke out into bitter raillery
well here a pious dog at last let down among us sinners a saint a gentleman and no less to talk to us sinners about our sins
here you rascal you make believe to be so pious didnt you never hear out of yer bible servant obey yer master
powerful holy critter he must be ant i yer master didnt i pay down twelve hundred dollar cash for all there is inside yer old cussed black shell
ant yer mine now body and soul he said giving tom_loker a violent kick with his heavy boot tell me
in the very depth of physical suffering bowed by brutal oppression this question shot a gleam of joy and triumph through tom_loker soul
he suddenly stretched himself up and looking earnestly to heaven while the tear and blood that flowed down his face mingled he exclaimed no no no
it been bought and paid for by one that is able to keep it no matter no matter you cant harm me
my soul ant yours mas you havent bought it ye cant buy it i cant said simon_legree with a sneer we ll see we ll see
the two gigantic negroes that now laid hold of tom_loker with fiendish exultation in their face might have formed no unapt personification of power of darkness
the poor woman screamed with apprehension and all rose as by a general impulse while they dragged him unresisting from the place
here sambo quimbo give this dog such a breakin in as he wont get over this month chapter xxxiv the quadroon story
and behold the tear of such as are oppressed and on the side of their oppressors there was power wherefore i praised the dead that are already dead more than the living that are yet alive eccl
it was late at night and tom_loker lay groaning and bleeding alone in an old forsaken room of the gin house among pieces of broken machinery piles of damaged cotton and other rubbish which had there accumulated
the night was damp and close and the thick air swarmed with myriads of mosquitos which increased the restless torture of his wounds whilst a burning thirst a torture beyond all others filled up the uttermost measure of physical anguish
good lord do look down give me the victory give me the victory over all prayed poor tom_loker in his anguish
a footstep entered the room behind him and the light of a lantern flashed on his eye who there for the lord massy please give me some water
the woman misse_cassy for it was she set down her lantern and pouring water from a bottle raised his head and gave him drink
another and another cup were drained with feverish eagerness drink all ye want she said i knew how it would be
it isnt the first time i ve been out in the night carrying water to such as you thank you missis said tom_loker when he had done drinking
i a miserable slave like yourself a lower one than you can ever be said she bitterly but now said she going to the door and dragging in a small pallaise over which she had spread linen cloths wet with cold water try my poor fellow to roll yourself on to this
stiff with wounds and bruises tom_loker was a long time in accomplishing this movement but when done he felt a sensible relief from the cooling application to his wounds
the woman whom long practice with the victims of brutality had made familiar with many healing arts went on to make many applications to tom_loker wounds by means of which he was soon somewhat relieved
now said the woman when she had raised his head on a roll of damaged cotton which served for a pillow there the best i can do for you
tom_loker thanked her and the woman sitting down on the floor drew up her knees and embracing them with her arm looked fixedly before her with a bitter and painful expression of countenance
dont call me missis her bonnet fell back and long wavy streams of black hair fell around her singular and melancholy face
it no use my poor fellow she broke out at last it of no use this you ve been trying to do
fellow you had the right on your side but it all in vain and out of the question for you to struggle
you were a brave you are in the devil hand he is the strongest and you must give up give up
tom_loker started for the bitter woman with her wild eye and melancholy voice seemed to him an embodiment of the temptation with which he had been wrestling
and had not human weakness and physical agony whispered that before lord lord he groaned how can i give up
there no use calling on the lord he never hears said the woman steadily there isnt any god i believe or if there is he taken side against us
all goes against us heaven and earth everything is pushing us into hell why shouldnt we go tom_loker closed his eye and shuddered at the dark atheistic word
i ve been on this place five year body and soul under this man foot and i hate him as i do the devil
here you are on a lone plantation ten miles from any other in the swamps not a white person here who could testify if you were burned
you see said the woman you dont know anything about it i do alive if you were scalded cut into inch pieces set up for the dog to tear or hung up and whipped to death
there no law here of god or man that can do you or any one of us the least good and this man
i could make any one hair rise and their teeth chatter if i should only tell what i ve seen and been knowing to
there no earthly thing that he too good to do here and it no use resisting did i want to live with him
wasnt i a woman delicately bred and he god in heaven what was he and is he and yet i ve lived with him these five year and cursed every moment of my life night and day
her good mistress taught her to read the bible and she brought her bible here to hell with her and the woman laughed a wild and doleful laugh that rung with a strange supernatural sound through the old ruined shed
and now he got a new one a young thing only fifteen and she brought up she says piously tom_loker folded his hand all was darkness and horror
lord_jesus lord_jesus have you quite forgot us poor critturs burst forth at last help lord i perish
the woman sternly continued and what are these miserable low dog you work with that you should suffer on their account
they are all of em as low and cruel to each other as they can be there no use in your suffering to keep from hurting them
poor critturs said tom_loker what made em cruel and if i give out i shall get used tot and grow little by little just like em
every one of them would turn against you the first time they got a chance no no missis i ve lost everything wife and child and home and a kind mas and
he would have set me free if he only lived a week longer i ve lost everything in this world and it clean gone
but it cant be that the lord will lay sin to our account said the woman he wont charge it to us when we re forced to it he ll charge it to them that drove us to it
forever and now i cant lose heaven too no i cant get to be wicked besides all yes said tom_loker but that wont keep us from growing wicked
if i get to be as hard hearted as that ar sambo and as wicked it wont make much odds to me how i come so it the bein
the woman fixed a wild and startled look on tom_loker as if a new thought had struck her and then heavily groaning said god a mercy
so that ar what i a dreadin you speak the truth o and with groans she fell on the floor like one crushed and writhing under the extremity of mental anguish
there was a silence a while in which the breathing of both party could be heard when tom_loker faintly said please missis
please missis i saw em throw my coat in that ar corner and in my coat pocket is my bible if missis would please get it for me
the woman suddenly rose up with her face composed to its usual stern melancholy expression misse_cassy went and got it
tom_loker opened at once to a heavily marked passage much worn of the last scenes in the life of him by whose stripes we are healed
if missis would only be so good as read that ar it better than water misse_cassy took the book with a dry proud air and looked over the passage
she then read aloud in a soft voice and with a beauty of intonation that was peculiar that touching account of anguish and of glory
often as she read her voice faltered and sometimes failed her altogether when she would stop with an air of frigid composure till she had mastered herself
when she came to the touching word father forgive them for they know not what they do she threw down the book and burying her face in the heavy masses of her hair she sobbed aloud with a convulsive violence
if we only could keep up to that ar said tom_loker it seemed to come so natural to him and we have to fight so hard fort
tom_loker was weeping also and occasionally uttering a smothered ejaculation lord help us blessed lord_jesus do help us
missis said tom_loker after a while i can see that some how you re quite bove me in everything but there one thing missis might learn even from poor tom_loker
ye said the lord took side against us because he lets us be bused and knocked round but ye see what come on his own son the blessed lord of glory want he allays poor
and have we any on us yet come so low as he come the lord hant forgot us i sartin that ar
if we suffer with him we shall also reign scripture says but if we deny him he also will deny us
it tells how they was stoned and sawn asunder and wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins and was destitute afflicted tormented
no reason to make us think the lord turned agin us but jest the contrary if only we hold on to him and doesnt give up to sin
didnt they all suffer the lord and all his sufferin ant but why does he put us where we cant help but sin said the woman
i think we can help it said tom_loker you ll see said misse_cassy what ll you do tomorrow they ll be at you again
i know em i ve seen all their doings i cant bear to think of all they ll bring you to and they ll make you give out at last
lord_jesus said tom_loker you will take care of my soul lord do dont let me give out dear said misse_cassy
i ve heard all this crying and praying before and yet they ve been broken down and brought under there emmeline she trying to hold on and you re trying but what use
spin it out as long as they can they cant help my dying some time and after that they cant do no more
you must give up or be killed by inches well then i will die said tom_loker i clar i set
i know the lord ll help me and bring me through the woman did not answer she sat with her black eye intently fixed on the floor
may be it the way she murmured to herself but those that have given up there no hope for them none
we live in filth and grow loathsome till we loathe ourselves and we long to die and we dont dare to kill ourselves no hope
no hope no hope this girl now just as old as i was you see me now she said speaking to tom_loker very rapidly see what i am
well i was brought up in luxury the first i remember is playing about when i was a child in splendid parlors when i was kept dressed up like a doll and company and visitors used to praise me
there was a garden opening from the saloon window and there i used to play hide and go seek under the orange trees with my brothers and sisters
i went to a convent and there i learned music french and embroidery and what not and when i was fourteen i came out to my father funeral
he died very suddenly and when the property came to be settled they found that there was scarcely enough to cover the debts and when the creditors took an inventory of the property i was set down in it
my mother was a slave woman and my father had always meant to set me free but he had not done it and so i was set down in the list
i always known who i was but never thought much about it nobody ever expects that a strong healthy man is going to die
my father was a well man only four hour before he died it was one of the first cholera case in new orleans
the day after the funeral my father wife took her child and went up to her father plantation i thought they treated me strangely but didnt know
there was a young lawyer who they left to settle the business and he came every day and was about the house and spoke very politely to me
he brought with him one day a young man whom i thought the handsomest i had ever seen i shall never forget that evening
i was lonesome and full of sorrow and he was so kind and gentle to me and he told me that he had seen me before i went to the convent and that he had loved me a great while and that he would be my friend and protector in short though he didnt tell me he had paid two thousand dollar for me and i was his property i became his willingly for i loved him
i walked with him in the garden loved said the woman stopping how i did love that man how i love him now and always shall while i breathe
he was so beautiful so high so noble he put me into a beautiful house with servant horse and carriages and furniture and dresses
everything that money could buy he gave me but i didnt set any value on all that i only cared for him
i loved him better than my god and my own soul and if i tried i couldnt do any other way from what he wanted me to
i thought if he loved me as he said he did and if i was what he seemed to think i was he would be willing to marry me and set me free
but he convinced me that it would be impossible and he told me that if we were only faithful to each other it was marriage before god
i wanted only one thing i did want him to marry me if that is true wasnt i that man wife
wasnt i faithful for seven year didnt i study every look and motion and only live and breathe to please him
i alone and gave him all his medicine and did everything for him and then he called me his good angel and said i saved his life
he had the yellow fever and for twenty day and night i watched with him we had two beautiful child the first was a boy and we called him henry
had such beautiful eye such a forehead and his hair hung all in curls around it and he had all his father spirit and his talent too
he used to tell me that i was the most beautiful woman in louisiana he was so proud of me and the child
he used to love to have me dress them up and take them and me about in an open carriage and hear the remarks that people would make on us and he used to fill my ear constantly with the fine thing that were said in praise of me and the child
he was the image of his father he little elise he said looked like me those were happy day i thought i was as happy as any one could be but then there came evil time
from the first time i saw him i couldnt tell why i dreaded him for i felt sure he was going to bring misery on us
he got henry to going out with him and often he would not come home night till two or three clock
he had a cousin come to new orleans who was his particular friend he thought all the world of him but i did not dare say a word
he got him to the gaming house and he was one of the sort that when he once got a going there there was no holding back
for henry was so high spirited i was afraid to and then he introduced him to another lady and i saw soon that his heart was gone from me
he never told me but i saw it i knew it day after day i felt my heart breaking but i could not say a word
at this the wretch offered to buy me and the child of henry to clear off his gambling debts which stood in the way of his marrying as he
wished and he sold us he told me one day that he had business in the country and should be gone two or three weeks
he spoke kinder than usual and said he should come back but it didnt deceive me i knew that the time had come
i was just like one turned into stone i couldnt speak nor shed a tear he kissed me and kissed the child a good many time and went out
i saw him get on his horse and i watched him till he was quite out of sight and then i fell down and fainted
then he came the cursed wretch he came to take possession he told me that he had bought me and my child and showed me the paper
just as you please said he but if you dont behave reasonably i ll sell both the child where you shall never see them again
he told me that he always had meant to have me from the first time he saw me and that he had drawn henry on and got him in debt on purpose to make him willing to sell me
that he got him in love with another woman and that i might know after all that that he should not give up for a few air and tear and thing of that sort
i cursed him before god and told him i die sooner than live with him i gave up for my hand were tied
he had my child whenever i resisted his will anywhere he would talk about selling them and he made me as submissive as he desired
o what a life it was to live with my heart breaking every day to keep on on on loving when it was only misery and to be bound body and soul to one i hated
i used to love to read to henry to play to him to waltz with him and sing to him but everything i did for this one was a perfect drag yet
elise was a timid little thing but henry was bold and high spirited like his father and he had never been brought under in the least by any one
i was afraid to refuse anything he was very imperious and harsh to the child he was always finding fault and quarrelling with him and i used to live in daily fear and dread
i tried to make the child respectful i tried to keep them apart for i held on to those child like death but it did no good
he sold both those child he took me to ride one day and when i came home they were nowhere to be found
he told me he had sold them he showed me the money the price of their blood then it seemed as if all good forsook me
i raved and cursed cursed god and man and for a while i believe he really was afraid of me but he didnt give up so
he told me that my child were sold but whether i ever saw their face again depended on him and that if i wasnt quiet they should smart for it
he made me submit he made me be peaceable he flattered me with hopes that perhaps he would buy them back and so thing went on a week or two
one day i was out walking and passed by the calaboose i saw a crowd about the gate and heard a child voice and
suddenly my henry broke away from two or three man who were holding him and ran screaming and caught my dress
they came up to him swearing dreadfully and one man whose face i shall never forget told him that he wouldnt get away so that he was going with him into the calaboose and he get a lesson there
i tried to beg and plead they only laughed the poor boy screamed and looked into my face and held on to me until in tearing him off they tore the skirt of my dress half away and they carried him in screaming mother
well you can do anything with a woman when you ve got her child he never forget mother mother there was one man stood there seemed to pity me
he shook his head and said that the boy had been impudent and disobedient ever since he bought him that he was going to break him in once for all
i offered him all the money i had if he only interfere i turned and ran and every step of the way i thought that i heard him scream
i got into the house ran all out of breath to the parlor where i found butler i told him and begged him to go and interfere
he only laughed and told me the boy had got his deserts he got to be broken in the sooner the better what did i expect
i remember seeing a great sharp bowie knife on the table i remember something about catching it and flying upon him and then all grew dark and i didnt know any more not for day and day
he asked it seemed to me something in my head snapped at that moment i felt dizzy and furious
an old black woman tended me and a doctor came to see me and there was a great deal of care taken of me
after a while i found that he had gone away and left me at this house to be sold and that why they took such pains with me
i didnt mean to get well and hoped i shouldnt but in spite of me the fever went off and i grew healthy and finally got up
then they made me dress up every day and gentleman used to come in and stand and smoke their cigars and look at me and ask questions and debate my price
when i came to myself i was in a nice room but not mine i was so gloomy and silent that none of them wanted me
they threatened to whip me if i wasnt gayer and didnt take some pains to make myself agreeable at length one day came a gentleman named stuart
he seemed to have some feeling for me he saw that something dreadful was on my heart and he came to see me alone a great many time and finally persuaded me to tell him
he went to the hotel where my henry was they told him he had been sold to a planter up on pearl river that was the last that i ever heard
he bought me at last and promised to do all he could to find and buy back my child then he found where my daughter was an old woman was keeping her
butler found out that it was for me he wanted her and he sent me word that i should never have her
he offered an immense sum for her but they would not sell her captain stuart was very kind to me he had a splendid plantation and took me to it
in the course of a year i had a son born that child how i loved it how just like my poor henry the little thing looked
but i had made up my mind yes i had i would never again let a child live to grow up
i took the little fellow in my arm when he was two weeks old and kissed him and cried over him and then i gave him laudanum and held him close to my bosom while he slept to death
how i mourned and cried over it and who ever dreamed that it was anything but a mistake that had made me give it the laudanum
but it one of the few thing that i glad of now i am not sorry to this day he at least is out of pain
after a while the cholera came and captain stuart died everybody died that wanted to live and i i though i went down to death door
then i was sold and passed from hand to hand till i grew faded and wrinkled and i had a fever and then this wretch bought me and brought me here and here i am
she had hurried on through her story with a wild passionate utterance sometimes seeming to address it to tom_loker and sometimes speaking as in a soliloquy
so vehement and overpowering was the force with which she spoke that for a season tom_loker was beguiled even from the pain of his wounds and raising himself on one elbow watched her as she paced restlessly up and down her long black hair swaying heavily about her as she moved
you tell me she said after a pause that there is a god a god that looks down and sees all these thing
what better than death could i give him poor child i lived the woman stopped may be it so
the sisters in the convent used to tell me of a day of judgment when everything is coming to light wont there be vengeance then
it all a small matter yet i ve walked the streets when it seemed as if i had misery enough in my one heart to sink the city
they think it nothing what we suffer nothing what our child suffer i ve wished the house would fall on me or the stones sink under me
and in the judgment day i will stand up before god a witness against those that have ruined me and my child body and soul
now i a lost soul pursued by devils that torment me day and night they keep pushing me on and on and i ll do it too some of these day
yes when i was a girl i thought i was religious i used to love god and prayer she said clenching her hand while an insane light glanced in her heavy black eye
a wild long laugh rang through the deserted room and ended in a hysteric sob she threw herself on the floor in convulsive sobbing and struggles
i ll send him where he belongs a short way too one of these night if they burn me alive for it in a few moment the frenzy fit seemed to pass off she rose slowly and seemed to collect herself
can i do anything more for you my poor fellow she said approaching where tom_loker lay shall i give you some more water
there was a graceful and compassionate sweetness in her voice and manner as she said this that formed a strange contrast with the former wildness
tom_loker drank the water and looked earnestly and pitifully into her face missis i wish you go to him that can give you living water
i used to see the picture of him over the altar when i was a girl said misse_cassy her dark eye fixing themselves in an expression of mournful reverie
go to him where is he who is he said misse_cassy him that you read of to me the lord but he isnt here
there nothing here but sin and long long long despair she laid her hand on her breast and drew in her breath as if to lift a heavy weight
tom_loker looked as if he would speak again but she cut him short with a decided gesture dont talk my poor fellow
try to sleep if you can and placing water in his reach and making whatever little arrangements for his comforts she could misse_cassy left the shed
and slight withal may be the thing that bring back on the heart the weight which it would fling aside forever it may be a sound a flower the wind the ocean which shall wound
chapter xxxv the tokens striking the electric chain wherewith we re darkly bound childe harold pilgrimage can the sitting room of simon_legree establishment was a large long room with a wide ample fireplace
it had once been hung with a showy and expensive paper which now hung mouldering torn and discolored from the damp walls
the place had that peculiar sickening unwholesome smell compounded of mingled damp dirt and decay which one often notices in close old house
the wall paper was defaced in spots by slops of beer and wine or garnished with chalk memorandums and long sums footed up as if somebody had been practising arithmetic there
in the fireplace stood a brazier full of burning charcoal for though the weather was not cold the evening always seemed damp and chilly in that great room and simon_legree moreover wanted a place to light his cigars and heat his water for punch
the ruddy glare of the charcoal displayed the confused and unpromising aspect of the room saddles bridles several sort of harness riding whips overcoats and various articles of clothing scattered up and down the room in confused variety and the dog of whom we have before spoken had encamped themselves among them to suit their own taste and convenience
simon_legree was just mixing himself a tumbler of punch pouring his hot water from a cracked and broken nosed pitcher grumbling as he did so plague on that sambo to kick up this yer row between me and the new hand
the fellow wont be fit to work for a week now right in the press of the season yes just like you said a voice behind his chair
it was the woman misse_cassy who had stolen upon his soliloquy hah you she devil you ve come back have you yes i have she said coolly come to have my own way too
you lie you jade i ll be up to my word either behave yourself or stay down to the quarters and fare and work with the rest
i rather ten thousand time said the woman live in the dirtiest hole at the quarters than be under your hoof
but you are under my hoof for all that said he turning upon her with a savage grin that one comfort
so sit down here on my knee my dear and hear to reason said he laying hold on her wrist
simon_legree take care said the woman with a sharp flash of her eye a glance so wild and insane in its light as to be almost appalling
you re afraid of me simon_legree she said deliberately and you ve reason to be but be careful for i ve got the devil in me
the last word she whispered in a hissing tone close to his ear get out i believe to my soul you have said simon_legree pushing her from him and looking uncomfortably at her
after all misse_cassy he said why cant you be friend with me as you used to used to said she bitterly
misse_cassy had always kept over simon_legree the kind of influence that a strong impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man but of late she had grown more and more irritable and restless under the hideous yoke of her servitude and her irritability at time broke out into raving insanity and this liability made her a sort of object of dread to simon_legree who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is common to coarse and uninstructed mind
when simon_legree brought emmeline to the house all the smouldering embers of womanly feeling flashed up in the worn heart of misse_cassy and she took part with the girl and a fierce quarrel ensued between her and simon_legree
she stopped short a word of choking feeling rising in her heart kept her silent simon_legree in a fury swore she should be put to field service if she would not be peaceable
misse_cassy with proud scorn declared she would go to the field and she worked there one day as we have described to show how perfectly she scorned the threat
when she presented her basket at the scales he had hoped for some concession and addressed her in a sort of half conciliatory half scornful tone and she had answered with the bitterest contempt
the outrageous treatment of poor tom_loker had roused her still more and she had followed simon_legree to the house with no particular intention but to upbraid him for his brutality
simon_legree was secretly uneasy all day for misse_cassy had an influence over him from which he could not free himself
and what have you been doing you who havent even sense enough to keep from spoiling one of your best hand right in the most pressing season just for your devilish temper
i wish misse_cassy said simon_legree you behave yourself decently you talk about behaving decently i was a fool it a fact to let any such brangle come up said simon_legree
but when the boy set up his will he had to be broke in i reckon you wont break him in
wont i said simon_legree rising passionately i like to know if i wont he ll be the first nigger that ever came it round me
i ll break every bone in his body but he shall give up just then the door opened and sambo entered
he came forward bowing and holding out something in a paper what that you dog said simon_legree it a witch thing mas
a what something that nigger gets from witches keeps em from feelin when they flogged he had it tied round his neck with a black string
there dropped out of it a silver dollar and a long shining curl of fair hair hair which like a living thing twined itself round simon_legree fingers
simon_legree like most godless and cruel man was superstitious he took the paper and opened it uneasily damnation he screamed in sudden passion stamping on the floor and pulling furiously at the hair as if it burned him
where did this come from take it off burn it up burn it up he screamed tearing it off and throwing it into the charcoal
sambo stood with his heavy mouth wide open and aghast with wonder and misse_cassy who was preparing to leave the apartment stopped and looked at him in perfect amazement
what did you bring it to me for dont you bring me any more of your devilish thing
said he shaking his fist at sambo who retreated hastily towards the door and picking up the silver dollar he sent it smashing through the window pane out into the darkness
sambo was glad to make his escape when he was gone simon_legree seemed a little ashamed of his fit of alarm
misse_cassy prepared herself for going out unobserved by him and slipped away to minister to poor tom_loker as we have already related
he sat doggedly down in his chair and began sullenly sipping his tumbler of punch and what was the matter with simon_legree
and what was there in a simple curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man familiar with every form of cruelty
hard and reprobate as the godless man seemed now there had been a time when he had been rocked on the bosom of a mother cradled with prayers and pious hymns his now seared brow bedewed with the water of holy baptism
to answer this we must carry the reader backward in his history in early childhood a fair haired woman had led him at the sound of sabbath bell to worship and to pray
born of a hard tempered sire on whom that gentle woman had wasted a world of unvalued love simon_legree had followed in the steps of his father
boisterous unruly and tyrannical he despised all her counsel and would none of her reproof and at an early age broke from her to seek his fortunes at sea
he never came home but once after and then his mother with the yearning of a heart that must love something and has nothing else to love clung to him and sought with passionate prayers and entreaties to win him from a life of sin to his soul eternal good
that was simon_legree day of grace then good angels called him then he was almost persuaded and mercy held him by the hand
his heart inly relented there was a conflict but sin got the victory and he set all the force of his rough nature against the conviction of his conscience
far in new england that mother had trained her only son with long unwearied love and patient prayers he drank and swore was wilder and more brutal than ever
and one night when his mother in the last agony of her despair knelt at his foot he spurned her from him threw her senseless on the floor and with brutal curses fled to his ship
the next simon_legree heard of his mother was when one night as he was carousing among drunken companions a letter was put into his hand
he opened it and a lock of long curling hair fell from it and twined about his fingers the letter told him his mother was dead and that dying she blest and forgave him
there is a dread unhallowed necromancy of evil that turns thing sweetest and holiest to phantoms of horror and affright that pale loving mother her dying prayers her forgiving
love wrought in that demoniac heart of sin only as a damning sentence bringing with it a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation
simon_legree burned the hair and burned the letter and when he saw them hissing and crackling in the flame inly shuddered as he thought of everlasting fire
he tried to drink and revel and swear away the memory but often in the deep night whose solemn stillness arraigns the bad soul in forced communion with herself he had seen that pale mother rising by his bedside and felt the soft twining of that hair around his fingers till the cold sweat would roll down his face and he would spring from his bed in horror
ye who have wondered to hear in the same evangel that god is love and that god is a consuming fire see ye not how to the soul resolved in evil perfect love is the most fearful torture the seal and sentence of the direst despair
blast it said simon_legree to himself as he sipped his liquor where did he get that if it didnt look just like whoo
i thought i forgot that curse me if i think there any such thing as forgetting anything any how hang it i lonesome
simon_legree stepped out into a large entry which went up stairs by what had formerly been a superb winding staircase but the passage way was dirty and dreary encumbered with boxes and unsightly litter
i mean to call em she hates me the monkey i dont care i ll make her come the stairs uncarpeted seemed winding up in the gloom to nobody knew where
the pale moonlight streamed through a shattered fanlight over the door the air was unwholesome and chilly like that of a vault
simon_legree stopped at the foot of the stairs and heard a voice singing it seemed strange and ghostlike in that dreary old house perhaps because of the already tremulous state of his nerves
a wild pathetic voice chants a hymn common among the slave there ll be mourning mourning mourning there ll be mourning at the judgment seat of jesus_christ
hark what is it blast the girl said simon_legree i ll choke her em em he called harshly but only a mocking echo from the walls answered him
the sweet voice still sung on parents and child there shall part parents and child there shall part shall part to meet no more
and clear and loud swelled through the empty halls the refrain there ll be mourning mourning mourning there ll be mourning at the judgment seat of jesus_christ
he would have been ashamed to tell of it but large drops of sweat stood on his forehead his heart beat heavy and thick with fear he even thought he saw something white rising and glimmering in the gloom before him and shuddered to think what if the form of his dead mother should suddenly appear to him
i know one thing he said to himself as he stumbled back in the sitting room and sat down i ll let that fellow alone after this
simon_legree stopped what did i want of his cussed paper i lieve i am bewitched sure enough i ve been shivering and sweating ever since
where did he get that hair it couldnt have been that i burnt that up i know i did it would be a joke if hair could rise from the dead
ah simon_legree that golden tress was charmed each hair had in it a spell of terror and remorse for thee and was used by a mightier power to bind thy cruel hand from inflicting uttermost evil on the helpless
i say said simon_legree stamping and whistling to the dog wake up some of you and keep me company but the dog only opened one eye at him sleepily and closed it again
i ll have sambo and quimbo up here to sing and dance one of their hell dances and keep off these horrid notions said simon_legree and putting on his hat he went on to the verandah and blew a horn with which he commonly summoned his two sable drivers
simon_legree was often wont when in a gracious humor to get these two worthies into his sitting room and after warming them up with whiskey amuse himself by setting them to singing dancing or fighting as the humor took him
it was between one and two clock at night as misse_cassy was returning from her ministrations to poor tom_loker that she heard the sound of wild shrieking whooping halloing and singing from the sitting room mingled with the barking of dog and other symptoms of general uproar
simon_legree and both the drivers in a state of furious intoxication were singing whooping upsetting chair and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid grimaces at each other
she rested her small slender hand on the window blind and looked fixedly at them there was a world of anguish scorn and fierce bitterness in her black eye as she did so
she came up on the verandah steps and looked in would it be a sin to rid the world of such a wretch
she said to herself she turned hurriedly away and passing round to a back door glided up stairs and tapped at emmeline door
chapter xxxvi emmeline and misse_cassy cassy entered the room and found emmeline sitting pale with fear in the furthest corner of it
as she came in the girl started up nervously but on seeing who it was rushed forward and catching her arm said misse_cassy is it you
i so glad you ve come i was afraid it was you dont know what a horrid noise there has been down stairs all this evening
i ought to know said misse_cassy dryly i ve heard it often enough misse_cassy do tell me couldnt we get away from this place
i dont care where into the swamp among the snakes anywhere couldnt we get somewhere away from here nowhere but into our graves said misse_cassy
did you ever try i ve seen enough of trying and what comes of it said misse_cassy i be willing to live in the swamps and gnaw the bark from trees
there have been a good many here of your opinion said misse_cassy but you couldnt stay in the swamps you be tracked by the dog and brought back and then then
i ant afraid of snakes i rather have one near me than him said emmeline eagerly what would he do said the girl looking with breathless interest into her face
what wouldnt he do you better ask said misse_cassy he learned his trade well among the pirates in the west indies
you wouldnt sleep much if i should tell you thing i ve seen thing that he tells of sometimes for good jokes i ve heard screams here that i havent been able to get out of my head for weeks and weeks
there a place way out down by the quarters where you can see a black blasted tree and the ground all covered with black ashes
ask anyone what was done there and see if they will dare to tell you what do you mean i wont tell you
and i tell you the lord only knows what we may see tomorrow if that poor fellow holds out as he begun
i hate to think of it horrid said emmeline every drop of blood receding from her cheeks misse_cassy do tell me what i shall do
what i ve done do the best you can do what you must and make it up in hating and cursing
he wanted to make me drink some of his hateful brandy said emmeline and i hate it so you better drink said misse_cassy
i hated it too and now i cant live without it one must have something thing dont look so dreadful when you take that
mother used to tell me never to touch any such thing said emmeline mother told you said misse_cassy with a thrilling and bitter emphasis on the word mother
what use is it for mother to say anything you are all to be bought and paid for and your soul belong to whoever gets you
that the way it goes i say drink brandy drink all you can and it ll make thing come easier misse_cassy do pity me
pity you dont i havent i a daughter lord knows where she is and whose she is now going the way her mother went before her i suppose and that her child must go after her
there no end to the curse forever i wish i never been born said emmeline wringing her hand that an old wish with me said misse_cassy
i die if i dared to she said looking out into the darkness with that still fixed despair which was the habitual expression of her face when at rest
i ve got used to wishing that it would be wicked to kill one self said emmeline i dont know why no wickeder than thing we live and do day after day
if it would only be the end of us why then emmeline turned away and hid her face in her hand
while this conversation was passing in the chamber simon_legree overcome with his carouse had sunk to sleep in the room below
but the sisters told me thing when i was in the convent that make me afraid to die simon_legree was not an habitual drunkard
his coarse strong nature craved and could endure a continual stimulation that would have utterly wrecked and crazed a finer one
but a deep underlying spirit of cautiousness prevented his often yielding to appetite in such measure as to lose control of himself
this night however in his feverish efforts to banish from his mind those fearful elements of woe and remorse which woke within him he had indulged more than common so that when he had discharged his sable attendants he fell heavily on a settle in the room and was sound asleep
o how dares the bad soul to enter the shadowy world of sleep that land whose dim outlines lie so fearfully near to the mystic scene of retribution
simon_legree dreamed in his heavy and feverish sleep a veiled form stood beside him and laid a cold soft hand upon him
he thought he knew who it was and shuddered with creeping horror though the face was veiled then he thought he felt
that hair twining round his fingers and then that it slid smoothly round his neck and tightened and tightened and he could not draw his breath and then he thought voice whispered to him whispers that chilled him with horror
then it seemed to him he was on the edge of a frightful abyss holding on and struggling in mortal fear while dark hand stretched up and were pulling him over and misse_cassy came behind him laughing and pushed him
it was his mother and she turned away from him and he fell down down down amid a confused noise of shrieks and groans and shouts of demon laughter and
and then rose up that solemn veiled figure and drew aside the veil simon_legree awoke calmly the rosy hue of dawn was stealing into the room
the morning star stood with its solemn holy eye of light looking down on the man of sin from out the brightening sky
o with what freshness what solemnity and beauty is each new day born as if to say to insensate man behold
thou hast one more chance strive for immortal glory there is no speech nor language where this voice is not heard but the bold bad man heard it not
he woke with an oath and a curse what to him was the gold and purple the daily miracle of morning
what to him the sanctity of the star which the son of god has hallowed as his own emblem brute like he saw without perceiving and stumbling forward poured out a tumbler of brandy and drank half of it
i ve had a l of a night he said to misse_cassy who just then entered from an opposite door
you ll get plenty of the same sort by and by said she dryly what do you mean you minx
you ll find out one of these day returned misse_cassy in the same tone now simon_legree i ve one piece of advice to give you
the devil you have my advice is said misse_cassy steadily as she began adjusting some thing about the room that you let tom_loker alone
if you want to pay twelve hundred for a fellow and use him right up in the press of the season just to serve your own spite it no business of mine i ve done what i could for him
what business ist of yours what to be sure i dont know what it should be you have
what business have you meddling in my matter none to be sure i ve saved you some thousands of dollar at different time by taking care of your hand that
all the thanks i get if your crop comes shorter into market than any of theirs you wont lose your bet i suppose
tompkins wont lord it over you i suppose and you ll pay down your money like a lady wont you i think i see you doing it
simon_legree like many other planters had but one form of ambition to have in the heaviest crop of the season and he had several bets on this very present season pending in the next town
well i ll let him off at what he got said simon_legree but he shall beg my pardon and promise better fashions
misse_cassy therefore with woman tact touched the only string that could be made to vibrate that he wont do said misse_cassy
wont eh no he wont said misse_cassy i like to know why mistress said simon_legree in the extreme of scorn
because he done right and he knows it and wont say he done wrong who a cuss care what he knows
the nigger shall say what i please or or you ll lose your bet on the cotton crop by keeping him out of the field just at this very press
but he will give up course he will dont i know what nigger is he ll beg like a dog this morning
he wont simon_legree you dont know this kind you may kill him by inches you wont get the first word of confession out of him
simon_legree though he talked so stoutly to misse_cassy still sallied forth from the house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him
we ll see where is he said simon_legree going out in the waste room of the gin house said misse_cassy his dreams of the past night mingled with misse_cassy prudential suggestions considerably affected his mind
he resolved that nobody should be witness of his encounter with tom_loker and determined if he could not subdue him by bullying to defer his vengeance to be wreaked in a more convenient season
the solemn light of dawn the angelic glory of the morning star had looked in through the rude window of the shed where tom_loker was lying and as if descending on that star beam came the solemn word
the mysterious warnings and intimations of misse_cassy so far from discouraging his soul in the end had roused it as with a heavenly call
he did not know but that the day of his death was dawning in the sky and his heart throbbed with solemn throes of joy and desire as he thought that the wondrous all of which he had often pondered the great white throne with its ever radiant rainbow the white robed multitude with voice as many water the crowns the palms the harps might all break upon his vision before that sun should set again
i am the root and offspring of david and the bright and morning star and therefore without shuddering or trembling he heard the voice of his persecutor as he drew near
well my boy said simon_legree with a contemptuous kick how do you find yourself didnt i tell yer i could larn yer a thing or two
how do yer like it eh how did yer whaling agree with yer tom_loker ant quite so crank as ye was last night
ye couldnt treat a poor sinner now to a bit of sermon could ye eh tom_loker answered nothing get up you beast
this was a difficult matter for one so bruised and faint and as tom_loker made efforts to do so simon_legree laughed brutally
said simon_legree kicking him again what makes ye so spry this morning tom_loker cotched cold may be last night
tom_loker by this time had gained his foot and was confronting his master with a steady unmoved front the devil you can
said simon_legree looking him over i believe you havent got enough yet now tom_loker get right down on yer knees and beg my pardon for yer shines last night
tom_loker did not move down you dog said simon_legree striking him with his riding whip mas simon_legree said tom_loker i cant do it
i did only what i thought was right i shall do just so again if ever the time comes i never will do a cruel thing come what may
yes but ye dont know what may come master tom_loker ye think what you ve got is something i tell you tant anything nothingt all
how would ye like to be tied to a tree and have a slow fire lit up around ye wouldnt that be pleasant eh tom_loker
mas said tom_loker i know ye can do dreadful thing but he stretched himself upward and clasped his hand but after ye ve killed the body there ant no more ye can do
eternity the word thrilled through the black man soul with light and power as he spoke it thrilled through the sinner soul too like the bite of a scorpion
simon_legree gnashed on him with his teeth but rage kept him silent and tom_loker like a man disenthralled spoke in a clear and cheerful voice
and there all eternity to come after that mas simon_legree as ye bought me i ll be a true and faithful servant to ye
i ll give ye all the work of my hand all my time all my strength but my soul i wont give up to mortal man
i will hold on to the lord and put his commands before all die or live you may be sure ont
mas simon_legree i aint a grain afeard to die i as soon die as not ye may whip me starve me
burn me it ll only send me sooner where i want to go i ll make ye give out though fore i ve done said simon_legree in a rage
i shall have help said tom_loker you ll never do it who the devil going to help you said simon_legree scornfully
the lord almighty said tom_loker n you said simon_legree as with one blow of his fist he felled tom_loker to the earth
he turned it was misse_cassy but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before and flashing through the chambers of his brain came all the fearful images of the night watches with a portion of the horror that accompanied them
a cold soft hand fell on simon_legree at this moment will you be a fool said misse_cassy in french let him go
they say the alligator the rhinoceros though enclosed in bullet proof mail have each a spot where they are vulnerable and fierce reckless unbelieving reprobates have commonly this point in superstitious dread
let me alone to get him fit to be in the field again isnt it just as i told you simon_legree turned away determined to let the point go for the time
he said to tom_loker i wont deal with ye now because the business is pressing and i want all my hand but i never forget
well have it your own way he said doggedly to misse_cassy hark ye i ll score it against ye and sometime i ll have my pay out yer old black hide mind ye
simon_legree turned and went out there you go said misse_cassy looking darkly after him your reckoning to come yet my poor fellow how are you
the lord god hath sent his angel and shut the lion mouth for this time said tom_loker for this time to be sure said misse_cassy
but now you ve got his ill will upon you to follow you day in day out hanging like a dog on your throat sucking your blood bleeding away your life drop by drop
no matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the altar of slavery the moment he touches the sacred soil of britain the altar and the god sink together in the dust and he stands redeemed regenerated and disenthralled by the irresistible genius of universal emancipation
i know the man chapter xxxvii liberty curran john_bunyan philpot curran irish orator and judge who worked for catholic emancipation
a while we must leave tom_loker in the hand of his persecutors while we turn to pursue the fortunes of george_harris and his wife whom we left in friendly hand in a farmhouse on the road side
tom_loker we left groaning and touzling in a most immaculately clean quaker bed under the motherly supervision of aunt dorcas who found him to the full as tractable a patient as a sick bison
imagine a tall dignified spiritual woman whose clear muslin cap shades waves of silvery hair parted on a broad clear forehead which overarches thoughtful gray eye
a snowy handkerchief of lisse crape is folded neatly across her bosom her glossy brown silk dress rustles peacefully as she glides up and down the chamber
the devil says tom_loker giving a great throw to the bedclothes i must request thee thomas not to use such language says aunt dorcas as she quietly rearranged the bed
well i wont granny if i can help it says tom_loker but it is enough to make a fellow swear so cursedly hot
dorcas removed a comforter from the bed straightened the clothes again and tucked them in till tom_loker looked something like a chrysalis remarking as she did so i wish friend thee would leave off cursing and swearing and think upon thy way
what the devil said tom_loker should i think of them for last thing ever i want to think of hang it all
and tom_loker flounced over untucking and disarranging everything in a manner frightful to behold that fellow and gal are here
i pose said he sullenly after a pause they are so said dorcas they better be off up to the lake said tom_loker the quicker the better
probably they will do so said aunt dorcas knitting peacefully and hark ye said tom_loker we ve got correspondents in sandusky
that watch the boat for us i dont care if i tell now i hope they will get away just to spite marks the
cursed puppy n him thomas said dorcas i tell you granny if you bottle a fellow up too tight i shall split said tom_loker
but about the gal tell em to dress her up some way so to alter her her description out in sandusky
as we at this place take leave of tom_loker we may as well say that having lain three weeks at the quaker dwelling sick with a rheumatic fever which set in in company with his other afflictions tom_loker arose from his bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man and in place of slave catching betook himself to life in one of the new settlements where his talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears wolves and other inhabitants of the forest in which he made himself quite a name in the land
we will attend to that matter said dorcas with characteristic composure tom_loker always spoke reverently of the quakers nice people he would say wanted to convert me but couldnt come it exactly
but tell ye what stranger they do fix up a sick fellow first rate no mistake make jist the tallest kind broth and knicknacks
as tom_loker had informed them that their party would be looked for in sandusky it was thought prudent to divide them
jim_crow with his old mother was forwarded separately and a night or two after george_harris and eliza_harris with their child were driven privately into sandusky and lodged beneath a hospital roof preparatory to taking their last passage on the lake
their night was now far spent and the morning star of liberty rose fair before them electric word what is it
why man and woman of america does your heart blood thrill at that word for which your father bled and your braver mother were willing that their noblest and best should die
is there anything in it glorious and dear for a nation that is not also glorious and dear for a man
is there anything more in it than a name a rhetorical flourish what is freedom to a nation but freedom to the individuals in it
what is freedom to that young man who sits there with his arm folded over his broad chest the tint of african blood in his cheek its dark fire in his eye what is freedom to george_harris
to him it is the right of a man to be a man and not a brute the right to call the wife of his bosom his wife and to protect her from lawless violence the right to protect and educate his child the right to have a home of his own a religion of his own a character of his own unsubject to the will of another
all these thoughts were rolling and seething in george_harris breast as he was pensively leaning his head on his hand watching his wife as she was adapting to her slender and pretty form the articles of man attire in which it was deemed safest she should make her escape
now for it said she as she stood before the glass and shook down her silky abundance of black curly hair
i say george_harris it almost a pity isnt it she said as she held up some of it playfully pity it all got to come off
to your father freedom was the right of a nation to be a nation george_harris smiled sadly and made no answer
eliza_harris turned to the glass and the scissors glittered as one long lock after another was detached from her head
there now that ll do she said taking up a hair brush now for a few fancy touches there ant i a pretty young fellow
she said turning around to her husband laughing and blushing at the same time you always will be pretty do what you will said george_harris
what does make you so sober said eliza_harris kneeling on one knee and laying her hand on his we are only within twenty four hour of canada they say
only a day and a night on the lake and then oh then eliza_harris said george_harris drawing her towards him that is it
now my fate is all narrowing down to a point to come so near to be almost in sight and then lose all
i should never live under it eliza_harris dont fear said his wife hopefully the good lord would not have brought us so far if he didnt mean to carry us through
i seem to feel him with us george_harris you are a blessed woman eliza_harris said george_harris clasping her with a convulsive grasp
but oh tell me can this great mercy be for us will these year and year of misery come to an end shall
i am sure of it george_harris said eliza_harris looking upward while tear of hope and enthusiasm shone on her long dark lashes
we be free i feel it in me that god is going to bring us out of bondage this very day
well indeed said he holding her off at arm length and looking admiringly at her you are a pretty little fellow
i will believe you eliza_harris said george_harris rising suddenly up i will believe come let be off that crop of little short curls is quite becoming
put on your cap so a little to one side i never saw you look quite so pretty but it almost time for the carriage i wonder if mrs smyth has got harry rigged
the door opened and a respectable middle aged woman entered leading little harry dressed in girl clothes what a pretty girl he makes said eliza_harris turning him round
the child stood gravely regarding his mother in her new and strange attire observing a profound silence and occasionally drawing deep sighs and peeping at her from under his dark curls
we call him harriet you see dont the name come nicely does harry know mamma said eliza_harris stretching her hand toward him
come eliza_harris why do you try to coax him when you know that he has got to be kept away from you
the child clung shyly to the woman i know it foolish said eliza_harris yet i cant bear to have him turn away from me
but come where my cloak here how is it man put on cloaks george_harris you must wear it so said her husband throwing it over his shoulders
so then said eliza_harris imitating the motion and i must stamp and take long steps and try to look saucy
there is now and then a modest young man and i think it would be easier for you to act that character
dont exert yourself said george_harris and these gloves mercy upon us said eliza_harris why my hand are lost in them
i advise you to keep them on pretty strictly said george_harris your slender paw might bring us all out
i ve heard said mrs smyth that there have been man down warning all the packet captains against a man and woman with a little boy
now mrs smyth you are to go under our charge and be our aunty you mind they have said george_harris
a hack now drove to the door and the friendly family who had received the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings
well if we see any such people we can tell them the disguises the party had assumed were in accordance with the hints of tom_loker
mrs smyth a respectable woman from the settlement in canada whither they were fleeing being fortunately about crossing the lake to return thither had consented to appear as the aunt of little harry and in order to attach him to her he had been allowed to remain the two last day under her sole charge and an extra amount of petting jointed to an indefinite amount of seed cakes and candy had cemented a very close attachment on the part of the young gentleman
the two young man as they appeared walked up the plank into the boat eliza_harris gallantly giving her arm to mrs smyth and george_harris attending to their baggage
the hack drove to the wharf george_harris was standing at the captain office settling for his party when he overheard two man talking by his side
i ve watched every one that came on board said one and i know they re not on this boat the voice was that of the clerk of the boat
the speaker whom he addressed was our sometime friend marks who with that valuable perseverance which characterized him had come on to sandusky seeking whom he might devour
you would scarcely know the woman from a white one said marks the man is a very light mulatto he has a brand in one of his hand
the hand with which george_harris was taking the tickets and change trembled a little but he turned coolly around fixed an unconcerned glance on the face of the speaker and walked leisurely toward another part of the boat where eliza_harris stood waiting for him
mrs smyth with little harry sought the seclusion of the lady cabin where the dark beauty of the supposed little girl drew many flattering comments from the passengers
george_harris had the satisfaction as the bell rang out its farewell peal to see marks walk down the plank to the shore and drew a long sigh of relief when the boat had put a returnless distance between them
it was a superb day the blue waves of lake erie danced rippling and sparkling in the sun light a fresh breeze blew from the shore and the lordly boat ploughed her way right gallantly onward
who thought as george_harris walked calmly up and down the deck of the steamer with his shy companion at his side of all that was burning in his bosom
the mighty good that seemed approaching seemed too good too fair even to be a reality and he felt a jealous dread every moment of the day that something would rise to snatch it from him
o what an untold world there is in one human heart but the boat swept on hour fleeted and at last clear and full rose the blessed english shores
shores charmed by a mighty spell with one touch to dissolve every incantation of slavery no matter in what language pronounced or by what national power confirmed
his breath grew thick and short a mist gathered before his eye he silently pressed the little hand that lay trembling on his arm
george_harris and his wife stood arm in arm as the boat neared the small town of amherstberg in canada the bell rang the boat stopped
scarcely seeing what he did he looked out his baggage and gathered his little party the little company were landed on the shore
they stood still till the boat had cleared and then with tear and embracings the husband and wife with their wondering child in their arm knelt down and lifted up their heart to god
t was something like the burst from death to life from the grave cerements to the robes of heaven from sin dominion and from passion strife to the pure freedom of a soul forgiven where all the bonds of death and hell are riven and mortal puts on immortality when mercy hand hath turned the golden key and mercy voice hath said rejoice thy soul is free
the little party were soon guided by mrs smyth to the hospitable abode of a good missionary whom christian charity has placed here as a shepherd to the outcast and wandering who are constantly finding an asylum on this shore
who can speak the blessedness of that first day of freedom is not the sense of liberty a higher and a finer one than any of the five
who can speak the blessings of that rest which comes down on the free man pillow under law which insure to him the rights that god has given to man
to move speak and breathe go out and come in unwatched and free from danger how fair and precious to that mother was that sleeping child face endeared by the memory of a thousand dangers
how impossible was it to sleep in the exuberant possession of such blessedness and yet these two had not one acre of ground not
they had nothing more than the birds of the air or the flowers of the field yet they could not sleep for joy
a roof that they could call their own they had spent their all to the last dollar ye who take freedom from man with what word shall ye answer it to god
have not many of us in the weary way of life felt in some hour how far easier it were to die than to live
the martyr when faced even by a death of bodily anguish and horror finds in the very terror of his doom a strong stimulant and tonic
there is a vivid excitement a thrill and fervor which may carry through any crisis of suffering that is the birth hour of eternal glory and rest
but to live to wear on day after day of mean bitter low harassing servitude every nerve dampened and depressed every power of feeling gradually smothered this long and wasting heart martyrdom this slow daily bleeding away of the inward life drop by drop hour after hour this is the true searching test of what there may be in man or woman
when tom_loker stood face to face with his persecutor and heard his threats and thought in his very soul that his hour was come his heart swelled bravely in him and he thought he could bear torture and fire bear anything with the vision of lord_jesus and heaven but just a step beyond but when he was gone and the present excitement passed off came back the pain of his bruised and weary limbs came back the sense of his utterly degraded hopeless forlorn estate and the day passed wearily enough
long before his wounds were healed simon_legree insisted that he should be put to the regular field work and then came day after day of pain and weariness aggravated by every kind of injustice and indignity that the ill will of a mean and malicious mind could devise
whoever in our circumstances has made trial of pain even with all the alleviations which for us usually attend it must know the irritation that comes with it
tom_loker no longer wondered at the habitual surliness of his associates nay he found the placid sunny temper which had been the habitude of his life broken in on and sorely strained by the inroads of the same thing
chapter xxxviii the victory thanks be unto god who giveth us the victory i cor he had flattered himself on leisure to read his bible but there was no such thing as leisure there
why shouldnt he he made more cotton by it and gained his wager and if it wore out a few more hand he could buy better one
at first tom_loker used to read a verse or two of his bible by the flicker of the fire after he had returned from his daily toil but after the cruel treatment he received he used to come home so exhausted that his head swam and his eye failed when he tried to read and he was fain to stretch himself down with the others in utter exhaustion
is it strange that the religious peace and trust which had upborne him hitherto should give way to tossings of soul and despondent darkness
in the height of the season simon_legree did not hesitate to press all his hand through sundays and week day alike the gloomiest problem of this mysterious life was constantly before his eye soul crushed and ruined evil triumphant and god silent
it was weeks and months that tom_loker wrestled in his own soul in darkness and sorrow he thought of miss_ophelia letter to his kentucky friend and would pray earnestly that god would send him deliverance
and then he would watch day after day in the vague hope of seeing somebody sent to redeem him and when nobody came he would crush back to his soul bitter thoughts that it was vain to serve god that god had forgotten him
he sometimes saw misse_cassy and sometimes when summoned to the house caught a glimpse of the dejected form of emmeline but held very little communion with either in fact there was no time for him to commune with anybody
one evening he was sitting in utter dejection and prostration by a few decaying brands where his coarse supper was baking
he put a few bits of brushwood on the fire and strove to raise the light and then drew his worn bible from his pocket
there were all the marked passages which had thrilled his soul so often word of patriarchs and seers poets and sages who from early time had spoken courage to man voice from the great cloud of witnesses who ever surround us in the race of life
had the word lost its power or could the failing eye and weary sense no longer answer to the touch of that mighty inspiration
heavily sighing he put it in his pocket a coarse laugh roused him he looked up simon_legree was standing opposite to him
well old boy he said you find your religion dont work it seems i thought i should get that through your wool at last
the cruel taunt was more than hunger and cold and nakedness tom_loker was silent you were a fool said simon_legree for i meant to do well by you when i bought you
you might have been better off than sambo or quimbo either and had easy time and instead of getting cut up and thrashed every day or two ye might have had liberty to lord it round and cut up the other nigger and ye might have had now and then a good warming of whiskey punch
come tom_loker dont you think you better be reasonable heave that ar old pack of trash in the fire and join my church
the lord forbid said tom_loker fervently you see the lord ant going to help you if he had been he wouldnt have let me get you
this yer religion is all a mess of lying trumpery tom_loker i know all about it ye better hold to me i somebody and can do something
no mas said tom_loker i ll hold on the lord may help me or not help but i ll hold to him and believe him to the last
the more fool you said simon_legree spitting scornfully at him and spurning him with his foot never mind i ll chase you down yet and bring you under you ll see and simon_legree turned away
when a heavy weight presses the soul to the lowest level at which endurance is possible there is an instant and desperate effort of every physical and moral nerve to throw off the weight and hence the heaviest anguish often precedes a return tide of joy and courage
the atheistic taunts of his cruel master sunk his before dejected soul to the lowest ebb and though the hand of faith still held to the eternal rock it was a numb despairing grasp
suddenly everything around him seemed to fade and a vision rose before him of one crowned with thorns buffeted and bleeding
tom_loker gazed in awe and wonder at the majestic patience of the face the deep pathetic eye thrilled him to his inmost heart his soul woke as with floods of emotion he stretched out his hand and fell upon his knees when gradually the vision changed the sharp thorns became rays of glory and in splendor inconceivable he saw that same face bending compassionately towards him and a voice said he that overcometh shall sit down with me on my throne even as i also overcome and am set down with my father on his throne
so was it now with tom_loker tom sat like one stunned at the fire how long tom_loker lay there he knew not
when he came to himself the fire was gone out his clothes were wet with the chill and drenching dews but the dread soul crisis was past and in the joy that filled him he no longer felt hunger cold degradation disappointment wretchedness
from his deepest soul he that hour loosed and parted from every hope in life that now is and offered his own will an unquestioning sacrifice to the infinite
tom_loker looked up to the silent ever living stars types of the angelic hosts who ever look down on man and the solitude of the night rung with the triumphant word of a hymn which he had sung often in happier day but never with such feeling as now
the earth shall be dissolved like snow the sun shall cease to shine but god who called me here below shall be forever mine
and when this mortal life shall fail and flesh and sense shall cease i shall possess within the veil a life of joy and peace
when we ve been there ten thousand year bright shining like the sun we ve no less day to sing god praise
those who have been familiar with the religious histories of the slave population know that relations like what we have narrated are very common among them
than when we first begun we have heard some from their own lips of a very touching and affecting character
the psychologist tells us of a state in which the affections and images of the mind become so dominant and overpowering that they press into their service the outward imagining
who shall measure what an all pervading spirit may do with these capabilities of our mortality or the way in which he may encourage the desponding soul of the desolate
did he not say that his mission in all ages was to bind up the broken hearted and set at liberty them that are bruised
when the dim gray of dawn woke the slumberers to go forth to the field there was among those tattered and shivering wretches one who walked with an exultant tread for firmer than the ground he trod on was his strong faith in almighty eternal love
if the poor forgotten slave believes that lord_jesus hath appeared and spoken to him who shall contradict him ah simon_legree try all your forces now
utmost agony woe degradation want and loss of all thing shall only hasten on the process by which he shall be made a king and a priest unto god
from this time an inviolable sphere of peace encompassed the lowly heart of the oppressed one an ever present saviour hallowed it as a temple
past now the bleeding of earthly regrets past its fluctuations of hope and fear and desire the human will bent and bleeding and struggling long was now entirely merged in the divine
so short now seemed the remaining voyage of life so near so vivid seemed eternal blessedness that life uttermost woes fell from him unharming
cheerfulness and alertness seemed to return to him and a quietness which no insult or injury could ruffle seemed to possess him
all noticed the change in his appearance what the devil got into tom_loker simon_legree said to sambo a while ago he was all down in the mouth and now he peart as a cricket
dunno mas gwine to run off mebbe like to see him try that said simon_legree with a savage grin wouldnt we sambo
guess we would haw haw ho said the sooty gnome laughing obsequiously lord de fun to see him stickin in de mud chasin and tarin through de bushes dog a holdin on to him
lord i laughed fit to split dat ar time we cotched molly i thought they a had her all stripped up afore
i could get em off she car de marks dat ar spree yet i reckon she will to her grave said simon_legree
but now sambo you look sharp if the nigger got anything of this sort going trip him up mas let me lone for dat said sambo i ll tree de coon
that night as he was returning he thought he would turn his horse and ride round the quarters and see if all was safe
it was a superb moonlight night and the shadows of the graceful china trees lay minutely pencilled on the turf below and there was that transparent stillness in the air which it seems almost unholy to disturb
ho ho ho this was spoken as simon_legree was getting on his horse to go to the neighboring town simon_legree was a little distance from the quarters when he heard the voice of some one singing
a musical tenor voice sang when i can read my title clear to mansions in the skies i ll bid farewell to every fear and wipe my weeping eye should earth against my soul engage
it was not a usual sound there and he paused to listen and hellish darts be hurled then i can smile at satan rage and face a frowning world
let care like a wild deluge come and storms of sorrow fall may i but safely reach my home my god my heaven my all
on my journey home hymn by isaac watts found in many of the southern country songbooks of the ante bellum period
so ho said simon_legree to himself he thinks so does he how i hate these cursed methodist hymns
here you nigger said he coming suddenly out upon tom_loker and raising his riding whip how dare you be gettin up this yer row when you ought to be in bed
shut yer old black gash and get along in with you yes mas said tom_loker with ready cheerfulness as he rose to go in
simon_legree was provoked beyond measure by tom_loker evident happiness and riding up to him belabored him over his head and shoulders
there you dog he said see if you ll feel so comfortable after that but the blows fell now only on the outer man and not as before on the heart
tom_loker stood perfectly submissive and yet simon_legree could not hide from himself that his power over his bond thrall was somehow gone
there passed through his mind one of those vivid flashes that often send the lightning of conscience across the dark and wicked soul
and as tom_loker disappeared in his cabin and he wheeled his horse suddenly round he understood full well that it was god who was standing between him and his victim and he blasphemed him
that submissive and silent man whom taunts nor threats nor stripes nor cruelties could disturb roused a voice within him such as of old his master roused in the demoniac soul saying what have we to do with thee thou lord_jesus of nazareth art thou come to torment us before the time
to him it seemed as if his life sorrows were now over and as if out of that strange treasury of peace and joy with which he had been endowed from above he longed to pour out something for the relief of their woes
it is true opportunities were scanty but on the way to the fields and back again and during the hour of labor chances fell in his way of extending a helping hand to the weary the disheartened and discouraged
the poor worn down brutalized creature at first could scarce comprehend this but when it was continued week after week and month after month it began to awaken long silent chords in their benumbed heart
gradually and imperceptibly the strange silent patient man who was ready to bear every one burden and sought help from none who stood aside for all and came last and took least yet was foremost to share his little all with any who needed the man who in cold night would give up his tattered blanket to add to the comfort of some woman who shivered with sickness and who filled the baskets of the weaker one in the field at the terrible risk of coming short in his own measure and who though pursued with unrelenting cruelty by their common tyrant never joined in uttering a word of reviling or cursing this man at last began to have a strange power over them and when the more pressing season was past and they were allowed again their sundays for their own use many would gather together to hear from him of lord_jesus
they would gladly have met to hear and pray and sing in some place together but simon_legree would not permit it and more than once broke up such attempts with oaths and brutal execrations so that the blessed news had to circulate from individual to individual
yet who can speak the simple joy with which some of those poor outcasts to whom life was a joyless journey to a dark unknown heard of a compassionate redeemer and a heavenly home
it is the statement of missionaries that of all race of the earth none have received the gospel with such eager docility as the african
the principle of reliance and unquestioning faith which is its foundation is more a native element in this race than any other and it has often been found among them that a stray seed of truth borne on some breeze of accident into heart the most ignorant has sprung up into fruit whose abundance has shamed that of higher and more skilful culture
the poor mulatto woman whose simple faith had been well nigh crushed and overwhelmed by the avalanche of cruelty and wrong which had fallen upon her felt her soul raised up by the hymns and passages of holy writ which this lowly missionary breathed into her ear in intervals as they were going to and returning from work and even the half crazed and wandering mind of misse_cassy was soothed and calmed by his simple and unobtrusive influences
stung to madness and despair by the crushing agonies of a life misse_cassy had often resolved in her soul an hour of retribution when her hand should avenge on her oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to which she had been witness or which she had in her own person suffered
one night after all in tom_loker cabin were sunk in sleep he was suddenly aroused by seeing her face at the hole between the logs that served for a window
tom_loker whole soul overflowed with compassion and sympathy for the poor wretches by whom he was surrounded she made a silent gesture for him to come out
tom_loker remarked as the light of the moon fell upon misse_cassy large black eye that there was a wild and peculiar glare in them unlike their wonted fixed despair
come here father tom_loker she said laying her small hand on his wrist and drawing him forward with a force as if the hand were of steel come here i ve news for you
tom_loker came out the door it was between one and two clock at night broad calm still moonlight what misse_cassy
said tom_loker anxiously tom_loker wouldnt you like your liberty i shall have it misse_cassy in god time said tom_loker
ay but you may have it tonight said misse_cassy with a flash of sudden energy come on tom_loker hesitated come
said she in a whisper fixing her black eye on him come along he asleep sound i put enough into his brandy to keep him so
i wish i had more i shouldnt have wanted you but come the back door is unlocked there an axe there i put it there his room door is open i ll show you the way
i a done it myself only my arm are so weak come along not for ten thousand world misse_cassy said tom_loker firmly stopping and holding her back as she was pressing forward
we might set them all free and go somewhere in the swamps and find an island and live by ourselves i ve heard of its being done
but think of all these poor creature said misse_cassy any life is better than this no said tom_loker firmly
no good never comes of wickedness i sooner chop my right hand off then i shall do it said misse_cassy turning
said tom_loker throwing himself before her for the dear lord sake that died for ye dont sell your precious soul to the devil that way
misse_cassy nothing but evil will come of it the lord hasnt called us to wrath we must suffer and wait his time
wait said misse_cassy havent i waited waited till my head is dizzy and my heart sick what has he made me suffer
what has he made hundreds of poor creature suffer isnt he wringing the life blood out of you i called on they call me
his time come and i ll have his heart blood no no no said tom_loker holding her small hand which were clenched with spasmodic violence
the dear blessed lord never shed no blood but his own and that he poured out for us when we was enemies
no ye poor lost soul that ye mustnt do lord help us to follow his steps and love our enemies
love said misse_cassy with a fierce glare love such enemies it isnt in flesh and blood no misse_cassy it isnt said tom_loker looking up but he gives it to us and that the victory
when we can love and pray over all and through all the battle past and the victory come glory be to god
latest called of nations called to the crown of thorns the scourge the bloody sweat the cross of agony this is to be thy victory by this shalt thou reign with jesus_christ when his kingdom shall come on earth
the deep fervor of tom_loker feeling the softness of his voice his tear fell like dew on the wild unsettled spirit of the poor woman
a softness gathered over the lurid fire of her eye she looked down and tom_loker could feel the relaxing muscles of her hand as she said didnt i tell you that evil spirit followed me
and with streaming eye and choking voice the black man looked up to heaven and this oh africa father tom_loker i cant pray i wish i could
i never have prayed since my child were sold what you say must be right i know it must but when i try to pray i can only hate and curse
i cant pray poor soul said tom_loker compassionately satan desires to have ye and sift ye as wheat i pray the lord for ye
o misse_cassy turn to the dear lord_jesus he came to bind up the broken hearted and comfort all that mourn
misse_cassy said tom_loker in a hesitating tone after surveying her in silence if ye only could get away from here if
misse_cassy stood silent while large heavy tear dropped from her downcast eye the thing was possible i vise ye and emmeline to do it that is if ye could go without blood guiltiness not otherwise
no said tom_loker time was when i would but the lord given me a work among these yer poor soul and i ll stay with em and bear my cross with em till the end
would you try it with us father tom_loker it different with you it a snare to you it more you can stand and
there no beast or mrs_bird but can find a home some where even the snakes and the alligators have their place to lie down and be quiet but there no place for us
you better go if you can i know no way but through the grave said misse_cassy down in the darkest swamps their dog will hunt us out and find us
tom_loker stood silent at length he said him that saved daniel in the den of lions that saved the child in the fiery furnace him that walked on the sea and bade the winds be still he alive yet and i ve faith to believe he can deliver you
everybody and everything is against us even the very beasts side against us and where shall we go try it and i ll pray with all my might for you
by what strange law of mind is it that an idea long overlooked and trodden under foot as a useless stone suddenly sparkles out in new light as a discovered diamond
misse_cassy had often revolved for hour all possible or probable schemes of escape and dismissed them all as hopeless and impracticable but at this moment there flashed through her mind a plan so simple and feasible in all its details as to awaken an instant hope
father tom_loker i ll try it she said suddenly amen said tom_loker the lord help ye chapter xxxix
the stratagem the way of the wicked is as darkness he knoweth not at what he stumbleth prov
the garret of the house that simon_legree occupied like most other garrets was a great desolate space dusty hung with cobwebs and littered with cast off lumber
the opulent family that had inhabited the house in the day of its splendor had imported a great deal of splendid furniture some of which they had taken away with them while some remained standing desolate in mouldering unoccupied room or stored away in this place
there was a small window there which let in through its dingy dusty panes a scanty uncertain light on the tall high backed chair and dusty table that had once seen better day
altogether it was a weird and ghostly place but ghostly as it was it wanted not in legends among the superstitious negroes to increase its terrors
one or two immense packing boxes in which this furniture was brought stood against the side of the garret some few year before a negro woman who had incurred simon_legree displeasure was confined there for several weeks
what passed there we do not say the negroes used to whisper darkly to each other but it was known that the body of the unfortunate creature was one day taken down from there and buried and after that it was said that oaths and cursings and the sound of violent blows used to ring through that old garret and mingled with wailings and groans of despair
once when simon_legree chanced to overhear something of this kind he flew into a violent passion and swore that the next one that told stories about that garret should have an opportunity of knowing what was there for he would chain them up there for a week
this hint was enough to repress talking though of course it did not disturb the credit of the story in the least
gradually the staircase that led to the garret and even the passage way to the staircase were avoided by every one in the house from every one fearing to speak of it and the legend was gradually falling into desuetude
it had suddenly occurred to misse_cassy to make use of the superstitious excitability which was so great in simon_legree for the purpose of her liberation and that of her fellow sufferer
one day without consulting simon_legree she suddenly took it upon her with some considerable ostentation to change all the furniture and appurtenances of the room to one at some considerable distance
the under servant who were called on to effect this movement were running and bustling about with great zeal and confusion when simon_legree returned from a ride
the sleeping room of misse_cassy was directly under the garret hallo you cass said simon_legree what in the wind now
nothing only i choose to have another room said misse_cassy doggedly and what for pray said simon_legree i choose to said misse_cassy
the devil you do and what for i like to get some sleep now and then sleep well what hinders your sleeping
i could tell i suppose if you want to hear said misse_cassy dryly speak out you minx said simon_legree
o nothing i suppose it wouldnt disturb you only groans and people scuffing and rolling round on the garret floor half the night from twelve to morning
misse_cassy raised her sharp black eye and looked in the face of simon_legree with an expression that went through his bones as she said to be sure simon_legree who are they
people up garret said simon_legree uneasily but forcing a laugh who are they misse_cassy i like to have you tell me
with an oath simon_legree struck at her with his riding whip but she glided to one side and passed through the door and looking back said if you ll sleep in that room you ll know all about it
simon_legree blustered and swore and threatened to break down the door but apparently thought better of it and walked uneasily into the sitting room
misse_cassy perceived that her shaft had struck home and from that hour with the most exquisite address she never ceased to continue the train of influences she had begun
in a knot hole of the garret that had opened she had inserted the neck of an old bottle in such a manner that when there was the least wind most doleful and lugubrious wailing sounds proceeded from it which in a high wind increased to a perfect shriek such as to credulous and superstitious ear might easily seem to be that of horror and despair
these sounds were from time to time heard by the servant and revived in full force the memory of the old ghost legend
a superstitious creeping horror seemed to fill the house and though no one dared to breathe it to simon_legree he found himself encompassed by it as by an atmosphere
you dont know i suppose perhaps you better try it and then immediately she shut and locked the door no one is so thoroughly superstitious as the godless man
the christian is composed by the belief of a wise all ruling father whose presence fills the void unknown with light and order but to the man who has dethroned god the spirit land is indeed in the word of the hebrew poet a land of darkness and the shadow of death without any order where the light is as darkness
simon_legree had had the slumbering moral elements in him roused by his encounters with tom_loker roused only to be resisted by the determinate force of evil but still there was a thrill and commotion of the dark inner world produced by every word or prayer or hymn that reacted in superstitious dread
life and death to him are haunted grounds filled with goblin form of vague and shadowy dread the influence of misse_cassy over him was of a strange and singular kind
she was as he knew wholly and without any possibility of help or redress in his hand and yet so it is that the most brutal man cannot live in constant association with a strong female influence and not be greatly controlled by it
when he first bought her she was as she said a woman delicately bred and then he crushed her without scruple beneath the foot of his brutality
but as time and debasing influences and despair hardened womanhood within her and waked the fire of fiercer passions she had become in a measure his mistress and he alternately tyrannized over and dreaded her
this influence had become more harassing and decided since partial insanity had given a strange weird unsettled cast to all her word and language
a night or two after this simon_legree was sitting in the old sitting room by the side of a flickering wood fire
he was her owner her tyrant and tormentor that threw uncertain glances round the room it was a stormy windy night such as raises whole squadrons of nondescript noises in rickety old house
window were rattling shutters flapping and wind carousing rumbling and tumbling down the chimney and every once in a while puffing out smoke and ashes as if a legion of spirit were coming after them
simon_legree had been casting up accounts and reading newspapers for some hour while misse_cassy sat in the corner sullenly looking into the fire
simon_legree laid down his paper and seeing an old book lying on the table which he had noticed misse_cassy reading the first part of the evening took it up and began to turn it over
it was one of those collections of stories of bloody murders ghostly legends and supernatural visitations which coarsely got up and illustrated have a strange fascination for one who once begins to read them
simon_legree poohed and pished but read turning page after page till finally after reading some way he threw down the book with an oath
you dont believe in ghosts do you cass said he taking the tongs and settling the fire i thought you more sense than to let noises scare you
no matter what i believe said misse_cassy sullenly fellow used to try to frighten me with their yarns at sea said simon_legree
never come it round me that way i too tough for any such trash tell ye misse_cassy sat looking intensely at him in the shadow of the corner
there was that strange light in her eye that always impressed simon_legree with uneasiness them noises was nothing but rats and the wind said simon_legree
rats will make a devil of a noise i used to hear em sometimes down in the hold of the ship and wind lord sake
misse_cassy knew simon_legree was uneasy under her eye and therefore she made no answer but sat fixing them on him with that strange unearthly expression as before
can rats walk down stairs and come walking through the entry and open a door when you ve locked it and set a chair against it said misse_cassy and come walk walk walking right up to your bed and put out their hand so
misse_cassy kept her glittering eye fixed on simon_legree as she spoke and he stared at her like a man in the nightmare till when she finished by laying her hand icy cold on his he sprung back with an oath
ye can make anything out wind come speak out woman dont you think so said simon_legree woman
what do you mean nobody did no of course not did i say they did said misse_cassy with a smile of chilling derision
but did have you really seen come cass what is it now speak out you may sleep there yourself said misse_cassy if you want to know
did it come from the garret misse_cassy it what said misse_cassy why what you told of i didnt tell you anything said misse_cassy with dogged sullenness
simon_legree walked up and down the room uneasily i ll have this yer thing examined i ll look into it this very night
i ll take my pistols do said misse_cassy sleep in that room i like to see you doing it fire your pistols do
simon_legree stamped his foot and swore violently dont swear said misse_cassy nobody knows who may be hearing you hark
what was that what said simon_legree starting a heavy old dutch clock that stood in the corner of the room began and slowly struck twelve
for some reason or other simon_legree neither spoke nor moved a vague horror fell on him while misse_cassy with a keen sneering glitter in her eye stood looking at him counting the strokes
twelve clock well now we ll see said she turning and opening the door into the passage way and standing as if listening
hark what that said she raising her finger it only the wind said simon_legree dont you hear how cursedly it blows
simon_legree come here said misse_cassy in a whisper laying her hand on his and leading him to the foot of the stairs do you know what that is
hark a wild shriek came pealing down the stairway it came from the garret simon_legree knees knocked together his face grew white with fear
hadnt you better get your pistols said misse_cassy with a sneer that froze simon_legree blood it time this thing was looked into you know
i like to have you go up now they re at it i wont go said simon_legree with an oath
why not there ant any such thing as ghosts you know come and misse_cassy flitted up the winding stairway laughing and looking back after him
come on i believe you are the devil said simon_legree come back you hag come back cass you shant go but misse_cassy laughed wildly and fled on
a wild gust of wind swept down extinguishing the candle he held in his hand and with it the fearful unearthly screams they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear
simon_legree fled frantically into the parlor whither in a few moment he was followed by misse_cassy pale calm cold as an avenging spirit and with that same fearful light in her eye
he heard her open the entry door that led to the garret i hope you are satisfied said she
blast you cass said simon_legree what for said misse_cassy i only went up and shut the door what the matter with that garret simon_legree do you suppose said she
none of your business said simon_legree it ant well said misse_cassy at any rate i glad i dont sleep under it
anticipating the rising of the wind that very evening misse_cassy had been up and opened the garret window of course the moment the door were opened the wind had drafted down and extinguished the light
this may serve as a specimen of the game that misse_cassy played with simon_legree until he would sooner have put his head into a lion mouth than to have explored that garret
meanwhile in the night when everybody else was asleep misse_cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time she transferred article by article a greater part of her own and emmeline wardrobe
by cajoling simon_legree and taking advantage of a good natured interval misse_cassy had got him to take her with him to the neighboring town which was situated directly on the red river
with a memory sharpened to almost preternatural clearness she remarked every turn in the road and formed a mental estimate of the time to be occupied in traversing it
at the time when all was matured for action our readers may perhaps like to look behind the scenes and see the final coup etat
all thing being arranged they only waited a fitting opportunity to put their plan in execution it was now near evening simon_legree had been absent on a ride to a neighboring farm
for many day misse_cassy had been unusually gracious and accommodating in her humors and simon_legree and she had been apparently on the best of terms
at present we may behold her and emmeline in the room of the latter busy in sorting and arranging two small bundles
there these will be large enough said misse_cassy now put on your bonnet and let start it just about the right time
why they can see us yet said emmeline i mean they shall said misse_cassy coolly dont you know that they must have their chase after us at any rate
the way of the thing is to be just this we will steal out of the back door and run down by the quarters
they will give chase and we will get into the swamp then they cant follow us any further till they go up and give the alarm and turn out the dog and so on and while they are blundering round and tumbling over each other as they always do you and i will slip along to the creek that runs back of the house and wade along in it till we get opposite the back door
sambo or quimbo will be sure to see us that will put the dog all at fault for scent wont lie in the water
every one will run out of the house to look after us and then we ll whip in at the back door and up into the garret where i ve got a nice bed made up in one of the great boxes
we must stay in that garret a good while for i tell you he will raise heaven and earth after us
he ll muster some of those old overseers on the other plantation and have a great hunt and they ll go over every inch of ground in that swamp
he makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him so let him hunt at his leisure misse_cassy how well you have planned it said emmeline
who ever would have thought of it but you there was neither pleasure nor exultation in misse_cassy eye only a despairing firmness
come she said reaching her hand to emmeline the two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house and flitted through the gathering shadows of evening along by the quarters
as misse_cassy expected when quite near the verge of the swamps that encircled the plantation they heard a voice calling to them to stop
the crescent moon set like a silver signet in the western sky delayed a little the approach of night it was not sambo however but
at the sound the feebler spirit of emmeline gave way and laying hold of misse_cassy arm she said misse_cassy i going to faint
if you do i ll kill you said misse_cassy drawing a small glittering stiletto and flashing it before the eye of the girl
emmeline did not faint and succeeded in plunging with misse_cassy into a part of the labyrinth of swamp so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for simon_legree to think of following them without assistance
simon_legree who was pursuing them with violent execrations the diversion accomplished the purpose well said he chuckling brutally at any rate they ve got themselves into a trap now the baggage
they re safe enough they shall sweat for it hulloa there sambo quimbo all hand called simon_legree coming to the quarters when the man and woman were just returning from work
there two runaways in the swamps i ll give five dollar to any nigger as catches em turn out the dog
many of the man sprang forward officiously to offer their services either from the hope of the reward or from that cringing subserviency which is one of the most baleful effects of slavery
turn out tiger and fury and the rest the sensation produced by this news was immediate some ran one way and some another
some were for getting flambeaux of pine knots some were uncoupling the dog whose hoarse savage bay added not a little to the animation of the scene
mas shall we shoot em if cant cotch em said sambo to whom his master brought out a rifle
you may fire on cass if you like it time she was gone to the devil where she belongs but the gal not said simon_legree
and now boy be spry and smart five dollar for him that gets em and a glass of spirit to every one of you anyhow
the whole band with the glare of blazing torches and whoop and shout and savage yell of man and beast proceeded down to the swamp followed at some distance by every servant in the house
the whooping and shouts of their pursuers were still filling the air and looking from the sitting room window misse_cassy and emmeline could see the troop with their flambeaux just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp
the establishment was of a consequence wholly deserted when misse_cassy and emmeline glided into it the back way see there said emmeline pointing to misse_cassy the hunt is begun
look how those light dance about hark the dog dont you hear if we were only there our chances wouldnt be worth a picayune
o for pity sake do let hide ourselves quick there no occasion for hurry said misse_cassy coolly they are all out after the hunt that the amusement of the evening
meanwhile said she deliberately taking a key from the pocket of a coat that simon_legree had thrown down in his hurry meanwhile i shall take something to pay our passage
we ll go up stairs by and by she unlocked the desk took from it a roll of bills which she counted over rapidly
dont let do that said emmeline dont said misse_cassy why not would you have us starve in the swamps or have that that will pay our way to the free state
money will do anything girl and as she spoke she put the money in her bosom it would be stealing said emmeline in a distressed whisper
every one of these bills is stolen stolen from poor starving sweating creature who must go to the devil at last for his profit
stealing said misse_cassy with a scornful laugh they who steal body and soul neednt talk to us let him talk about stealing
but come we may as well go up garret i ve got a stock of candles there and some book to pass away the time
you may be pretty sure they wont come there to inquire after us if they do i ll play ghost for them
when emmeline reached the garret she found an immense box in which some heavy pieces of furniture had once been brought turned on its side so that the opening faced the wall or rather the eaves
it was spread with a couple of small mattresses and some pillows a box near by was plentifully stored with candles provisions and all the clothing necessary to their journey which misse_cassy had arranged into bundles of an astonishingly small compass
there said misse_cassy as she fixed the lamp into a small hook which she had driven into the side of the box for that purpose this is to be our home for the present
misse_cassy lit a small lamp and creeping round under the eaves they established themselves in it how do you like it
are you sure they wont come and search the garret i like to see simon_legree doing that said misse_cassy
no indeed he will be too glad to keep away as to the servant they would any of them stand and be shot sooner than show their face here
somewhat reassured emmeline settled herself back on her pillow what did you mean misse_cassy by saying you would kill me
she said simply i meant to stop your fainting said misse_cassy and i did do it and now i tell you emmeline you must make up your mind not to faint let what will come
there no sort of need of it if i had not stopped you that wretch might have had his hand on you now
emmeline shuddered the two remained some time in silence misse_cassy busied herself with a french book emmeline overcome with the exhaustion fell into a doze and slept some time
she was awakened by loud shouts and outcries the tramp of horse foot and the baying of dog she started up with a faint shriek
only the hunt coming back said misse_cassy coolly never fear look out of this knot hole dont you see em all down there
simon_legree has to give up for this night look how muddy his horse is flouncing about in the swamp the dog too look rather crestfallen
ah my good sir you ll have to try the race again and again the game isnt there dont speak a word said emmeline what if they should hear you
if they do hear anything it will make them very particular to keep away said misse_cassy no danger we may make any noise we please and it will only add to the effect
at length the stillness of midnight settled down over the house simon_legree cursing his ill luck and vowing dire vengeance on the morrow went to bed
chapter xl the martyr deem not the just by heaven forgot though life its common gifts deny though with a crushed and bleeding heart and spurned of man he goes to die
for god hath marked each sorrowing day and numbered every bitter tear and heaven long year of bliss shall pay for all his child suffer here
this poem does not appear in the collected work of william cullen bryant nor in the collected poems of his brother john_bunyan howard bryant
bryant it was probably copied from a newspaper or magazine the longest way must have its close the gloomiest night will wear on to a morning
an eternal inexorable lapse of moment is ever hurrying the day of the evil to an eternal night and the night of the just to an eternal day
we have walked with our humble friend thus far in the valley of slavery first through flowery fields of ease and indulgence then through heart breaking separations from all that man holds dear
again we have waited with him in a sunny island where generous hand concealed his chains with flowers and lastly we have followed him when the last ray of earthly hope went out in night and seen how in the blackness of earthly darkness the firmament of the unseen has blazed with stars of new and significant lustre
the morning star now stands over the tops of the mountains and gales and breezes not of earth show that the gates of day are unclosing
the escape of misse_cassy and emmeline irritated the before surly temper of simon_legree to the last degree and his fury as was to be expected fell upon the defenceless head of tom_loker
when he hurriedly announced the tidings among his hand there was a sudden light in tom_loker eye a sudden upraising of his hand that did not escape him
he thought of forcing him to do it but having had of old experience of his inflexibility when commanded to take part in any deed of inhumanity he would not in his hurry stop to enter into any conflict with him
tom_loker therefore remained behind with a few who had learned of him to pray and offered up prayers for the escape of the fugitives
when simon_legree returned baffled and disappointed all the long working hatred of his soul towards his slave began to gather in a deadly and desperate form
he saw that he did not join the muster of the pursuers had not this man braved him steadily powerfully resistlessly ever since he bought him
was there not a spirit in him which silent as it was burned on him like the fire of perdition
i hate him said simon_legree that night as he sat up in his bed i hate him and isnt he mine
and simon_legree clenched his fist and shook it as if he had something in his hand that he could rend in pieces
but then tom_loker was a faithful valuable servant and although simon_legree hated him the more for that yet the consideration was still somewhat of a restraint to him
the next morning he determined to say nothing as yet to assemble a party from some neighboring plantation with dog and guns to surround the swamp and go about the hunt systematically
if it succeeded well and good if not he would summon tom_loker before him and his teeth clenched and his blood boiled
cant i do what i like with him who to hinder i wonder then he would break the fellow down or there was a dire inward whisper to which his soul assented
in the fury of man mad will he will wittingly and with open eye sell his own soul to the devil to gain his ends and will he be more careful of his neighbor body
well said misse_cassy the next day from the garret as she reconnoitred through the knot hole the hunt going to begin again today
three or four mounted horsemen were curvetting about on the space in front of the house and one or two leashes of strange dog were struggling with the negroes who held them baying and barking at each other
the man are two of them overseers of plantation in the vicinity and others were some of simon_legree associates at the tavern bar of a neighboring city who had come for the interest of the sport
ye say that the interest of the master is a sufficient safeguard for the slave a more hard favored set perhaps could not be imagined
simon_legree was serving brandy profusely round among them as also among the negroes who had been detailed from the various plantation for this service for it was an object to make every service of this kind among the negroes as much of a holiday as possible
misse_cassy placed her ear at the knot hole and as the morning air blew directly towards the house she could overhear a good deal of the conversation
a grave sneer overcast the dark severe gravity of her face as she listened and heard them divide out the ground discuss the rival merits of the dog give orders about firing and the treatment of each in case of capture
we are all sinners but what have we done more than all the rest of the world that we should be treated so
misse_cassy drew back and clasping her hand looked upward and said great almighty god there was a terrible earnestness in her face and voice as she spoke
if it wasnt for you child she said looking at emmeline i go out to them and i thank any one of them that would shoot me down for what use will freedom be to me
can it give me back my child or make me what i used to be emmeline in her child like simplicity was half afraid of the dark moods of misse_cassy
dont said misse_cassy trying to draw it away you ll get me to loving you and i never mean to love anything again
she looked perplexed but made no answer she only took her hand with a gentle caressing movement poor misse_cassy said emmeline dont feel so
if the lord gives us liberty perhaps he ll give you back your daughter at any rate i ll be like a daughter to you
i know i ll never see my poor old mother again i shall love you misse_cassy whether you love me or not
misse_cassy sat down by her put her arm round her neck stroked her soft brown hair and emmeline then wondered at the beauty of her magnificent eye now soft with tear
the gentle child like spirit conquered em said misse_cassy i ve hungered for my child and thirsted for them and my eye fail with longing for them
here here she said striking her breast it all desolate all empty if god would give me back my child then i could pray
you must trust him misse_cassy said emmeline he is our father his wrath is upon us said misse_cassy he has turned away in anger
the hunt was long animated and thorough but unsuccessful and with grave ironic exultation misse_cassy looked down on simon_legree as weary and dispirited he alighted from his horse
no misse_cassy he will be good to us let us hope in him said emmeline i always have had hope
now quimbo said simon_legree as he stretched himself down in the sitting room you jest go and walk that tom_loker up here right away
the old cuss is at the bottom of this yer whole matter and i ll have it out of his old black hide or i ll know the reason why
sambo and quimbo both though hating each other were joined in one mind by a no less cordial hatred of tom_loker
simon_legree had told them at first that he had bought him for a general overseer in his absence and this had begun an ill will on their part which had increased in their debased and servile nature as they saw him becoming obnoxious to their master displeasure
tom_loker heard the message with a forewarning heart for he knew all the plan of the fugitives escape and the place of their present concealment he knew the deadly character of the man he had to deal with and his despotic power
quimbo therefore departed with a will to execute his orders but he felt strong in god to meet death rather than betray the helpless
he sat his basket down by the row and looking up said into thy hand i commend my spirit thou hast redeemed me
oh lord god of truth and then quietly yielded himself to the rough brutal grasp with which quimbo seized him
ay ay said the giant as he dragged him along ye ll cotch it now i ll boun mas s back up high
no sneaking out now tell ye ye ll get it and no mistake see how ye ll look now helpin mas s nigger to run away
see what ye ll get the savage word none of them reached that ear a higher voice there was saying fear not them that kill the body and after that have no more that they can do
nerve and bone of that poor man body vibrated to those word as if touched by the finger of god and he felt the strength of a thousand soul in one
as he passed along the trees and bushes the huts of his servitude the whole scene of his degradation seemed to whirl by him as the landscape by the rushing ear
well tom_loker said simon_legree walking up and seizing him grimly by the collar of his coat and speaking through his teeth in a paroxysm of determined rage do you know i ve made up my mind to kill you
his soul throbbed his home was in sight and the hour of release seemed at hand it very likely mas said tom_loker calmly
i have said simon_legree with a grim terrible calmness done just that thing tom_loker unless you ll tell me what you know about these yer gal
tom_loker stood silent ye hear said simon_legree stamping with a roar like that of an incensed lion speak
i hant got nothing to tell mas said tom_loker with a slow firm deliberate utterance do you dare to tell me ye old black christian ye dont know said simon_legree
tom_loker was silent speak thundered simon_legree striking him furiously do you know anything i know mas but i cant tell anything
simon_legree drew in a long breath and suppressing his rage took tom_loker by the arm and approaching his face almost to his said in a terrible voice hark tom_loker ye think cause i ve let you off before i dont mean what i say but this time i ve made up my mind and counted the cost
i can die you ve always stood it out again me now i ll conquer ye or kill ye one ort other
tom_loker looked up to his master and answered mas if you was sick or in trouble or dying and i could save ye
i give ye my heart blood and if taking every drop of blood in this poor old body would save your precious soul i give em freely as the lord gave his for me
i ll count every drop of blood there is in you and take em one by one till ye give up mas dont bring this great sin on your soul
it will hurt you more thant will me do the worst you can my troubles ll be over soon but if ye dont repent yours wont never end
like a strange snatch of heavenly music heard in the lull of a tempest this burst of feeling made a moment blank pause
simon_legree stood aghast and looked at tom_loker and there was such a silence that the tick of the old clock could be heard measuring with silent touch the last moment of mercy and probation to that hardened heart
it was but a moment there was one hesitating pause one irresolute relenting thrill and the spirit of evil came back with seven fold vehemence and simon_legree foaming with rage smote his victim to the ground
scenes of blood and cruelty are shocking to our ear and heart what man has nerve to do man has not nerve to hear
what brother man and brother christian must suffer cannot be told us even in our secret chamber it so harrows the soul and yet oh my country
but of old there was one whose suffering changed an instrument of torture degradation and shame into a symbol of glory honor and immortal life and where his spirit is neither degrading stripes nor blood nor insults can make the christian last struggle less than glorious
was he alone that long night whose brave loving spirit was bearing up in that old shed against buffeting and brutal stripes
these thing are done under the shadow of thy law jesus_christ thy church sees them almost in silence nay there stood by him one seen by him alone like unto the son of god
the tempter stood by him too blinded by furious despotic will every moment pressing him to shun that agony by the betrayal of the innocent
like his master he knew that if he saved others himself he could not save nor could utmost extremity wring from him word save of prayers and holy trust
but the brave true heart was firm on the eternal rock he most gone mas said sambo touched in spite of himself by the patience of his victim
pay away till he gives up give it to him give it to him shouted simon_legree i ll take every drop of blood he has unless he confesses
tom_loker opened his eye and looked upon his master ye poor miserable critter he said there aint no more ye can do
i forgive ye with all my soul and he fainted entirely away i lieve my soul he done for finally said simon_legree stepping forward to look at him
yes he is well his mouth shut up at last that one comfort yes simon_legree but who shall shut up that voice in thy soul
that soul past repentance past prayer past hope in whom the fire that never shall be quenched is already burning yet tom_loker was not quite gone
his wondrous word and pious prayers had struck upon the heart of the imbruted blacks who had been the instruments of cruelty upon him and the instant simon_legree withdrew they took him down and in their ignorance sought to call him back to life as if that were any favor to him
sartin we been doin a drefful wicked thing said sambo hopes mas ll have to count for it and not we
they washed his wounds they provided a rude bed of some refuse cotton for him to lie down on and one of them stealing up to the house begged a drink of brandy of simon_legree pretending that he was tired and wanted it for himself
he brought it back and poured it down tom_loker throat tom_loker said quimbo we been awful wicked to ye
i forgive ye with all my heart said tom_loker faintly tom_loker do tell us who is lord_jesus anyhow
said sambo lord_jesus that been a standin by you so all this night who is he the word roused the failing fainting spirit
he poured forth a few energetic sentences of that wondrous one his life his death his everlasting presence and power to save
they wept both the two savage man why didnt i never hear this before said sambo but i do believe i cant help it
lord_jesus have mercy on us poor critters said tom_loker i be willing to bar all i have if it ll only bring ye to jesus_christ
two day after a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue of china trees and throwing the reins hastily on the horse neck sprang out and inquired for the owner of the place
o lord give me these two more soul i pray that prayer was answered chapter xli the young master it was george_harris mr_shelby and to show how he came to be there we must go back in our story
the letter of miss_ophelia to mrs mr_shelby had by some unfortunate accident been detained for a month or two at some remote post office before it reached its destination and of course before it was received tom_loker was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the red river
mrs mr_shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern but any immediate action upon it was an impossibility she was then in attendance on the sick bed of her husband who lay delirious in the crisis of a fever
master george_harris mr_shelby who in the interval had changed from a boy to a tall young man was her constant and faithful assistant and her only reliance in superintending his father affairs
miss_ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the lawyer who did business for the st clares and the most that in the emergency could be done was to address a letter of inquiry to him
the sudden death of mr_shelby a few day after brought of course an absorbing pressure of other interests for a season
mr_shelby showed his confidence in his wife ability by appointing her sole executrix upon his estates and thus immediately a large and complicated amount of business was brought upon her hand
mrs mr_shelby with characteristic energy applied herself to the work of straightening the entangled web of affairs and she and george_harris were for some time occupied with collecting and examining accounts selling property and settling debts for mrs mr_shelby was determined that everything should be brought into tangible and recognizable shape let the consequences to her prove what they might
in the mean time they received a letter from the lawyer to whom miss_ophelia had referred them saying that he knew nothing of the matter that the man was sold at a public auction and that beyond receiving the money he knew nothing of the affair
neither george_harris nor mrs mr_shelby could be easy at this result and accordingly some six months after the latter having business for his mother down the river resolved to visit new orleans in person and push his inquiries in hopes of discovering tom_loker whereabouts and restoring him
after some months of unsuccessful search by the merest accident george_harris fell in with a man in new orleans who happened to be possessed of the desired information and with his money in his pocket our hero took steamboat for red river resolving to find out and re purchase his old friend
simon_legree received the stranger with a kind of surly hospitality i understand said the young man that you bought in new orleans a boy named tom_loker
he was soon introduced into the house where he found simon_legree in the sitting room he used to be on my father place and i came to see if i couldnt buy him back
simon_legree brow grew dark and he broke out passionately yes i did buy such a fellow and a l of a bargain i had of it too
the most rebellious saucy impudent dog set up my nigger to run away got off two gal worth eight hundred or a thousand apiece
he owned to that and when i bid him tell me where they was he up and said he knew but he wouldnt tell and stood to it though i gave him the cussedest flogging i ever gave nigger yet
i lieve he trying to die but i dont know as he ll make it out where is he said george_harris impetuously
let me see him the cheeks of the young man were crimson and his eye flashed fire but he prudently said nothing as yet
he in dat ar shed said a little fellow who stood holding george_harris horse simon_legree kicked the boy and swore at him but george_harris without saying another word turned and strode to the spot
tom_loker had been lying two day since the fatal night not suffering for every nerve of suffering was blunted and destroyed
he lay for the most part in a quiet stupor for the law of a powerful and well knit frame would not at once release the imprisoned spirit
by stealth there had been there in the darkness of the night poor desolated creature who stole from their scanty hour rest that they might repay to him some of those ministrations of love in which he had always been so abundant
tear had fallen on that honest insensible face tear of late repentance in the poor ignorant heathen whom his dying love and patience had awakened to repentance and bitter prayers breathed over him to a late found saviour of whom they scarce knew more than the name but whom the yearning ignorant heart of man never implores in vain
misse_cassy who had glided out of her place of concealment and by overhearing learned the sacrifice that had been made for her and emmeline had been there the night before defying the danger of detection and moved by the last few word which the affectionate soul had yet strength to breathe the long winter of despair the ice of year had given way and the dark despairing woman had wept and prayed
truly those poor disciples had little to give only the cup of cold water but it was given with full heart when george_harris entered the shed he felt his head giddy and his heart sick
is it possible is it possible said he kneeling down by him uncle tom_loker my poor poor old friend something in the voice penetrated to the ear of the dying
tear which did honor to his manly heart fell from the young man eye as he bent over his poor friend
he moved his head gently smiled and said lord_jesus can make a dying bed feel soft as down pillows are
o dear uncle tom_loker do wake do speak once more look up here mas george_harris your own little mas george_harris dont you know me
slowly the idea seemed to fill his soul and the vacant eye became fixed and brightened the whole face lighted up the hard hand clasped and tear ran down the cheeks
mas george_harris said tom_loker opening his eye and speaking in a feeble voice mas george_harris he looked bewildered
bless the lord it is it is it all i wanted they havent forgot me it warms my soul it does my heart good
now i shall die content bless the lord on my soul you shant die you mustnt die nor think of it
i ve come to buy you and take you home said george_harris with impetuous vehemence mas george_harris ye re too late
the lord bought me and is going to take me home and i long to go heaven is better than kintuck
dont die it ll kill me it ll break my heart to think what you ve suffered and lying in this old shed here poor poor fellow
dont call me poor fellow said tom_loker solemnly i have been poor fellow but that all past and gone now
i right in the door going into glory mas george_harris heaven has come i ve got the victory the lord_jesus has given it to me
glory be to his name george_harris was awe struck at the force the vehemence the power with which these broken sentences were uttered
he sat gazing in silence tom_loker grasped his hand and continued ye mustnt now tell aunt_chloe poor soul how ye found met would be so drefful to her
only tell her ye found me going into glory and that i couldnt stay for no one and tell her the lord stood by me everywhere and al ays and made everything light and easy
and oh the poor chil en and the baby my old heart been most broke for em time and agin tell em all to follow me follow me
give my love to mas and dear good missis and everybody in the place ye dont know pears like i love em all
at this moment simon_legree sauntered up to the door of the shed looked in with a dogged air of affected carelessness and turned away
i love every creature everywhar it nothing but love mas george_harris what a thingt is to be a christian
the old satan said george_harris in his indignation it a comfort to think the devil will pay him for this some of these day
dont oh ye mustnt said tom_loker grasping his hand he a poor mis able critter it awful to think ont oh if he only could repent the lord would forgive him now but i feared he never will
i hope he wont said george_harris i never want to see him in heaven hush mas george_harris it worries me dont feel so
at this moment the sudden flush of strength which the joy of meeting his young master had infused into the dying man gave way
a sudden sinking fell upon him he closed his eye and that mysterious and sublime change passed over his face that told the approach of other world
he ant done me no real harm only opened the gate of the kingdom for me that all he began to draw his breath with long deep inspirations and his broad chest rose and fell heavily
the expression of his face was that of a conqueror who who who shall separate us from the love of jesus_christ
he said in a voice that contended with mortal weakness and with a smile he fell asleep george_harris sat fixed with solemn awe
it seemed to him that the place was holy and as he closed the lifeless eye and rose up from the dead only one thought possessed him that expressed by his simple old friend what a thing it is to be a christian
he turned simon_legree was standing sullenly behind him something in that dying scene had checked the natural fierceness of youthful passion
the presence of the man was simply loathsome to george_harris and he felt only an impulse to get away from him with as few word as possible
fixing his keen dark eye on simon_legree he simply said pointing to the dead you have got all you ever can of him
what shall i pay you for the body i will take it away and bury it decently i dont sell dead nigger said simon_legree doggedly
boy said george_harris in an authoritative tone to two or three negroes who were looking at the body help me lift him up and carry him to my wagon and get me a spade
you are welcome to bury him where and when you like one of them ran for a spade the other two assisted george_harris to carry the body to the wagon
george_harris neither spoke to nor looked at simon_legree who did not countermand his orders but stood whistling with an air of forced unconcern
george_harris spread his cloak in the wagon and had the body carefully disposed of in it moving the seat so as to give it room
then he turned fixed his eye on simon_legree and said with forced composure i have not as yet said to you what i think of this most atrocious affair this is not the time and place
he sulkily followed them to where the wagon stood at the door but sir this innocent blood shall have justice i will proclaim this murder
i will go to the very first magistrate and expose you do said simon_legree snapping his fingers scornfully i like to see you doing it
where you going to get witnesses how you going to prove it come now george_harris saw at once the force of this defiance
there was not a white person on the place and in all southern courts the testimony of colored blood is nothing
he felt at that moment as if he could have rent the heavens with his heart indignant cry for justice but in vain
after all what a fuss for a dead nigger said simon_legree the word was as a spark to a powder magazine
george_harris turned and with one indignant blow knocked simon_legree flat upon his face and as he stood over him blazing with wrath and defiance he would have formed no bad personification of his great namesake triumphing over the dragon
if a man lays them fairly flat in the dust they seem immediately to conceive a respect for him and simon_legree was one of this sort
as he rose therefore and brushed the dust from his clothes he eyed the slowly retreating wagon with some evident consideration nor did he open his mouth till it was out of sight
beyond the boundaries of the plantation george_harris had noticed a dry sandy knoll shaded by a few trees there they made the grave
prudence was never a cardinal virtue of the kentucky boy some man however are decidedly bettered by being knocked down
shall we take off the cloak mas said the negroes when the grave was ready no no bury it with him
it all i can give you now poor tom_loker and you shall have it they laid him in and the man shovelled away silently
they banked it up and laid green turf over it you may go boy said george_harris slipping a quarter into the hand of each
they lingered about however if young mas would please buy us said one we serve him so faithful said the other
hard time here mas said the first do mas buy us please i cant i cant said george_harris with difficulty motioning them off it impossible
witness eternal god said george_harris kneeling on the grave of his poor friend oh witness that from this hour i will do what one man can to drive out this curse of slavery from my land
the poor fellow looked dejected and walked off in silence there is no monument to mark the last resting place of our friend
his lord knows where he lies and will raise him up immortal to appear with him when he shall appear in his glory
he needs none pity him not such a life and death is not for pity not in the riches of omnipotence is the chief glory of god but in self denying suffering love
and blessed are the man whom he calls to fellowship with him bearing their cross after him with patience of such it is written blessed are they that mourn for they shall be comforted
chapter xlii an authentic ghost story for some remarkable reason ghostly legends were uncommonly rife about this time among the servant on simon_legree place
it was whisperingly asserted that footsteps in the dead of night had been heard descending the garret stairs and patrolling the house
in vain the door of the upper entry had been locked the ghost either carried a duplicate key in its pocket or availed itself of a ghost immemorial privilege of coming through the keyhole and promenaded as before with a freedom that was alarming
authorities were somewhat divided as to the outward form of the spirit owing to a custom quite prevalent among negroes and for aught we know among whites too of invariably shutting the eye and covering up head under blankets petticoats or whatever else might come in use for a shelter on these occasions
of course as everybody knows when the bodily eye are thus out of the lists the spiritual eye are uncommonly vivacious and perspicuous and therefore there were abundance of full length portraits of the ghost abundantly sworn and testified to which as is often the case with portraits agreed with each other in no particular except the common family peculiarity of the ghost tribe the wearing of a white sheet
the poor soul were not versed in ancient history and did not know that shakspeare had authenticated this costume by telling how the sheeted dead did squeak and gibber in the streets of rome
and therefore their all hitting upon this is a striking fact in pneumatology which we recommend to the attention of spiritual media generally
be it as it may we have private reasons for knowing that a tall figure in a white sheet did walk at the most approved ghostly hour around the simon_legree premises pass out the door glide about the house disappear at intervals and reappearing pass up the silent stairway into that fatal garret and that in the morning the entry door were all found shut and locked as firm as ever
simon_legree could not help overhearing this whispering and it was all the more exciting to him from the pains that were taken to conceal it from him
he drank more brandy than usual held up his head briskly and swore louder than ever in the daytime but he had bad dreams and the visions of his head on his bed were anything but agreeable
the night after tom_loker body had been carried away he rode to the next town for a carouse and had a high one
hamlet act i scene lines got home late and tired locked his door took out the key and went to bed
after all let a man take what pains he may to hush it down a human soul is an awful ghostly unquiet possession for a bad man to have
who knows all its awful perhapses those shudderings and tremblings which it can no more live down than it can outlive its own eternity
what a fool is he who locks his door to keep out spirit who has in his own bosom a spirit he dares not meet alone whose voice smothered far down and piled over with mountains of earthliness is yet like the forewarning trumpet of doom
but simon_legree locked his door and set a chair against it he set a night lamp at the head of his bed and put his pistols there
he examined the catches and fastenings of the window and then swore he didnt care for the devil and all his angels and went to sleep
who knows the metes and bounds of it well he slept for he was tired slept soundly but finally there came over his sleep a shadow a horror an apprehension of something dreadful hanging over him
he heard a confused noise of screams and groanings and with it all he knew he was asleep and he struggled to wake himself
it was his mother shroud he thought but misse_cassy had it holding it up and showing it to him he was half awake
he was sure something was coming into his room he knew the door was opening but he could not stir hand or foot
at last he turned with a start the door was open and he saw a hand putting out his light it was a cloudy misty moonlight and there he saw it something white gliding in
it stood still by his bed a cold hand touched his a voice said three time in a low fearful whisper come
he heard the still rustle of its ghostly garments come come and while he lay sweating with terror he knew not when or how the thing was gone
he sprang out of bed and pulled at the door it was shut and locked and the man fell down in a swoon
after this simon_legree became a harder drinker than ever before he no longer drank cautiously prudently but imprudently and recklessly there were reports around the country soon after that he was sick and dying
excess had brought on that frightful disease that seems to throw the lurid shadows of a coming retribution back into the present life
none could bear the horrors of that sick room when he raved and screamed and spoke of sights which almost stopped the blood of those who heard him and at his dying bed stood a stern white inexorable figure saying come
by a singular coincidence on the very night that this vision appeared to simon_legree the house door was found open in the morning and some of the negroes had seen two white figures gliding down the avenue towards the high road
it was near sunrise when misse_cassy and emmeline paused for a moment in a little knot of trees near the town
come come misse_cassy was dressed after the manner of the creole spanish lady wholly in black a small black bonnet on her head covered by a veil thick with embroidery concealed her face
it had been agreed that in their escape she was to personate the character of a creole lady and emmeline that of her servant
brought up from early life in connection with the highest society the language movements and air of misse_cassy were all in agreement with this idea and she had still enough remaining with her of a once splendid wardrobe and sets of jewels to enable her to personate the thing to advantage
she stopped in the outskirts of the town where she had noticed trunks for sale and purchased a handsome one this
and accordingly thus escorted by a boy wheeling her trunk and emmeline behind her carrying her carpet bag and sundry bundles she made her appearance at the small tavern like a lady of consideration
she requested the man to send along with her the first person that struck her after her arrival was george_harris mr_shelby who was staying there awaiting the next boat
misse_cassy had remarked the young man from her loophole in the garret and seen him bear away the body of tom_loker and observed with secret exultation his rencontre with simon_legree
subsequently she had gathered from the conversations she had overheard among the negroes as she glided about in her ghostly disguise after nightfall who he was and in what relation he stood to tom_loker
she therefore felt an immediate accession of confidence when she found that he was like herself awaiting the next boat misse_cassy air and manner address and evident command of money prevented any rising disposition to suspicion in the hotel
people never inquire too closely into those who are fair on the main point of paying well a thing which misse_cassy had foreseen when she provided herself with money
in the edge of the evening a boat was heard coming along and george_harris mr_shelby handed misse_cassy aboard with the politeness which comes naturally to every kentuckian and exerted himself to provide her with a good state room
misse_cassy kept her room and bed on pretext of illness during the whole time they were on red river and was waited on with obsequious devotion by her attendant
when they arrived at the mississippi river george_harris having learned that the course of the strange lady was upward like his own proposed to take a state room for her on the same boat with himself good naturedly compassionating her feeble health and desirous to do what he could to assist her
behold therefore the whole party safely transferred to the good steamer cincinnati and sweeping up the river under a powerful head of steam
she sat upon the guards came to the table and was remarked upon in the boat as a lady that must have been very handsome
from the moment that george_harris got the first glimpse of her face he was troubled with one of those fleeting and indefinite likenesses which almost every body can remember and has been at time perplexed with
at table or sitting at her state room door still she would encounter the young man eye fixed on her and politely withdrawn when she showed by her countenance that she was sensible to the observation
misse_cassy health was much better he could not keep himself from looking at her and watching her perpetually misse_cassy became uneasy
she began to think that he suspected something and finally resolved to throw herself entirely on his generosity and intrusted him with her whole history
george_harris was heartily disposed to sympathize with any one who had escaped from simon_legree plantation a place that he could not remember or speak of with patience and with the courageous disregard of consequences which is characteristic of his age and state he assured her that he would do all in his power to protect and bring them through
the next state room to misse_cassy was occupied by a french lady named madame_de_thoux who was accompanied by a fine little daughter a child of some twelve summers
this lady having gathered from george_harris conversation that he was from kentucky seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance in which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl who was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a fortnight trip on a steamboat
george_harris chair was often placed at her state room door and misse_cassy as she sat upon the guards could hear their conversation
madame_de_thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to kentucky where she said she had resided in a former period of her life
george_harris discovered to his surprise that her former residence must have been in his own vicinity and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and thing in his vicinity that was perfectly surprising to him
do you know said madame_de_thoux to him one day of any man in your neighborhood of the name of george_harris
there is an old fellow of that name life not far from my father place said george_harris we never have had much intercourse with him though
he is a large slave owner i believe said madame_de_thoux with a manner which seemed to betray more interest than she was exactly willing to show
he is said george_harris looking rather surprised at her manner did you ever know of his having perhaps you may have heard of his having a mulatto boy named george_harris
certainly george_harris i know him well he married a servant of my mother but has escaped now to canada he has said madame_de_thoux quickly
thank god george_harris looked a surprised inquiry but said nothing madame_de_thoux leaned her head on her hand and burst into tear
he is my brother she said madame said george_harris with a strong accent of surprise yes said madame_de_thoux lifting her head proudly and wiping her tear mr_shelby george_harris is my brother
i am perfectly astonished said george_harris pushing back his chair a pace or two and looking at madame_de_thoux
i was sold to the south when he was a boy said she i was bought by a good and generous man
it is but lately that he died and i was going up to kentucky to see if i could find and redeem my brother
he took me with him to the west indies set me free and married me i heard him speak of a sister emily that was sold south said george_harris
yes indeed i am the one said madame_de_thoux tell me what sort of a a very fine young man said george_harris notwithstanding the curse of slavery that lay on him
he sustained a first rate character both for intelligence and principle i know you see he said because he married in our family
what sort of a girl said madame_de_thoux eagerly a treasure said george_harris a beautiful intelligent amiable girl
very pious my mother had brought her up and trained her as carefully almost as a daughter she could read and write embroider and sew beautifully and was a beautiful singer
father bought her once in one of his trips to new orleans and brought her up as a present to mother
was she born in your house said madame_de_thoux no she was about eight or nine year old then
father would never tell mother what he gave for her but the other day in looking over his old paper we came across the bill of sale
george_harris sat with his back to misse_cassy and did not see the absorbed expression of her countenance as he was giving these details
at this point in the story she touched his arm and with a face perfectly white with interest said do you know the names of the people he bought her of
he paid an extravagant sum for her to be sure i suppose on account of her extraordinary beauty a man of the name of simmons i think was the principal in the transaction
at least i think that was the name on the bill of sale my god said misse_cassy and fell insensible on the floor of the cabin
though neither of them could conjecture what was the cause of misse_cassy fainting still they made all the tumult which is proper in such case george_harris upsetting a wash pitcher and breaking two tumblers in the warmth of his humanity and various lady in the cabin hearing that somebody had fainted crowded the state room door and kept out all the air they possibly could so that on the whole everything was done that could be expected
when she recovered turned her face to the wall and wept and sobbed like a child perhaps mother you can tell what she was thinking of
she felt as sure in that hour that god had had mercy on her and that she should see her daughter as she did months afterwards when but we anticipate
george_harris was wide awake now and so was madame_de_thoux poor misse_cassy perhaps you cannot but chapter xliii results the rest of our story is soon told
george_harris mr_shelby interested as any other young man might be by the romance of the incident no less than by feeling of humanity was at the pains to send to misse_cassy the bill of sale of eliza_harris whose date and name all corresponded with her own knowledge of fact and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity of her child
madame_de_thoux and she thus drawn together by the singular coincidence of their fortunes proceeded immediately to canada and began a tour of inquiry among the stations where the numerous fugitives from slavery are located
at amherstberg they found the missionary with whom george_harris and eliza_harris had taken shelter on their first arrival in canada and through him were enabled to trace the family to montreal
it remained now only for her to trace out the path of the fugitives george_harris and eliza_harris had now been five year free
george_harris had found constant occupation in the shop of a worthy machinist where he had been earning a competent support for his family which in the mean time had been increased by the addition of another daughter
the worthy pastor of the station in amherstberg where george_harris had first landed was so much interested in the statements of madame_de_thoux and misse_cassy that he yielded to the solicitations of the former to accompany them to montreal in their search she bearing all the expense of the expedition
little harry a fine bright boy had been put to a good school and was making rapid proficiency in knowledge the scene now changes to a small neat tenement in the outskirts of montreal the time evening
in one corner of the room was a table covered with a green cloth where was an open writing desk pens paper and over it a shelf of well selected book
a cheerful fire blazes on the hearth a tea table covered with a snowy cloth stands prepared for the evening meal this was george_harris study
the same zeal for self improvement which led him to steal the much coveted arts of reading and writing amid all the toil and discouragements of his early life still led him to devote all his leisure time to self cultivation
at this present time he is seated at the table making notes from a volume of the family library he has been reading
come george_harris says eliza_harris you ve been gone all day do put down that book and let talk while i getting tea do
and little eliza_harris seconds the effort by toddling up to her father and trying to pull the book out of his hand and install herself on his knee as a substitute
you little witch says george_harris yielding as in such circumstances man always must that right says eliza_harris as she begins to cut a loaf of bread
her form a little fuller her air more matronly than of yore but evidently contented and happy as woman need be
harry my boy how did you come on in that sum today says george_harris as he laid his hand on his son head
harry has lost his long curls but he can never lose those eye and eyelashes and that fine bold brow that flushes with triumph as he answers i did it every bit of it myself father and nobody helped me
a little older she looks that right says his father depend on yourself my son you have a better chance than ever your poor father had
at this moment there is a rap at the door and eliza_harris goes and opens it the delighted why this you calls up her husband and the good pastor of amherstberg is welcomed
now if the truth must be told the honest pastor had arranged a little programme according to which this affair was to develop itself and on the way up all had very cautiously and prudently exhorted each other not to let thing out except according to previous arrangement
what was the good man consternation therefore just as he had motioned to the lady to be seated and was taking out his pocket handkerchief to wipe his mouth so as to proceed to his introductory speech in good order when madame_de_thoux upset the whole plan by throwing her arm around george_harris neck and letting all out at once by saying george_harris
there are two more woman with him and eliza_harris asks them to sit down dont you know me i your sister emily
misse_cassy had seated herself more composedly and would have carried on her part very well had not little eliza_harris suddenly appeared before her in exact shape and form every outline and curl just as her daughter was when she saw her last
the little thing peered up in her face and misse_cassy caught her up in her arm pressed her to her bosom saying what at the moment she really believed darling i your mother
in fact it was a troublesome matter to do up exactly in proper order but the good pastor at last succeeded in getting everybody quiet and delivering the speech with which he had intended to open the exercises and in which at last he succeeded so well that his whole audience were sobbing about him in a manner that ought to satisfy any orator ancient or modern
there are some feeling so agitated and tumultuous that they can find rest only by being poured into the bosom of almighty love and then rising up the new found family embraced each other with a holy trust in him who from such peril and dangers and by such unknown way had brought them together
they knelt together and the good man prayed for the note book of a missionary among the canadian fugitives contains truth stranger than fiction
how can it be otherwise when a system prevails which whirls family and scatters their members as the wind whirls and scatters the leaves of autumn
these shores of refuge like the eternal shore often unite again in glad communion heart that for long year have mourned each other as lost
and affecting beyond expression is the earnestness with which every new arrival among them is met if perchance it may bring tidings of mother sister child or wife still lost to view in the shadows of slavery
deeds of heroism are wrought here more than those of romance when defying torture and braving death itself the fugitive voluntarily threads his way back to the terrors and perils of that dark land that he may bring out his sister or mother or wife
one young man of whom a missionary has told us twice re captured and suffering shameful stripes for his heroism had escaped again and in a letter which we heard read tells his friend that he is going back a third time that he may at last bring away his sister
my good sir is this man a hero or a criminal would not you do as much for your sister and can you blame him
but to return to our friend whom we left wiping their eye and recovering themselves from too great and sudden a joy
they are now seated around the social board and are getting decidedly companionable only that misse_cassy who keeps little eliza_harris on her lap occasionally squeezes the little thing in a manner that rather astonishes her and obstinately refuses to have her mouth stuffed with cake to the extent the little one desires alleging what the child rather wonders at that she has got something better than cake and doesnt want it
and indeed in two or three day such a change has passed over misse_cassy that our readers would scarcely know her
she seemed to sink at once into the bosom of the family and take the little one into her heart as something for which it long had waited
indeed her love seemed to flow more naturally to the little eliza_harris than to her own daughter for she was the exact image and body of the child whom she had lost
the despairing haggard expression of her face had given way to one of gentle trust the little one was a flowery bond between mother and daughter through whom grew up acquaintanceship and affection
eliza_harris steady consistent piety regulated by the constant reading of the sacred word made her a proper guide for the shattered and wearied mind of her mother
misse_cassy yielded at once and with her whole soul to every good influence and became a devout and tender christian after a day or two madame_de_thoux told her brother more particularly of her affairs
when she asked george_harris what way she could best apply it for him he answered give me an education emily that has always been my heart desire
the death of her husband had left her an ample fortune which she generously offered to share with the family then i can do all the rest
on mature deliberation it was decided that the whole family should go for some year to france whither they sailed carrying emmeline with them
the good looks of the latter won the affection of the first mate of the vessel and shortly after entering the port she became his wife
george_harris remained four year at a french university and applying himself with an unintermitted zeal obtained a very thorough education
political troubles in france at last led the family again to seek an asylum in this country george_harris feeling and views as an educated man may be best expressed in a letter to one of his friend
true as you have said to me i might mingle in the circles of the whites in this country my shade of color is so slight and that of my wife and family scarce perceptible
i feel somewhat at a loss as to my future course well perhaps on sufferance i might but to tell you the truth i have no wish to
my sympathies are not for my father race but for my mother to him i was no more than a fine dog or horse to my poor heart broken mother
i was a child and though i never saw her after the cruel sale that separated us till she died yet
when i think of all she suffered of my own early sufferings of the distresses and struggles of my heroic wife of my sister sold in the new orleans slave market though
i hope to have no unchristian sentiments yet i may be excused for saying i have no wish to pass for an american or to identify myself with them
it is with the oppressed enslaved african race that i cast in my lot and if i wished anything i would wish myself two shades darker rather than one lighter
i know she always loved me dearly i know it by my own heart the desire and yearning of my soul is for an african nationality
i want a people that shall have a tangible separate existence of its own and where am i to look for it
the race that formed the character of the haytiens was a worn out effeminate one and of course the subject race will be centuries in rising to anything
not in hayti for in hayti they had nothing to start with a stream cannot rise above its fountain where then shall i look
on the shores of africa i see a republic a republic formed of picked man who by energy and self educating force have in many case individually raised themselves above a condition of slavery
having gone through a preparatory stage of feebleness this republic has at last become an acknowledged nation on the face of the earth acknowledged by both france and england
there it is my wish to go and find myself a people i am aware now that i shall have you all against me but before you strike hear me
i have noted the struggle between abolitionist and colonizationist and have received some impressions as a distant spectator which could never have occurred to me as a participator
i grant that this liberia may have subserved all sort of purposes by being played off in the hand of our oppressors against us
during my stay in france i have followed up with intense interest the history of my people in america doubtless the scheme may have been used in unjustifiable way as a means of retarding our emancipation
but the question to me is is there not a god above all man schemes may he not have over ruled their designs and founded for us a nation by them
a nation starts now with all the great problems of republican life and civilization wrought out to its hand it has not to discover but only to apply
let us then all take hold together with all our might and see what we can do with this new enterprise and the whole splendid continent of africa opens before us and our child
our nation shall roll the tide of civilization and christianity along its shores and plant there mighty republics that growing with the rapidity of tropical vegetation shall be for all coming ages
in these day a nation is born in a day do you say that i am deserting my enslaved brethren
i think not if i forget them one hour one moment of my life so may god forget me but what can i do for them here
no not as an individual but let me go and form part of a nation which shall have a voice in the councils of nations and then we can speak
can i break their chains a nation has a right to argue remonstrate implore and present the cause of its race which
an individual has not if europe ever becomes a grand council of free nations as i trust in god it will if
there serfdom and all unjust and oppressive social inequalities are done away and if they as france and england have done acknowledge our position then in the great congress of nations we will make our appeal and present the cause of our enslaved and suffering race and it cannot be that free enlightened america will not then desire to wipe from her escutcheon that bar sinister which disgraces her among nations and is as truly a curse to her as to the enslaved
but you will tell me our race have equal rights to mingle in the american republic as the irishman the german the swede
we ought to be free to meet and mingle to rise by our individual worth without any consideration of caste or color and they who deny us this right are false to their own professed principles of human equality
granted they have we ought in particular to be allowed here we have more than the rights of common man we have the claim of an injured race for reparation
i think that the african race has peculiarities yet to be unfolded in the light of civilization and christianity which if not the same with those of the anglo saxon may prove to be morally of even a higher type
but then i do not want it i want a country a nation of my own to the anglo saxon race has been intrusted the destinies of the world during its pioneer period of struggle and conflict
to that mission its stern inflexible energetic elements were well adapted but as a christian i look for another era to arise
on its borders i trust we stand and the throes that now convulse the nations are to my hope but the birth pangs of an hour of universal peace and brotherhood
i trust that the development of africa is to be essentially a christian one if not a dominant and commanding race they are at least an affectionate magnanimous and forgiving one
having been called in the furnace of injustice and oppression they have need to bind closer to their heart that sublime doctrine of love and forgiveness through which alone they are to conquer which it is to be their mission to spread over the continent of africa
in myself i confess i am feeble for this full half the blood in my veins is the hot and hasty saxon but i have an eloquent preacher of the gospel ever by my side in the person of my beautiful wife
when i wander her gentler spirit ever restores me and keeps before my eye the christian calling and mission of our race
as a christian patriot as a teacher of christianity i go to my country my chosen my glorious africa and to her in my heart i sometimes apply those splendid word of prophecy whereas thou hast been forsaken and hated so that no man went through thee i will make thee an eternal excellence a joy of many generations
you will call me an enthusiast you will tell me that i have not well considered what i am undertaking
but i have considered and counted the cost i go to liberia not as an elysium of romance but as to a field of work
i expect to work with both hand to work hard to work against all sort of difficulties and discouragements and to work till i die
whatever you may think of my determination do not divorce me from your confidence and think that in whatever i do i act with a heart wholly given to my people
this is what i go for and in this i am quite sure i shall not be disappointed george_harris
george_harris with his wife child sister and mother embarked for africa some few weeks after if we are not mistaken the world will yet hear from him there
of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write except a word relating to miss_ophelia and topsy and a farewell chapter which we shall dedicate to george_harris mr_shelby
miss_ophelia took topsy home to vermont with her much to the surprise of the grave deliberative body whom a new englander recognizes under the term our folks
our folks at first thought it an odd and unnecessary addition to their well trained domestic establishment but so thoroughly efficient was miss_ophelia in her conscientious endeavor to do her duty by her élève that the child rapidly grew in grace and in favor with the family and neighborhood
at the age of womanhood she was by her own request baptized and became a member of the christian church in the place and showed so much intelligence activity and zeal and desire to do good in the world that she was at last recommended and approved as a missionary to one of the stations in africa and we have heard that the same activity and ingenuity which when a child made her so multiform and restless in her developments is now employed in a safer and wholesomer manner in teaching the child of her own country
p it will be a satisfaction to some mother also to state that some inquiries which were set on foot by madame_de_thoux have resulted recently in the discovery of misse_cassy son
being a young man of energy he had escaped some year before his mother and been received and educated by friend of the oppressed in the north
the liberator george_harris mr_shelby had written to his mother merely a line stating the day that she might expect him home
he will soon follow his family to africa chapter xliv of the death scene of his old friend he had not the heart to write
he had tried several time and only succeeded in half choking himself and invariably finished by tearing up the paper wiping his eye and rushing somewhere to get quiet
there was a pleased bustle all though the mr_shelby mansion that day in expectation of the arrival of young mas george_harris
mrs mr_shelby was seated in her comfortable parlor where a cheerful hickory fire was dispelling the chill of the late autumn evening
a supper table glittering with plate and cut glass was set out on whose arrangements our former friend old aunt_chloe was presiding
arrayed in a new calico dress with clean white apron and high well starched turban her black polished face glowing with satisfaction she lingered with needless punctiliousness around the arrangements of the table merely as an excuse for talking a little to her mistress
law now wont it look natural to him she said thar i set his plate just whar he likes it round by the fire
mas george_harris allers wants de warm seat go way why didnt sally get out de best tea pot de little new one mas r
george_harris got for missis christmas i ll have it out and missis has heard from mas george_harris she said inquiringly
yes aunt_chloe but only a line just to say he would be home tonight if he could that all didnt say nothing bout my old man pose
said aunt_chloe still fidgeting with the tea cups no he didnt he did not speak of anything aunt_chloe he said he would tell all when he got home
dont see for my part how white people gen lly can bar to hev to write thing much as they do writin such slow oneasy kind work
jes like mas george_harris he allers so ferce for tellin everything hisself i allers minded dat ar in mas george_harris
mrs mr_shelby smiled i a thinkin my old man wont know de boy and de baby lor she de biggest gal now good
she is too and peart polly is she out to the house now watchin de hoe cake i got jist de very pattern my old man liked so much a bakin
jist sich as i gin him the mornin he was took off lord bless us how i felt dat ar morning
she had felt uneasy ever since she received her son letter lest something should prove to be hidden behind the veil of silence which he had drawn
mrs mr_shelby sighed and felt a heavy weight on her heart at this allusion missis has got dem bills said aunt_chloe anxiously
yes aunt_chloe cause i wants to show my old man dem very bills de perfectioner gave me
thank you mas says i i would only my old man coming home and missis she cant do without me no longer
and say he aunt_chloe i wish you stay longer there jist what i telled him berry nice man dat mas jones was
aunt_chloe had pertinaciously insisted that the very bills in which her wages had been paid should be preserved to show her husband in memorial of her capability
and mrs mr_shelby had readily consented to humor her in the request he wont know polly my old man wont
law it five year since they tuck him she was a baby den couldnt but jist stand remember how tickled he used to be cause she would keep a fallin over when she sot out to walk
law a me the rattling of wheels now was heard mas george_harris said aunt_chloe starting to the window
mrs mr_shelby ran to the entry door and was folded in the arm of her son aunt_chloe stood anxiously straining her eye out into the darkness
said george_harris stopping compassionately and taking her hard black hand between both his i have given all my fortune to have brought him with me but he gone to a better country
poor aunt_chloe there was a passionate exclamation from mrs mr_shelby but aunt_chloe said nothing the party entered the supper room
thar said she gathering it up and holding it with a trembling hand to her mistress dont never want to see nor hear ont again
the money of which aunt_chloe was so proud was still lying on the table jist as i knewt would be sold and murdered on dem ar old plantation
mrs mr_shelby followed her softly and took one of her hand drew her down into a chair and sat down by her
aunt_chloe turned and was walking proudly out of the room my poor good aunt_chloe said she aunt_chloe leaned her head on her mistress shoulder and sobbed out missis
scuse me my heart broke dat all i know it is said mrs mr_shelby as her tear fell fast and i cannot heal it but lord_jesus can
he healeth the broken hearted and bindeth up their wounds there was a silence for some time and all wept together
at last george_harris sitting down beside the mourner took her hand and with simple pathos repeated the triumphant scene of her husband death and his last messages of love
about a month after this one morning all the servant of the mr_shelby estate were convened together in the great hall that ran through the house to hear a few word from their young master
to the surprise of all he appeared among them with a bundle of paper in his hand containing a certificate of freedom to every one on the place which he read successively and presented amid the sobs and tear and shouts of all present
many however pressed around him earnestly begging him not to send them away and with anxious face tendering back their free paper
we dont want to be no freer than we are we allers had all we wanted we dont want to leave de ole place and mas and missis and de rest
my good friend said george_harris as soon as he could get a silence there ll be no need for you to leave me
the place wants as many hand to work it as it did before we need the same about the house that we did before
but you are now free man and free woman i shall pay you wages for your work such as we shall agree on
the advantage is that in case of my getting in debt or dying thing that might happen you cannot now be taken up and sold
i expect to carry on the estate and to teach you what perhaps it will take you some time to learn how to use the rights i give you as free man and woman
i expect you to be good and willing to learn and i trust in god that i shall be faithful and willing to teach
an aged partriarchal negro who had grown gray and blind on the estate now rose and lifting his trembling hand said let us give thanks unto the lord
as all kneeled by one consent a more touching and hearty te deum never ascended to heaven though borne on the peal of organ bell and cannon than came from that honest old heart
on rising another struck up a methodist hymn of which the burden was the year of jubilee is come return ye ransomed sinners home
one thing more said george_harris as he stopped the congratulations of the throng you all remember our good old uncle tom_loker
george_harris here gave a short narration of the scene of his death and of his loving farewell to all on the place and added it was on his grave my friend that i resolved before god that i would never own another slave while it was possible to free him that nobody through me should ever run the risk of being parted from home and friend and dying on a lonely plantation as he died
so when you rejoice in your freedom think that you owe it to that good old soul and pay it back in kindness to his wife and child
think of your freedom every time you see uncle tom_loker cabin and let it be a memorial to put you all in mind to follow in his steps and be honest and faithful and christian as he was
and now my friend look up and thank god for the blessing of freedom chapter xlv concluding remarks
the writer has often been inquired of by correspondents from different part of the country whether this narrative is a true one and to these inquiries she will give one general answer
the separate incidents that compose the narrative are to a very great extent authentic occurring many of them either under her own observation or that of her personal friend
she or her friend have observed characters the counterpart of almost all that are here introduced and many of the sayings are word for word as heard herself or reported to her
the personal appearance of eliza_harris the character ascribed to her are sketches drawn from life the incorruptible fidelity piety and honesty of uncle tom_loker had more than one development to her personal knowledge
some of the most deeply tragic and romantic some of the most terrible incidents have also their parallels in reality the incident of the mother crossing the ohio river on the ice is a well known fact
the story of old prue in the second volume was an incident that fell under the personal observation of a brother of the writer then collecting clerk to a large mercantile house in new orleans
of him her brother thus wrote speaking of visiting his plantation on a collecting tour he actually made me feel of his fist which was like a blacksmith hammer or a nodule of iron telling me that it was calloused with knocking down nigger
when i left the plantation i drew a long breath and felt as if i had escaped from an ogre den
that the tragical fate of tom_loker also has too many time had its parallel there are living witnesses all over our land to testify
let it be remembered that in all southern state it is a principle of jurisprudence that no person of colored lineage can testify in a suit against a white and it will be easy to see that such a case may occur wherever there is a man whose passions outweigh his interests and a slave who has manhood or principle enough to resist his will
from the same source was derived the character of the planter simon_legree there is actually nothing to protect the slave life but the character of the master
fact too shocking to be contemplated occasionally force their way to the public ear and the comment that one often hears made on them is more shocking than the thing itself
it is said very likely such case may now and then occur but they are no sample of general practice
if the law of new england were so arranged that a master could now and then torture an apprentice to death would it be received with equal composure
would it be said these case are rare and no samples of general practice this injustice is an inherent one in the slave system it cannot exist without it
the public and shameless sale of beautiful mulatto and quadroon girl has acquired a notoriety from the incidents following the capture of the pearl
we extract the following from the speech of hon horace mann one of the legal counsel for the defendants in that case
he says in that company of seventy six persons who attempted in to escape from the district of columbia in the schooner pearl and whose officers i assisted in defending there were several young and healthy girl who had those peculiar attractions of form and feature which connoisseurs prize so highly
elizabeth russel was one of them she immediately fell into the slave trader fangs and was doomed for the new orleans market
they offered eighteen hundred dollar to redeem her and some there were who offered to give that would not have much left after the gift but the fiend of a slave trader was inexorable
she was despatched to new orleans but when about half way there god had mercy on her and smote her with death
the heart of those that saw her were touched with pity for her fate there were two girl named edmundson in the same company
when about to be sent to the same market an older sister went to the shambles to plead with the wretch who owned them for the love of god to spare his victims
he bantered her telling what fine dresses and fine furniture they would have yes she said that may do very well in this life but what will become of them in the next
they too were sent to new orleans but were afterwards redeemed at an enormous ransom and brought back is it not plain from this that the histories of emmeline and misse_cassy may have many counterparts
justice too obliges the author to state that the fairness of mind and generosity attributed to augustine_st_clare are not without a parallel as the following anecdote will show
a few year since a young southern gentleman was in cincinnati with a favorite servant who had been his personal attendant from a boy
the young man took advantage of this opportunity to secure his own freedom and fled to the protection of a quaker who was quite noted in affairs of this kind
he had always treated the slave with such indulgence and his confidence in his affection was such that he believed he must have been practised upon to induce him to revolt from him
he visited the quaker in high anger but being possessed of uncommon candor and fairness was soon quieted by his arguments and representations
it was a side of the subject which he never had heard never had thought on and he immediately told the quaker that if his slave would to his own face say that it was his desire to be free he would liberate him
an interview was forthwith procured and nathan was asked by his young master whether he had ever had any reason to complain of his treatment in any respect
the owner was exceedingly indignant no mas said nathan you ve always been good to me well then why do you want to leave me
mas may die and then who get me i rather be a free man after some deliberation the young master replied nathan in your place i think i should feel very much so myself
he immediately made him out free paper deposited a sum of money in the hand of the quaker to be judiciously used in assisting him to start in life and left a very sensible and kind letter of advice to the young man
the author hopes she has done justice to that nobility generosity and humanity which in many case characterize individuals at the south
you are free that letter was for some time in the writer hand such instances save us from utter despair of our kind
for many year of her life the author avoided all reading upon or allusion to the subject of slavery considering it as too painful to be inquired into and one which advancing light and civilization would certainly live down
but since the legislative act of when she heard with perfect surprise and consternation christian and humane people actually recommending the remanding escaped fugitives into slavery as a duty binding on good
she heard on all hand from kind compassionate and estimable people in the free state of the north deliberations and discussions as to what christian duty could be on this
head she could only think these man and christians cannot know what slavery is if they did such a question could never be open for discussion
but she asks any person who knows the world are such characters common anywhere citizens when and from this arose a desire to exhibit it in a living dramatic reality
she has endeavored to show it fairly in its best and its worst phases in its best aspect she has perhaps been successful but
oh who shall say what yet remains untold in that valley and shadow of death that lies the other side
to you generous noble minded man and woman of the south you whose virtue and magnanimity and purity of character are the greater for the severer trial it has
have you not in your own secret soul in your own private conversings felt that there are woes and evils in this accursed system far beyond what are here shadowed or can be shadowed
encountered to you is her appeal can it be otherwise is man ever a creature to be trusted with wholly irresponsible power
and does not the slave system by denying the slave all legal right of testimony make every individual owner an irresponsible despot
if there is as we admit a public sentiment among you man of honor justice and humanity is there not also another kind of public sentiment among the ruffian the brutal and debased
and cannot the ruffian the brutal the debased by slave law own just as many slave as the best and purest
can anybody fail to make the inference what the practical result will be are the honorable the just the high minded and compassionate the majority anywhere in this world
but a slave trade as systematic as ever was carried on on the coast of africa is an inevitable attendant and result of american slavery
the writer has given only a faint shadow a dim picture of the anguish and despair that are at this very moment riving thousands of heart shattering thousands of family and driving a helpless and sensitive race to frenzy and despair
there are those living who know the mother whom this accursed traffic has driven to the murder of their child and themselves seeking in death a shelter from woes more dreaded than death
nothing of tragedy can be written can be spoken can be conceived that equals the frightful reality of scenes daily and hourly acting on our shores beneath the shadow of american law and the shadow of the cross of jesus_christ
and now man and woman of america is this a thing to be trifled with apologized for and passed over in silence
farmers of massachusetts of new hampshire of vermont of connecticut who read this book by the blaze of your winter evening fire strong hearted generous sailors and ship owners of maine is this a thing for you to countenance and encourage
brave and generous man of new york farmers of rich and joyous ohio and ye of the wide prairie state answer is this a thing for you to protect and countenance
and you mother of america you who have learned by the cradles of your own child to love and feel for all mankind by the sacred love you bear your child by your joy in his beautiful spotless infancy by the motherly pity and tenderness with which you guide his growing year by the anxieties of his education by the prayers you breathe for his soul eternal good i beseech you pity the mother who has all your affections and not one legal right to protect guide or educate the child of her bosom
by the sick hour of your child by those dying eye which you can never forget by those last cries that wrung your heart when you could neither help nor save by the desolation of that empty cradle that silent nursery i beseech you pity those mother that are constantly made childless by the american slave trade
the slave trade is now by american law considered as piracy and its heart break and its horrors can they be told and say mother of america is this a thing to be defended sympathized with passed over in silence
do you say that the people of the free state have nothing to do with it and can do nothing would to god this were true
the people of the free state have defended encouraged and participated and are more guilty for it before god than the south in that they have not the apology of education or custom
if the mother of the free state had all felt as they should in time past the sons of the free state would not have been the holders and proverbially the hardest master of slave the sons of the free state would not have connived at the extension of slavery in our national body the sons of the free state would not as they do trade the soul and body of man as an equivalent to money in their mercantile dealings
there are multitudes of slave temporarily owned and sold again by merchants in northern cities and shall the whole guilt or obloquy of slavery fall only on the south
northern man northern mother northern christians have something more to do than denounce their brethren at the south they have to look to the evil among themselves
but it is not true but what can any individual do of that every individual can judge there is one thing that every individual can do they can see to it that they feel right
an atmosphere of sympathetic influence encircles every human being and the man or woman who feels strongly healthily and justly on the great interests of humanity is a constant benefactor to the human race
see then to your sympathies in this matter are they in harmony with the sympathies of jesus_christ or are they swayed and perverted by the sophistries of worldly policy
christian man and woman of the north still further you have another power you can pray do you believe in prayer or has it become an indistinct apostolic tradition
and pray for those distressed christians whose whole chance of religious improvement is an accident of trade and sale from whom any adherence to the morals of christianity is in many case an impossibility unless they have given them from above the courage and grace of martyrdom
on the shores of our free state are emerging the poor shattered broken remnants of family man and woman escaped by miraculous providences from the surges of slavery feeble in knowledge and in many case infirm in moral constitution from a system which confounds and confuses every principle of christianity and morality
you pray for the heathen abroad pray also for the heathen at home but still more they come to seek a refuge among you they come to seek education knowledge christianity
does not every american christian owe to the african race some effort at reparation for the wrongs that the american nation has brought upon them
what do you owe to these poor unfortunates oh christians shall the door of churches and school house be shut upon them
shall the church of jesus_christ hear in silence the taunt that is thrown at them and shrink away from the helpless hand that they stretch out and by her silence encourage the cruelty that would chase them from our borders
if it must be so the country will have reason to tremble when it remembers that the fate of nations is in the hand of one who is very pitiful and of tender compassion
shall state arise and shake them out if it must be so it will be a mournful spectacle do you say we dont want them here let them go to africa
that the providence of god has provided a refuge in africa is indeed a great and noticeable fact but that is no reason why the church of jesus_christ should throw off that responsibility to this outcast race which her profession demands of her
to fill up liberia with an ignorant inexperienced half barbarized race just escaped from the chains of slavery would be only to prolong for ages the period of struggle and conflict which attends the inception of new enterprises
let the church of the north receive these poor sufferers in the spirit of jesus_christ receive them to the educating advantages of christian republican society and schools until they have attained to somewhat of a moral and intellectual maturity and then assist them in their passage to those shores where they may put in practice the lessons they have learned in america
there is a body of man at the north comparatively small who have been doing this and as the result this country has already seen examples of man formerly slave who have rapidly acquired property reputation and education
talent has been developed which considering the circumstances is certainly remarkable and for moral traits of honesty kindness tenderness of feeling for heroic efforts and self denials endured for the ransom of brethren and friend yet in slavery they have been remarkable to a degree that considering the influence under which they were born is surprising
the writer has lived for many year on the frontier line of slave state and has had great opportunities of observation among those who formerly were slave
they have been in her family as servant and in default of any other school to receive them she has in many case had them instructed in a family school with her own child
she has also the testimony of missionaries among the fugitives in canada in coincidence with her own experience and her deductions with regard to the capabilities of the race are encouraging in the highest degree
there is nothing that they are not willing to give or do to have their child instructed and so far as the writer has observed herself or taken the testimony of teachers among them they are remarkably intelligent and quick to learn
the first desire of the emancipated slave generally is for education the results of schools founded for them by benevolent individuals in cincinnati fully establish this
the author gives the following statement of fact on the authority of professor e stowe then of lane seminary ohio with regard to emancipated slave now resident in cincinnati given to show the capability of the race even without any very particular assistance or encouragement
the initial letter alone are given they are all residents of cincinnati furniture maker twenty year in the city worth ten thousand dollar all his own earnings a baptist
full black stolen from africa sold in new orleans been free fifteen year paid for himself six hundred dollar a farmer owns several farms in indiana presbyterian probably worth fifteen or twenty thousand dollar all earned by himself
full black dealer in real estate worth thirty thousand dollar about forty year old free six year paid eighteen hundred dollar for his family member of the baptist church received a legacy from his master which he has taken good care of and increased
full black coal dealer about thirty year old worth eighteen thousand dollar paid for himself twice being once defrauded to the amount of sixteen hundred dollar made all his money by his own efforts much of it while a slave hiring his time of his master and doing business for himself a fine gentlemanly fellow
three fourths black barber and waiter from kentucky nineteen year free paid for self and family over three thousand dollar deacon in the baptist church
three fourths black white washer from kentucky nine year free paid fifteen hundred dollar for self and family recently died aged sixty worth six thousand dollar
professor stowe says with all these except i have been for some year personally acquainted and make my statements from my own knowledge
g g the writer well remembers an aged colored woman who was employed as a washerwoman in her father family
she was a remarkably active and capable young woman and by her industry and thrift and the most persevering self denial raised nine hundred dollar for her husband freedom which she paid as she raised it into the hand of his master
the daughter of this woman married a slave she yet wanted a hundred dollar of the price when he died she never recovered any of the money
these are but few fact among multitudes which might be adduced to show the self denial energy patience and honesty which the slave has exhibited in a state of freedom
and let it be remembered that these individuals have thus bravely succeeded in conquering for themselves comparative wealth and social position in the face of every disadvantage and discouragement
the colored man by the law of ohio cannot be a voter and till within a few year was even denied the right of testimony in legal suits with the white
in all state of the union we see man but yesterday burst from the shackles of slavery who by a self educating force which cannot be too much admired have risen to highly respectable stations in society
nor are these instances confined to the state of ohio pennington among clergymen douglas and ward among editors are well known instances
if this persecuted race with every discouragement and disadvantage have done thus much how much more they might do if the christian church would act towards them in the spirit of her lord
this is an age of the world when nations are trembling and convulsed a mighty influence is abroad surging and heaving the world as with an earthquake
and is america safe every nation that carries in its bosom great and unredressed injustice has in it the elements of this last convulsion
for what is this mighty influence thus rousing in all nations and languages those groanings that cannot be uttered for man freedom and equality
is not this power the spirit of him whose kingdom is yet to come and whose will to be done on earth as it is in heaven
for that day shall burn as an oven and he shall appear as a swift witness against those that oppress the hireling in his wages the widow and the fatherless and that turn aside the stranger in his right and he shall break in pieces the oppressor
o church of jesus_christ read the signs of the time but who may abide the day of his appearing are not these dread word for a nation bearing in her bosom so mighty an injustice
every time that you pray that the kingdom of jesus_christ may come can you forget that prophecy associates in dread fellowship the day of vengeance with the year of his redeemed
christians a day of grace is yet held out to us both north and south have been guilty before god and the christian church has a heavy account to answer
not by combining together to protect injustice and cruelty and making a common capital of sin is this union to be saved but by repentance justice and mercy for not surer is the eternal law by which the millstone sinks in the ocean than that stronger law by which injustice and cruelty shall bring on nations the wrath of almighty god
