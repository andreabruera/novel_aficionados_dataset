the impending crisis of the south uncle $tom_loker$ cabin or life among the lowly is an anti slavery novel by american author harriet beecher stowe
published in the novel had profound effect on attitudes toward african americans and slavery in the s and is said to have helped lay the groundwork for the civil war
stowe connecticut born teacher at the hartford female seminary and an active abolitionist featured the character of uncle $tom_loker$ long suffering black slave around whom the stories of other characters revolve
the sentimental novel depicts the reality of slavery while also asserting that christian love can overcome something as destructive as enslavement of #fellow# human beings
uncle $tom_loker$ cabin was the best selling novel of the century and the second best selling book of that century following the bible
in the first year after it was published copies of the book were sold in the united states one million copies in great britain
lc classps ufollowed bya key to uncle it is credited with helping fuel the abolitionist cause in the in three years after it was published it was called the most popular novel of our day
the impact attributed to the book is great reinforced by story that when abraham lincoln met stowe at the start of the civil war lincoln declared so this is the little lady who started this great war
apocryphal it did not appear in print until and it has been argued that the long term durability of lincoln greeting as an anecdote in literary studies and stowe scholarship can perhaps be explained in part by the #desire# among many contemporary intellectuals to affirm the role of literature as an agent of social change
these include the affectionate dark skinned mammy the pickaninny stereotype of black children and the uncle $tom_loker$ or dutiful long suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress
in recent years the negative associations with uncle $tom_loker$ cabin have to an extent overshadowed the historical impact of the book as vital antislavery tool

much of the book was composed in brunswick maine where her husband calvin ellis stowe taught at his alma mater bowdoin college
an engraving of harriet beecher stowe from based on an oil painting by alonzo chappel stowe was partly inspired to create uncle $tom_loker$ cabin by the slave narrative the life of josiah henson formerly slave now an inhabitant of canada as narrated by himself
henson formerly enslaved black #man# had lived and worked on acre km tobacco plantation in north bethesda maryland owned by isaac riley
henson escaped slavery in by fleeing to the province of upper canada now ontario where he helped other fugitive slaves settle and become self sufficient and where he wrote his memoirs
the book and the plays it inspired helped popularize number of stereotypes about black people stowe acknowledged in that henson writings inspired uncle $tom_loker$ cabin
when stowe #work# became best seller henson republished his memoirs as the memoirs of uncle $tom_loker$ and traveled on lecture tours extensively in the united states and europe
stowe novel lent its name to henson home uncle $tom_loker$ cabin historic site near dresden ontario canada which since the has been museum
the cabin where henson lived while he was enslaved no longer exists but cabin on the riley farm erroneously thought to be the henson cabin was purchased by the montgomery county maryland government in
as it is testimony of thousand witnesses volume co authored by theodore dwight weld and the grimké sisters is also source of some of the novel content
stowe said she based the novel on number of interviews with people who escaped slavery during the time when she was living in cincinnati ohio across the ohio river from kentucky slave state
in cincinnati the underground railroad had local abolitionist sympathizers and was active in efforts to help runaway slaves on their escape route from the south
and plans are underway to build museum and interpretive center on the site american slavery stowe mentioned number of the inspirations and sources for her novel in key to uncle $tom_loker$ cabin
however later research indicated that stowe did not read many of the book cited #work# until after she had published her novel
first #appearance# of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin as serialized in the national era june uncle $tom_loker$ cabin first appeared as week serial in the national era an abolitionist periodical starting with the june issue
this non fiction book was intended to verify stowe claims about slavery it was originally intended as shorter narrative that would run for only few weeks
stowe expanded the story significantly however and it was instantly popular such that several protests were sent to the era office when she missed an issue
because of the story popularity the publisher $john_bunyan$ jewett contacted stowe about turning the serial into book while stowe questioned if anyone would read uncle $tom_loker$ cabin in book form she eventually consented to the request
convinced the book would be popular jewett made the unusual decision for the time to have six full page illustrations by hammatt billings engraved for the first printing and soon sold out its complete print run
a number of other editions were soon printed including deluxe edition in featuring illustrations by billings in the first year of publication copies of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin were sold
no more copies were produced for many years and if as is claimed abraham lincoln greeted stowe in as the little #woman# who wrote the book that made this great war the #work# had effectively been out of print for many years
jewett went out of business and it was not until ticknor and fields put the #work# back in print in november that demand began again to increase
the book was translated into all major languages and in the united states it became the second best selling book after the bible
number of the early editions carried an introduction by rev james sherman congregational minister in london noted for his abolitionist views
at that point however demand came to an unexpected halt uncle $tom_loker$ cabin sold equally well in britain with the first london edition appearing in may and selling copies
in few years over million copies of the book were in circulation in britain although most of these were infringing copies a similar situation occurred in the united states

when $eliza_harris$ overhears mr and mrs $mr_shelby$ discussing plans to sell $tom_loker$ and $harry$ $eliza_harris$ determines to run away with her son

despite $simon_legree$ cruelty however $tom_loker$ refuses to stop reading his bible and comforting the other slaves as best he can while at the plantation $tom_loker$ meets $misse_cassy$ another of $simon_legree$ slaves
$misse_cassy$ was previously separated from her son and daughter when they were sold unable to endure the pain of seeing another child sold she killed her third child
at this point $tom_loker$ returns to the story $tom_loker$ has changed as the result of being healed by the quakers
in louisiana uncle $tom_loker$ almost succumbs to hopelessness as his faith in god is tested by the hardships of the plantation
however he has two visions one of $lord_jesus$ and one of $miss_eva$ which renew his resolve to remain faithful christian even unto death
$george_harris$ $eliza_harris$ and $harry$ have also obtained their freedom after crossing into canada he encourages $misse_cassy$ to escape which she does taking $emmeline$ with her
when $tom_loker$ refuses to tell $simon_legree$ where $misse_cassy$ and $emmeline$ have gone $simon_legree$ orders his overseers to kill $tom_loker$ as $tom_loker$ is dying he forgives the overseers who savagely beat him

$misse_cassy$ discovers that $eliza_harris$ is her long lost daughter who was sold as child $george_harris$ $mr_shelby$ returns to the kentucky farm and frees all his slaves
$george_harris$ tells them to remember $tom_loker$ sacrifice and his belief in the true meaning of christianity uncle $tom_loker$ the title character was initially seen as noble long suffering christian slave
in more recent years however his name has become an epithet directed towards african americans who are accused of selling out to whites
throughout the book far from allowing himself to be exploited $tom_loker$ stands up for his beliefs and is grudgingly admired even by his enemies
$eliza_harris$ is slave and personal maid to mrs $mr_shelby$ who escapes to the north with her five year old son $harry$ after he is sold to $mr_haley$
her husband $george_harris$ eventually finds $eliza_harris$ and $harry$ in ohio and emigrates with them to canada then france and finally liberia
the character $eliza_harris$ was inspired by an #account# given at lane theological seminary in cincinnati by $john_bunyan$ rankin to stowe husband calvin professor at the school
according to rankin in february young slave #woman# $eliza_harris$ $george_harris$ had escaped across the frozen ohio river to the #town# of ripley with her child in her arms and stayed at his house on her #way# further north
stowe intended $tom_loker$ to be noble hero and praiseworthy person uncle $tom_loker$ and little $miss_eva$ painting by edwin longsden long evangeline $augustine_st_clare$ is the daughter of $augustine_st_clare$
$miss_eva$ enters the narrative when uncle $tom_loker$ is traveling via steamship to new orleans to be sold and he rescues the five or six year old girl from drowning
$miss_eva$ begs her father to buy $tom_loker$ and he becomes the #head# coachman at the $augustine_st_clare$ house he spends most of his time with the angelic $miss_eva$
$miss_eva$ often talks about love and forgiveness convincing the dour slave girl $topsy$ that she deserves love she even touches the heart of her aunt $miss_ophelia$
before dying she gives lock of her hair to each of the slaves telling them that they must become christians so that they may see each other in heaven
eventually $miss_eva$ falls terminally ill on her deathbed she convinces her father to free $tom_loker$ but because of circumstances the promise never materializes
a similar character also named little $miss_eva$ later appeared in the children novel little $miss_eva$ the flower of the south by philip cozans although this ironically was an anti $tom_loker$ novel
$simon_legree$ on the cover of the comic book adaptation of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin classic comics no $simon_legree$ is cruel slave owner a northerner by birth
his goal is to demoralize $tom_loker$ and break him of his religious faith he eventually orders $tom_loker$ whipped to death out of frustration for his slave unbreakable belief in god
the novel reveals that as young #man# he had abandoned his sickly #mother# for life at sea and ignored her letter to see her one last time at her deathbed
whose name has become synonymous with greed he is arguably the novel main antagonist he sexually exploits $misse_cassy$ who despises him and later sets his designs on $emmeline$
reports surfaced after the that stowe had in #mind# wealthy #cotton# and sugar plantation owner named meredith calhoun who settled on the red river north of alexandria louisiana
it is unclear if $simon_legree$ is based on any actual individuals generally however the personal characteristics of calhoun highly educated and refined do not match the uncouthness and brutality of $simon_legree$
calhoun even edited his own newspaper published in colfax originally calhoun landing which was renamed the national democrat after calhoun death
however calhoun overseers may have been in line with the hated $simon_legree$ methods and motivations these are the more notable of the secondary and minor characters in uncle $tom_loker$ cabin
she is deeply religious #woman# who strives to be kind and moral influence upon her slaves and is appalled when her husband sells his slaves with slave trader
arthur $mr_shelby$ $tom_loker$ master in kentucky $mr_shelby$ is characterized as kind slaveowner and stereotypical southern gentleman as #woman# she has no legal #way# to stop this as all property belongs to her husband
$george_harris$ $mr_shelby$ arthur and $emily$ son who sees $tom_loker$ as friend and as the perfect christian $aunt_chloe$ $tom_loker$ wife and #mother# of his children
after rocky courtship he marries #woman# he grows to hold in contempt though he is too polite to let it show
$augustine_st_clare$ $tom_loker$ third owner and father of $miss_eva$ $augustine_st_clare$ is complex often sarcastic with ready wit $augustine_st_clare$ recognizes the evil in chattel slavery but is not willing to relinquish the wealth it brings him
after his daughter death he becomes more sincere in his religious thoughts and starts to read the bible to $tom_loker$ he plans on finally taking action against slavery by freeing his slaves but his good intentions ultimately come to nothing
$marie_st_clare$ $augustine_st_clare$ wife of $augustine_st_clare$ she is self absorbed #woman# without hint of compassion for those around her including her own #family#
given to an unending list of apparently imaginary physical maladies she continually complains about the lack of sympathy she is receiving
she has separated her personal maid mammy from her own two children because they would interfere with her duties as $marie_st_clare$ drives mammy to exhaustion she criticizes her for selfishly seeking to attend her own #family#
upon the unexpected death of $augustine_st_clare$ $marie_st_clare$ countermands the legal process that would have given $tom_loker$ his freedom an intelligent and clever half white slave who is fiercely loyal to his #family#
$miss_eva$ and $topsy$ an literary poster by british lithographer louise corbaux when asked if she knows who made her she professes ignorance of both god and #mother# saying i pect growed
dont think #nobody# never made me she is transformed by $miss_eva$ love during the early to mid century several doll manufacturers created $topsy$ and $topsy$ type dolls
the phrase growed like $topsy$ later grew like $topsy$ passed into the english language originally with the specific meaning of unplanned growth later sometimes just meaning enormous growth
$miss_ophelia$ $augustine_st_clare$ pious hard working abolitionist cousin from vermont she displays the ambiguities towards african americans felt by many northerners at the time
she argues against the institution of slavery yet at least initially feels repulsed by the slaves as individuals $prue$ a depressed slave who was forced to let her child starve to death
she takes up drinking in her #misery# and is ultimately beaten and killed for it $quimbo$ and $sambo$ slaves of $simon_legree$ who act as overseers of the plantation

the fugitives are safe in free land illustration by hammatt billings for uncle $tom_loker$ cabin first edition the image shows $george_harris$ $eliza_harris$ $harry$ and mrs smyth after they escape to freedom
uncle $tom_loker$ cabin is dominated by single theme the evil and immorality of slavery she emphasizes the connections between these and the horrors of slavery
stowe sometimes changed the story voice so she could give homily on the destructive nature of slavery such as when white #woman# on the steamboat carrying $tom_loker$ further south states the most dreadful part of slavery to my #mind# is its outrages of feelings and affections the separating of #family# for example was how this peculiar institution forcibly separated #family# from each other
stowe made it somewhat subtle and in some cases she weaved it into events that would also support the dominant theme
one example of this is when $augustine_st_clare$ is killed he attempted to stop brawl between two inebriated #man# in cafe and was stabbed
one other example is the death of the slave #woman# $prue$ who was whipped to death for being drunk on consistent basis however her reasons for doing so is due to the loss of her baby
in the opening of the novel the fates of $eliza_harris$ and her son are being discussed between slave owners over wine
one of the subthemes presented in the novel is temperance considering that stowe intended this to be subtheme this scene could foreshadow future events that put alcohol in bad light
because stowe saw motherhood as the ethical and structural model for all of american life the united states from the demon of slavery another major theme of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin is the moral power and sanctity of #woman#
through characters like $eliza_harris$ who escapes from slavery to save her young son and eventually reunites her entire #family# or $miss_eva$ who is seen as the ideal christian stowe shows how she believed #woman# could save those around them from even the worst injustices
while later critics have noted that stowe female characters are often domestic clichés instead of realistic #woman# stowe novel reaffirmed the importance of #woman# influence and helped pave the #way# for the #woman# rights movement in the following decades
stowe puritanical religious beliefs show up in the novel final overarching theme the exploration of the nature of christianity and how she feels christian theology is fundamentally incompatible with slavery
this theme is most evident when $tom_loker$ urges $augustine_st_clare$ to look away to $lord_jesus$ after the death of $augustine_st_clare$ beloved daughter $miss_eva$
because christian themes play such large role in uncle $tom_loker$ cabin and because of stowe frequent use of direct authorial interjections on religion and faith the novel often takes the form of sermon
after $tom_loker$ dies $george_harris$ $mr_shelby$ eulogizes $tom_loker$ by saying what #thing# it is to be christian $eliza_harris$ crossing the icy river in an theatre poster
these genres were the most popular novels of stowe time and tended to #feature# female main characters and writing style which evoked #reader# sympathy and emotion
even though stowe novel differs from other sentimental novels by focusing on large theme like slavery and by having #man# as the main character she still set out to elicit certain strong feelings from her #reader#
uncle $tom_loker$ cabin is written in the sentimental and domestic fiction also called #woman# fiction the power in this type of writing can be seen in the reaction of contemporary #reader#
georgiana may friend of stowe wrote letter to the author saying i was up last #night# long after one clock reading and finishing uncle $tom_loker$ cabin
i could not leave it any more than could have left dying child another #reader# is described as obsessing on the book at all hours and having considered renaming her daughter $miss_eva$
evidently the death of little $miss_eva$ affected #lot# of people at that time because in baby girls in boston alone were given that name
despite this positive reaction from #reader# for decades literary critics dismissed the style found in uncle $tom_loker$ cabin and other sentimental novels because these books were written by #woman# and so prominently featured #woman# sloppy emotions
one literary critic said that had the novel not been about slavery it would be just another sentimental novel while another described the book as primarily derivative piece of hack #work#
in the literary history of the united states $george_harris$ whicher called uncle $tom_loker$ cabin sunday school fiction full of broadly conceived melodrama humor and pathos
however in $jane$ tompkins expressed different view of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin with her book in sensational designs the cultural #work# of american fiction
tompkins praised the style so many other critics had dismissed writing that sentimental novels showed how #woman# emotions had the power to change the world for the better
she also said that the popular domestic novels of the century including uncle $tom_loker$ cabin were remarkable for their intellectual complexity ambition and resourcefulness and that uncle $tom_loker$ cabin offers critique of american society far more devastating than any delivered by better known critics such as hawthorne and melville
writing in legal scholar richard posner described uncle $tom_loker$ cabin as part of the mediocre list of canonical #work# that emerges when political criteria are imposed on literature
this view remains the #subject# of dispute uncle $tom_loker$ cabin has exerted an influence equaled by few other novels in history
upon publication uncle $tom_loker$ cabin ignited firestorm of protest from defenders of slavery who created number of books in response to the novel while the book elicited praise from abolitionists
as best seller the novel heavily influenced later protest literature stowe responded to criticism by writing key to uncle $tom_loker$ cabin documenting the veracity of her novel depiction of slavery
uncle $tom_loker$ cabin outraged people in the american south the novel was also roundly criticized by slavery supporters acclaimed southern novelist william gilmore simms declared the #work# utterly false while others called the novel criminal and slanderous
to threatening letters sent to stowe including package containing slave severed #ear# many southern writers like simms soon wrote their own books in opposition to stowe novel
some critics highlighted stowe paucity of life experience relating to southern life saying that it led her to create inaccurate descriptions of the region
however stowe always said she based the characters of her book on stories she was told by runaway slaves in cincinnati
for instance she had never been to southern plantation it is reported that she observed firsthand several incidents which galvanized her to write famous anti slavery novel
scenes she observed on the ohio river including seeing husband and wife being sold apart as well as newspaper and magazine #account# and interviews contributed material to the emerging plot
in response to these criticisms in stowe published key to uncle $tom_loker$ cabin an attempt to document the veracity of the novel depiction of slavery
in the book stowe discusses each of the major characters in uncle $tom_loker$ cabin and cites real life equivalents to them while also mounting more aggressive attack on slavery in the south than the novel itself had
however while stowe claimed key to uncle $tom_loker$ cabin documented her previously consulted sources she actually read many of the cited #work# only after the publication of her novel
major part of the key was stowe critique of how the legal system supported slavery and licensed owners mistreatment of slaves
like the novel key to uncle $tom_loker$ cabin was best seller thus stowe put more than slavery on trial she put the law on trial
this continued an important theme of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin that the shadow of law brooded over the institution of slavery and allowed owners to mistreat slaves and then avoid punishment for their mistreatment
in some cases as stowe pointed out it even prevented kind owners from freeing their slaves despite these criticisms the novel still captured the imagination of many americans
according to stowe son when abraham lincoln met her in lincoln commented so this is the little lady who started this great war
historians are undecided if lincoln actually said this line and in letter that stowe wrote to her husband few hours after meeting with lincoln no mention of this comment was made and helping to fuel the abolitionist movement
union general and politician james baird weaver said that the book convinced him to become active in the abolitionist movement a sculpture after an design by louis samain was installed in on avenue louise in brussels
the scene a runaway black slave and child attacked by dogs was inspired by uncle $tom_loker$ cabin uncle $tom_loker$ cabin also created great interest in the united kingdom
the first london edition appeared in may and sold copies some of this interest was because of british antipathy to america
as one prominent writer explained the evil passions which uncle $tom_loker$ gratified in england were not hatred or vengeance but national jealousy and national vanity
we are tired of hearing her boast that she is the freest and the most enlightened country that the world has ever seen
we have long been smarting under the conceit of america our clergy hate her voluntary system our tories hate her democrats
our whigs hate her parvenus our radicals hate her litigiousness her insolence and her ambition all parties hailed mrs stowe as revolter from the enemy
charles francis adams the american minister to britain during the war argued later that uncle $tom_loker$ cabin or life among the lowly published in exercised largely from fortuitous circumstances more immediate considerable and dramatic world influence than any other book ever printed
a french edition translated by l carion or by louise swanton belloc appeared by published in cambrai and in paris
later it was translated into almost every major language including chinese with translator lin shu creating the first chinese translation of an american novel in and amharic with the translation created in support of ethiopian efforts to end the suffering of blacks in that nation
the book was so widely read that sigmund freud reported number of patients with sado masochistic tendencies who he believed had been influenced by reading about the whipping of slaves in uncle $tom_loker$ cabin
short article which was published in the oficial newspaper of the salvadoran government in july praised harriet beecher stowe and her book success
as the first widely read political novel in the united states uncle $tom_loker$ cabin greatly influenced development of not only american literature but also protest literature in general
later books which owe large debt to uncle $tom_loker$ cabin include the jungle by upton sinclair and silent spring by $rachel_halliday$ carson
which started the since then uninterrupted dialogue between american authors and slovene translators and #reader# despite this undisputed significance uncle $tom_loker$ cabin has been called a blend of children fable and propaganda
the novel has also been dismissed by number of literary critics as merely sentimental novel while critic $george_harris$ whicher stated in his literary history of the united states that nothing attributable to mrs stowe or her handiwork can #account# for the novel enormous vogue its author resources as purveyor of sunday school fiction were not remarkable
she had at most ready command of broadly conceived melodrama humor and pathos and of these popular sentiments she compounded her book
other critics though have praised the novel edmund wilson stated that to expose oneself in maturity to uncle $tom_loker$ cabin may prove startling experience
$jane$ tompkins states that the novel is one of the classics of american literature and wonders if many literary critics dismiss the book because it was simply too popular during its day
uncle $tom_loker$ and $miss_eva$ mass market staffordshire figure england glazed and painted earthenware over the years scholars have postulated number of theories about what stowe was trying to say with the novel aside from the obvious themes such as condemning slavery
some scholars have stated that stowe saw her novel as offering solution to the moral and political dilemma that troubled many slavery opponents whether engaging in prohibited behavior was justified in opposing evil
for example as an ardent christian and active abolitionist stowe placed many of her religious beliefs into the novel was the use of violence to oppose the violence of slavery and the breaking of proslavery laws morally defensible
stowe solution was similar to ralph waldo emerson god will would be followed if each person sincerely examined his principles and acted on them
which of stowe characters should be emulated the passive uncle $tom_loker$ or the defiant $george_harris$ scholars have also seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the free will movement
in this view the character of $george_harris$ embodies the principles of free labor while the complex character of $miss_ophelia$ represents those northerners who condoned compromise with slavery
during the course of the novel $miss_ophelia$ is transformed just as the republican party three years later proclaimed that the north must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles
feminist theory can also be seen at play in stowe book with the novel as critique of the patriarchal nature of slavery
for stowe blood relations rather than paternalistic relations between masters and slaves formed the basis of #family# moreover stowe viewed national solidarity as an extension of person #family# thus feelings of nationality stemmed from possessing shared race
consequently she advocated african colonization for freed slaves and not amalgamation into american society the book has also been seen as an attempt to redefine masculinity as necessary step toward the abolition of slavery
in this view abolitionists had begun to resist the vision of aggressive and dominant #man# that the conquest and colonization of the early century had fostered
in order to change the notion of manhood so that #man# could oppose slavery without jeopardizing their self image or their standing in society some abolitionists drew on principles of #woman# suffrage and christianity as well as passivism and praised #man# for cooperation compassion and civic spirit
others within the abolitionist movement argued for conventional aggressive masculine action all the #man# in stowe novel are representations of either one kind of #man# or the other
illustration of $sam$ from the new edition of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin the character of $sam$ helped create the stereotype of the lazy carefree happy darky
some modern scholars and #reader# have criticized the book for supposedly condescending racist descriptions of the black characters #appearance# speech and behavior as well as the passive nature of uncle $tom_loker$ in accepting his fate
is significant because uncle $tom_loker$ cabin was the best selling novel in the world during the century and associated stage productions was accused of playing major role in permanently ingraining such stereotypes into the american psyche
in the and the black power and black arts movements attacked the novel claiming that the character of uncle $tom_loker$ engaged in race betrayal and that $tom_loker$ made slaves out to be worse than slave owners
among the stereotypes of blacks in uncle $tom_loker$ cabin are the happy darky in the lazy carefree character of $sam$ the light skinned tragic #mulatto# as sex object in the characters of $eliza_harris$ $misse_cassy$ and $emmeline$ the affectionate dark skinned female mammy through several characters including mammy cook at the $augustine_st_clare$ plantation the pickaninny stereotype of black children in the character of $topsy$ the uncle $tom_loker$ an african american who is too eager to please white people
stowe intended $tom_loker$ to be noble hero and $jesus_christ$ like figure who like $lord_jesus$ at his crucifixion forgives the people responsible for his death
the false stereotype of $tom_loker$ as subservient fool who bows down to the white #man# and the resulting derogatory term uncle $tom_loker$ resulted from staged $tom_loker$ shows which replaced $tom_loker$ grim death with an upbeat ending where $tom_loker$ causes his oppressors to see the error of their #way# and they all reconcile happily
stowe had no control over these shows and their alteration of her story these negative associations have to some extent obscured the historical impact of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin as vital antislavery tool
james baldwin in essay everybody protest novel called uncle $tom_loker$ cabin very bad novel ruined by its self righteous virtuous sentimentality and stated that stowe was less novelist than an impassioned pamphleteer i propagandist for the antislavery cause as propaganda #work# it need not necessarily be great literature in order to succeed in its goals
in recent years however scholars such as $henry$ louis gates jr have re examined uncle $tom_loker$ cabin stating that the book is central document in american race relations and significant moral and political exploration of the character of those relations
title page for aunt phillis cabin by $mary$ eastman one of many examples of anti $tom_loker$ literature in response to uncle $tom_loker$ cabin writers in the southern united states produced number of books to rebut stowe novel
this so called anti $tom_loker$ literature generally took pro slavery viewpoint arguing that the issues of slavery as depicted in stowe book were overblown and incorrect
the novels in this genre tended to #feature# benign white patriarchal master and pure wife both of whom presided over childlike slaves in benevolent extended #family# style plantation
the novels either implied or directly stated that african americans were childlike people unable to live their lives without being directly overseen by white people
among the most famous anti $tom_loker$ books are the sword and the distaff by william gilmore simms aunt phillis cabin by $mary$ henderson eastman and the planter northern bride by caroline lee hentz with the last author having been close personal friend of stowe when the two lived in cincinnati
simms book was published few months after stowe novel and it contains number of sections and discussions disputing stowe book and her view of slavery
hentz novel widely read at the time but now largely forgotten offers defense of slavery as seen through the eyes of northern #woman#
in the decade between the publication of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin and the start of the american civil war between twenty and thirty anti $tom_loker$ books were published
the daughter of an abolitionist no less who marries southern slave owner among these novels are two books titled uncle $tom_loker$ cabin
as it is one by l smith and the other by h wiley and book by $john_bunyan$ pendleton kennedy
more than half of these anti $tom_loker$ books were written by white #woman# with simms commenting at one point about the seemingly poetic justice of having the northern #woman# stowe answered by southern #woman#
even though uncle $tom_loker$ cabin was the best selling novel of the century far more americans of that time saw the story as stage play or musical than read the book
eric lott in his book uncle tomitudes racial melodrama and modes of production estimates that at least three million people saw these plays ten times the book first year sales
stowe refused to authorize dramatization of her #work# because of her distrust of drama although she did eventually go to see $george_harris$ aiken version and according to francis underwood was delighted by caroline howard portrayal of $topsy$
stowe refusal to authorize particular dramatic version left the field clear for any number of adaptations some launched for various political reasons and others as simply commercial theatrical ventures
the book and plays were translated into several languages stowe received no money which could have meant as much as three fourths of her just and legitimate wages
aiken stage production was the most popular play in the s and england for years all of the $tom_loker$ shows appear to have incorporated elements of melodrama and blackface minstrelsy
these plays varied tremendously in their politics some faithfully reflected stowe sentimentalized antislavery politics while others were more moderate or even pro slavery
while number of productions also featured songs by stephen foster including my old kentucky home old #folk# at home and massa in the cold ground
the best known $tom_loker$ shows were those of $george_harris$ aiken and j the version by aiken is perhaps the best known stage adaptation released just few months after the novel was published
this six act behemoth also set an important precedent by being the first show on broadway to stand on its own without the performance of other entertainments or any afterpiece
most of aiken dialogue was taken verbatim from stowe novel and his adaptation included four full musical numbers written by the producer $george_harris$
another legacy of aiken version is its reliance upon very different locations all portrayed on the same stage this reliance led to large sets and set precedent for the future days of film
by combining this melodramatic approach with the content of stowe novel aiken helped to create powerful visual indictment against the institution of slavery
the many stage variants of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin dominated northern popular culture for several years during the century and the plays were still being performed in the early century
one of the unique and controversial variants of the $tom_loker$ shows was walt disney mickey mellerdrammer united artists film released in
the title is corruption of melodrama thought to harken back to the earliest minstrel shows as film short based on production of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin by the disney characters
by focusing on the stark and desperate situations of his characters aiken appealed to the emotions of his audiences in that film mickey mouse and friends stage their own production of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin
mickey mouse was already black colored but the advertising poster for the film shows mickey dressed in blackface with exaggerated orange lips bushy white sidewhiskers made out of #cotton# and his trademark white gloves
most of these movies were created during the silent film era uncle $tom_loker$ cabin was the most filmed book of that time period
because of the continuing popularity of both the book and $tom_loker$ shows audiences were already familiar with the characters and the plot making it easier for the film to be understood without spoken words

this film directed by edwin porter used white actors in blackface in the major roles and black performers only as extras
this version was evidently similar to many of the $tom_loker$ shows of earlier decades and featured numerous stereotypes about blacks such as having the slaves dance in almost any context including at slave auction
still from edwin porter version of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin which was one of the first full length movies in a three reel vitagraph company of america production was directed by stuart blackton and adapted by eugene mullin

until then full length movies of the time were minutes long and contained only one reel of film the movie starred florence turner $mary$ fuller edwin phillips flora finch genevieve tobin and carlyle blackwell sr
at least four more movie adaptations were created in the next two decades the last silent film version was released in
directed by $harry$ a pollard who played uncle $tom_loker$ in release of uncle $tom_loker$ cabin this two hour movie was more than year in production and was the third most expensive picture of the silent era at cost of million
the black actor charles gilpin was originally cast in the title role but he was fired after the studio decided his portrayal was too aggressive
the screenplay takes many liberties with the original book including altering the $eliza_harris$ and $george_harris$ subplot introducing the civil war and emancipation and combining the characters of $eliza_harris$ and $emmeline$
another difference occurs after $tom_loker$ dies $simon_legree$ is haunted by an apparitional vision of the late $tom_loker$ and falls to his death in futile effort to attack the ghostly image
james lowe took over the character of $tom_loker$ black media outlets of the time praised the film but the studio fearful of backlash from southern and white film audiences
ended up cutting out controversial scenes including the film opening sequence at slave auction in which #mother# is torn away from her baby
the story was adapted by harvey pollard thew and a younger with titles by walter anthony it starred james lowe virginia grey $george_harris$ siegmann margarita fischer mona ray and madame sul

this controversial film set the dramatic climax in slave cabin similar to that of uncle $tom_loker$ where several white southerners unite with their former enemy yankee soldiers to defend according to the film caption their aryan birthright
according to scholars this reuse of such familiar image of slave cabin would have resonated with and been understood by audiences of the time
