being in such close contact with mr_dimmesdale roger_chillingworth begins to suspect that the minister illness is the result of some unconfessed guilt

the letter a gules a red letter written on black background this section possibly contains original research please improve it by verifying the claims made and adding inline citations
the major theme of the scarlet letter is shaming and social stigmatizing both hester_prynne public humiliation and mr_dimmesdale private shame and fear of exposure
notably their liaison is never spoken of so the circumstances that lead to hester_prynne pregnancy and how their affair was kept secret never become part of the plot
elmer kennedy andrews remarks that hawthorne in the custom_house sets the context for his story and tells us about romance which is his preferred generic term to describe the scarlet letter as his subtitle for the book a romance would indicate
in this introduction hawthorne describes space between materialism and dreaminess that he calls a neutral territory somewhere between the real world and fairy land where the actual and the imaginary may meet and each imbues itself with nature of the other
statements consisting only of original research should be removed december learn how and when to remove this template message this combination of dreaminess and realism gave the author space to explore major themes
the experience of hester_prynne and mr_dimmesdale recalls the story of adam and eve because in both cases sin results in expulsion and suffering
but it also results in knowledge specifically in knowledge of what it means to be immoral for hester_prynne the scarlet letter is physical manifestation of her sin and reminder of her painful solitude
she contemplates casting it off to obtain her freedom from an oppressive society and checkered past as well as the absence of god
because the society excludes her she considers the possibility that many of the traditions upheld by the puritan culture are untrue and are not designed to bring her happiness
as for mr_dimmesdale the cheating minister his sin gives him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind so that his chest vibrate in unison with theirs
the narrative of the reverend arthur_dimmesdale mr_dimmesdale is quite in keeping with the oldest and most fully authorized principles in christian thought
his fall is descent from apparent grace to his own damnation he appears to begin in purity but he ends in corruption
the subtlety is that the minister belief is his own cheating convincing himself at every stage of his spiritual pilgrimage that he is saved
the rose bush beauty forms striking contrast to all that surrounds it as later the beautifully embroidered scarlet a will be held out in part as an invitation to find some sweet moral blossom in the ensuing tragic tale and in part as an image that the deep heart of nature perhaps god may look more kindly on the errant hester_prynne and her child than her puritan neighbors do
his eloquent and powerful sermons derive from this sense of empathy throughout the work the nature images contrast with the stark darkness of the puritans and their systems
roger_chillingworth misshapen body reflects or symbolizes the anger in his soul which builds as the novel progresses similar to the way mr_dimmesdale illness reveals his inner turmoil
the outward man reflects the condition of the heart an observation thought inspired by the deterioration of edgar allan poe whom hawthorne much admired
another theme is the extreme legalism of the puritans and how hester_prynne chooses not to conform to their rules and beliefs
hester_prynne was rejected by the villagers even though she spent her life doing what she could to help the sick and the poor
because of the social shunning she spent her life mostly in solitude and would not go to church as result she retreats into her own mind and her own thinking
her thought begin to stretch and go beyond what would be considered by the puritans as safe or even christian she still sees her sin but begins to look on it differently than the villagers ever have
she even goes so far as to tell mr_dimmesdale that their sin has been paid for by their daily penance and that their sin will not keep them from getting to heaven however the puritans believed that such sin surely condemns
she begins to believe that person earthly sins do not necessarily condemn them but hester_prynne had been alienated from the puritan society both in her physical life and spiritual life
when mr_dimmesdale dies she knows she has to move on because she can no longer conform to the puritans strictness her thinking is free from religious bounds and she has established her own different moral standards and beliefs

the following are symbols that are embedded in the scarlet letter the scarlet letter a in the beginning of the novel hester_prynne letter is representation of her sin and adultery
however as time progresses the meaning of the letter changed it now represented to some able it states the letter was the symbol of her calling
