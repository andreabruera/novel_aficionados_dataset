persuasion is the last novel fully completed by jane austen it was published at the end of six months after her death
the story concerns $miss_anne_elliot$ young englishwoman of #year# whose #family# is moving to lower their expenses and get out of debt
they rent their #home# to an admiral and his #wife# the #wife# #brother# navy captain $frederick_wentworth$ $mr_wentworth$ had been engaged to $miss_anne_elliot$ in
this sets the scene for many humorous encounters as well as second well considered chance at love and marriage for $miss_anne_elliot$ in her second bloom
and now they meet again both single and unattached after no contact in more than seven #year# the novel was well received in the early century
greater fame came later in the century continued in the century and through to the century much scholarly debate on austen work has since been published
as persuasion is austen last completed novel it is accepted as her most maturely written novel showing refinement of literary conception indicative of #woman# approaching forty #year# of age
unlike sense and sensibility and pride and prejudice persuasion was not rewritten from earlier drafts of novels that austen had originally started before
$miss_anne_elliot$ is noteworthy among austen heroines for her relative maturity her use of free indirect discourse in narrative was by in full evidence
the first edition of persuasion was co published with the previously unpublished northanger abbey in late december given on the title page as the second two volumes of four volume set with preface for the first #time# publicly identifying austen as the author of all her novels
neither northanger abbey nor persuasion was published under the working title austen used the later editions of both were published separately
four made for television adaptations of the novel were made in britain beginning in with mini series featuring daphne slater in persuasion
the next starred ann firbank in the lead role in the version co starring bryan marshall amanda root starred in the version co starring ciarán hinds and sally hawkins starred in the version co starring rupert penry jones and made for itv

in #letter# to her niece fanny knight in march austen wrote about persuasion that she had novel which may appear about twelvemonth hence
john murray published persuasion together with northanger abbey in four volume set printed in december but dated the first advertisement appeared on december
henry austen supplied biographical notice of his #sister# in which her identity is revealed and she is no longer an anonymous author
the canadian scholar sheila johnson kindred suggested #part# of the novel were inspired by the career of austen #brother# $mrs_charles_musgrove$ austen royal navy officer as there are some similarities between the career of the real #life# captain austen and the fictional captain $mr_wentworth$ both began their careers in command of sloops in the north america station at about the same age both were popular with their crews both progressed to the command of frigates and both were keen to share their prize money with their crews though captain $mr_wentworth$ ended up considerably richer as result of his prize money than did captain austen
likewise captain austen #wife# fanny whom he married in bermuda in bears some similarities to $mrs_croft$ who like fanny austen lived aboard naval vessels for #time# lived alternatively in bermuda and halifax the two ports that hosted the royal navy north america station and crossed the atlantic five #time# though $mrs_croft$ was middle aged in the novel while fanny austen was when she married captain austen
even after the outbreak of the war of fanny austen was anxious to follow her husband back to the north america station despite the danger of american attacks on bermuda and halifax which jane austen was impressed with seeing her desire to be with her husband no matter the danger as an attractive trait and likewise it is made clear that $mrs_croft$ had followed her husband everywhere despite the dangers
although readers of persuasion might conclude that austen intended persuasion to be the unifying theme of the story the book title is not hers but her #brother# henry who named it after her untimely death
jane austen liked fanny austen whom she admired for her unfussiness and gallant good sense certainly the #idea# of persuasion runs through the book with vignettes within the story as variations on that theme
whatever her intentions might have been she spoke of it as the elliots according to #family# tradition and some critics believe that is probably the title she planned for it
on the #other# #hand# the literary scholar gillian beer establishes that austen had profound concerns about the levels and applications of persuasion employed in society especially as it related to the pressures and choices facing the young #woman# of her #day#
but there is no known source that documents what austen intended to call her novel beer writes that for austen and her readers persuasion was indeed fraught with moral dangers xv
she notes particularly that austen personally was appalled by what she came to regard as her own misguided advice to her beloved niece fanny knight on the very question of whether fanny ought to accept particular suitor even though it would have meant protracted engagement
she refuses to become #part# of the machinery with which fanny is manoeuvering herself into forming the engagement to be the stand in motive for another actions frightens her
yet jane austen cannot avoid the #part# of persuader even as dissuader fanny ultimately rejected her suitor and after her aunt death married someone else
thus beer explains austen was keenly aware that the human quality of persuasion to persuade or to be persuaded rightly or wrongly is fundamental to the process of human communication and that in her novel jane austen gradually draws out the implications of discriminating just and unjust persuasion
indeed the narrative winds through number of situations in which #people# are influencing or attempting to influence #other# #people# or themselves
finally beer calls attention to the novel entire brooding on the power pressures the seductions and also the new pathways opened by persuasion
main article reception history of jane austen a walton litz in the essay titled persuasion forms of estrangement gives concise summary of the various issues critics have raised with persuasion as novel
persuasion has received highly intelligent criticism in recent #year# after long period of comparative neglect and the lines of investigation have followed virginia woolf suggestive comments
critics have been concerned with the personal quality of the novel and the problems it poses for biographical interpretation with the obvious unevenness in narrative structure with the poetic use of landscape and the hovering influence of romantic poetry with the pervasive presence of $miss_anne_elliot$ consciousness with new effects in style and syntax with the modernity of $miss_anne_elliot$ an isolated personality in rapidly changing society
the literary scholar stuart tave in his essay concerning the main #character# $miss_anne_elliot$ in persuasion concentrated on the melancholy qualities of her reality in her #world# after she turns away the original proposal of marriage from captain $mr_wentworth$
for tave austen portrays $miss_anne_elliot$ as #character# with many admirable traits usually exceeding the quality of these traits as they are found in the #other# #character# which surround her
tave singles out austen portrayal of $miss_anne_elliot$ at the end of the novel in her conversation with captain $mrs_harville$ where the two of them discuss the relative virtues of gender and their advantages compared to #one# another and tave sees $miss_anne_elliot$ as depicting remarkable intelligence
it was strange to think that all the great #woman# of fiction were until jane austen #day# not only seen by the #other# sex but seen only in relation to the #other# sex
tave applies woolf insight to persuasion when he continues all histories are against you captain $mrs_harville$ says to $miss_anne_elliot$ in their disagreement about #man# nature and #woman# nature all stories prose and verse
tave quotes from virginia woolf in her book #room# of #one# own where woolf states he could bring fifty quotations in #moment# to his #side# of the argument from books songs proverbs
but they were all written by #man# #man# have had every advantage of us in telling their own story as $miss_anne_elliot$ says
in her book on austen the critic julia prewitt brown found significance in the comparison of persuasion to austen earlier novel emma regarding austen ability to vary her narrative technique with respect to her authorial intentions
the coolness to the reader conveyed by austen narrative contrasts with an intensity of #feeling# for the #character# in the story particularly for the heroine
persuasion is the story told by #woman# the reason for this contradiction is that $miss_anne_elliot$ is the central intelligence of the novel
sir $william_walter_elliot$ is seen as $miss_anne_elliot$ sees him with resigned contempt for the first #time# jane austen gives over the narrator authority to #character# almost completely
in emma many events and situations are seen from emma point of view but the central intelligence lies somewhere between the narrator and the reader who together see that emma sees wrongly
in persuasion $miss_anne_elliot$ #feeling# and evaluations correspond to those of the narrator in almost every situation although there are several significant lapses
it seems that this transfer of authority placed strain on jane austen accustomed narrative tendencies and that she could not maintain it completely
susan morgan in her book on austen challenges litz on naming persuasion as novel showing austen assimilation of the new romantic poetry as this raises difficulties
litz commenting on the deeply physical impact of persuasion remarks that mansfield park is about the loss and return of principles emma about the loss and return of reason persuasion about the loss and return of bloom
litz acknowledges the crudeness of these formulations and we recognize that he is attempting to discuss quality of the novel which is hard to describe
the few brief nature scenes in persuasion and they are brief out of all proportion to the commentary on them the walk to winthrop and the environs of pinny and lyme are certainly described with sensibility and appreciation
but such summaries even tentatively offered only distort and in $miss_anne_elliot$ #mind# they are just as certainly bound up with the sweets of poetical despondence
although the impact of austen failing health at the #time# of writing persuasion cannot be overlooked the novel is strikingly original in several #way#
it is the first of austen novels to feature as the central #character# #woman# who by the standards of the #time# is past the first bloom of youth
the british literacy critic robert irvine wrote about persuasion that it is in many #way# radical departure from austen earlier novels
austen biographer claire tomalin characterises the book as austen present to herself to miss sharp to cassandra to martha lloyd to all #woman# who had lost their chance in #life# and would never enjoy second spring
the scholar robert irvine noted that alone of austen novels non event at the beginning of the novel where $miss_anne_elliot$ did not marry captain $mr_wentworth$ shapes the rest of the plot as the hero and heroine must defeat the consequences of their shared history
unlike the #other# austen heroes who are either #part# of the gentry the aristocracy or the church of england captain $mr_wentworth$ is self made #man# who has become rich via prize money won at sea allowed to those who served in the royal navy of that era
sir $william_walter_elliot$ disparages naval officers like $mr_wentworth$ and $mrs_croft$ because they spoil their complexions outside on the sea and snobbishly says they have risen too quickly in social status but he is portrayed as financially incompetent having squandered his inherited wealth whereas $mr_wentworth$ uses his prize money won via his victories at sea wisely
coming right after britain victory in the long wars with france sir $william_walter_elliot$ dismissal of the navy #man# who played such prominent role in finally defeating napoleon sounds very unpatriotic and ungrateful
the scholar gary kelly suggested the sir $william_walter_elliot$ is stand in for the notoriously spendthrift and snobbish prince regent george a #man# whom austen deeply disliked as the prince of wales was infamous for his womanising gambling drinking and inability to pay his colossal debts
at the #time# there was widespread belief that britain had defeated france despite the debauched prince regent rather than because of him and kelly argued that #character# like sir $william_walter_elliot$ who did #nothing# to defeat napoleon attacking someone like $mr_wentworth$ was austen #way# of expressing her frustration at the prince regent taking all the credit for defeating napoleon
unlike the #other# books the couple once married did not become #part# of the land owning gentry with the novel merely saying they were destined for settled #life#
irvine argued that the sailors in persuasion were the most subversive #character# in all of the austen books as they possess national importance as the book phrases it only by the virtue of their role in defeating napoleon and do not own land nor do they ask for social recognition from the gentry
the royal navy in persuasion is meritocracy where #one# rises up via #one# talents not via birth and land which irvine argued makes persuasion the most radical of all of austen novels
irvine noted that the gentry #character# in persuasion are an unimpressive lot as sir $william_walter_elliot$ eliot is portrayed as vain pompous windbag incapable of providing love for his #child# while the $mrs_charles_musgrove$ #family# are lacking in class and elegance
in its turn the narrowness of vision and taste on both the $miss_musgroves$ and sir $william_walter_elliot$ served to highlight the heightened state of $miss_anne_elliot$ consciousnesses
admiral and $mrs_croft$ are not planning on buying an estate being content to rent $kellynch_hall$ and are described as taking better care of the estate than sir $william_walter_elliot$ whose #family# has owned $kellynch_hall$ for three generations
$mrs_charles_musgrove$ through friendly and respectable is portrayed as unsuitable for $miss_anne_elliot$ as his only #interest# are guns hunting dogs and horses
in british fiction at the #time# it was normal plot device for #woman# who were portrayed as being more sensitive and poetical than #man# to improve someone like $mrs_charles_musgrove$ and show him that there was more to #life# than hunting but $miss_anne_elliot$ rejects this role and the narrator suggests that she was right to do so
the marriage of $miss_anne_elliot$ parents is presented as such match with $miss_anne_elliot$ #mother# attempting to improve sir $william_walter_elliot$ and her #life# become thoroughly miserable as result
however the possibility of such marriage seems to exist for captain $james_benwick$ and $louisa_musgrove$ $mrs_charles_musgrove$ as the narrator notes he would gain cheerfulness and she would learn to be an enthusiast for scott and lord byron
$james_benwick$ and $miss_anne_elliot$ are similar #character# who have profound sense of loss but $miss_anne_elliot$ #heart# still belongs to captain $mr_wentworth$ while about $james_benwick$
sir $william_walter_elliot$ obsessively reads books relating only to the baronetage and the $mrs_charles_musgrove$ #family# are relentlessly philistine in their tastes the narrator says he is younger in #feeling# if not in fact younger as #man#
unlike austen #other# books where the plot depends on the #character# changing in persuasion it depends upon the main #character# remaining the same
the need for the #character# to remain true to themselves to cherish the memory of the #one# they love is emphasized by the signs of social decay around $miss_anne_elliot$ as the gentry #character# neglect their estates and treat with contempt the values they are supposed to uphold with $miss_anne_elliot$ love for $mr_wentworth$ being the only fixed point in an otherwise fluid #world#
another contrast to the #other# austen novels where conversation was means for members of the elite to confirm their membership of common group is that the key #moment# occur when third #party# overhears somebody else conversation
the first #time# is when $louisa_musgrove$ $mrs_charles_musgrove$ talks to $mr_wentworth$ about how admiral $mrs_croft$ cannot drive carriage well which leads her to say
if loved #man# as she loves the admiral would be always with him #nothing# should ever separate us and would rather be overturned by him than driven safely by anybody else
overhearing this conversation brings back $miss_anne_elliot$ memories of her love for $mr_wentworth$ and brings her sorrow as she fears that he is falling in love with $louisa_musgrove$
captain $mr_wentworth$ tries to hide his #feeling# at #one# point protesting that $miss_anne_elliot$ power with him was gone forever little too vehemently to suggest the precise opposite
the second overheard conversation is the climax when $miss_anne_elliot$ debates captain $mrs_harville$ over the respective capacity for faithfulness of #man# and #woman# which $mr_wentworth$ overhears
realizing that $mr_wentworth$ is listening in $miss_anne_elliot$ says all the privilege claim for my own sex it is not very enviable #one# you need not covet it is that of loving longest when existence or when hope is gone could not immediately have uttered another sentence her #heart# was too full her breath too much oppressed
as captain $mr_wentworth$ fears second rejection by $miss_anne_elliot$ much of the novel is concerned with incidents that bring the two together and relies upon relating $miss_anne_elliot$ psychological state as she comes close to the #man# who once proposed marriage to her making more of psychological study
in contrast to the dashwood #sister# sense and sensibility and the bennet #sister# pride and prejudice $miss_anne_elliot$ is not close to her #sister#
he will rally again and be happy with another $lady_russell$ is the #one# who persuaded her to reject captain $mr_wentworth$ first offer of marriage when $miss_anne_elliot$ was younger
$lady_russell$ never expresses any guilt about breaking up $miss_anne_elliot$ relationship with $mr_wentworth$ as the book describes her #heart# revelled in angry #pleasure# in pleased contempt
$miss_anne_elliot$ becomes steadily more assertive telling mr $miss_anne_elliot$ at #one# point my #idea# of good #company# mr $miss_anne_elliot$ is the #company# of clever well informed #people# who have great #deal# of conversation that is what call good #company#
the climax of the book where $miss_anne_elliot$ speaks of love knowing that $mr_wentworth$ is listening is unique in the austen novels in that the heroine in certain sense proposes marriage to the hero
the american scholar adela pinch wrote that persuasion has been called the most lyrical of austen novels writing its emphasis on memory and subjectivity has been called wordsworthian its emotional tone has been likened to shelley and keats and its epistemological strategies compared to coleridge conversation poems
$mr_wentworth$ is #man# of action as opposed to #word# which makes $miss_anne_elliot$ the only self reflective #character# in the novel its modernity has been hinted through allusions to the lyric fiction of virginia woolf
a recurring debate held in century britain concerned the power of books over #woman# namely were #woman# more susceptible to the power of reading than #man# and if so was reading benign or malign influence on #woman#
austen had first taken up this question in northanger abbey where reading gothic books has comic effects on catherine morland but also gives more acute sense of reality and to understand #people#
pinch wrote that austen returned to this theme of the power of books on #woman# in persuasion but in more mature and probing #manner# where as the novel is concerned with what it feels like to be reader
it explores that is the influence reading can have on #one# #mind# by comparing it to the influence of #one# #person# #mind# over another
pinch wrote that austen is more concerned with spatial matters as various #family# especially the $mrs_charles_musgrove$ #family# are portrayed in terms of the amount of space they take up and the amount of noise they generate
likewise captain $mr_wentworth$ and $miss_anne_elliot$ are divided at #one# point from embracing by grossly obese $mrs_charles_musgrove$ or sir $william_walter_elliot$ comments after seeing some royal navy sailors are fit not to be seen as austen more concerned than usual with how #people# look and the brain registers visual information
it does so by connecting this #feeling# to what the presence of #other# #people# feel like pinch described persuasion as novel of repetitions of #thing# happening within strong context of memory
$miss_anne_elliot$ is so often lost in her own #world# of thought that recurring phrase throughout the book is $miss_anne_elliot$ found herself
concerning $miss_anne_elliot$ walk at winthrop on november #day# $miss_anne_elliot$ ruminates on various aspects of her #life# and of the books she has read where austen seems to suggest that reading books is insufficient consolation for #woman# pain but also unavoidable if #one# wishes for her comfort
it features heroine who is generally unappreciated and to some degree exploited by those around her handsome prince who appears on the scene but seems more interested in the more obvious charms of #other# #moment# of realisation and the final happy ending
it has been said that it is not that $miss_anne_elliot$ is unloved but rather that those around her no longer see her clearly she is such fixed #part# of their #life# that her likes and dislikes wishes and dreams are no longer considered even by those who claim to value her like $lady_russell$
a walton litz has emphasized the special quality of austen persuasion among her novels in that it was written over relatively narrow space of two or three #year# from start to finish
almost all of austen novels were written in the form of first drafts now lost from before over decade before their first publication in the last #year# of austen #life#
since persuasion was written over such narrow #time# frame litz was able to locate and publish the early handwritten drafts of austen as she refined the text of the novel into its final published form showing her meticulous attention to detail in editing her own writing
litz citing the research of norman page gives an example of austen meticulous editing by excerpting passage of austen cancelled chapter ten of the novel and comparing it to the revised version
the novel is described in the introduction to the penguin classics edition as great cinderella story in its original version the manuscript stated he found that he was considered by his #friend# $mrs_harville$ an engaged #man#
the $harvilles$ entertained not doubt of mutual attachment between him and $louisa_musgrove$ and though this to degree was contradicted instantly it yet made him feel that perhaps by her #family# by everybody by herself even the same #idea# might be held and that he was not free in honour though if such were to be the conclusion too free alas
he had never thought justly on this subject before and he had not sufficiently considered that his excessive intimacy at $uppercross_cottage$ must have its danger of ill consequence in many #way# and that while trying whether he could attach himself to either of the girls he might be exciting unpleasant reports if not raising unrequited regard
he found too late that he had entangled himself cancelled version as published in chapman edition of austen litz then gives the final version by austen i found
said he that was considered by $mrs_harville$ an engaged #man# that neither $mrs_harville$ nor his #wife# entertained doubt of our mutual attachment
to degree could contradict this instantly but when began to reflect that #other# might have felt the same her own #family# nay perhaps herself was no longer at my own disposal
i had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its danger of ill consequence in many #way# and that had no right to be trying whether could attach myself to either of the girls at the risk of raising even an unpleasant report were there no #other# ill effects
i was hers in honour if she wished it i had not thought seriously on this subject before i had been grossly wrong and must abide the consequences
to this may be added the surviving version of austen handwritten copy of the original draft before the editing process outlined above had even started where austen wrote it in the following nascent form he found that he was considered by his #friend# $mrs_harville$ as an engaged #man#
the $harvilles$ entertained not doubt of mutual attachment between him $louisa_musgrove$ and though this to degree was contradicted instantly it yet made him feel that perhaps by her #family# be everyone by herself even the same #idea# might be held and that he was not free alas in #heart# he had never thought justly on this subject before he had not sufficiently considered that this excessive intimacy at $uppercross_cottage$ must have it danger of ill consequence in many #way# and that while trying whether he d sic attach himself to either of the girls he might be exciting unpleasant reports if not raising unrequited regard he found too late that he had entangled himself
persuasion is unique among austen novels in allowing such close inspection as recorded by litz of her editorial prowess in revising and enhancing early drafts of her own writing
he found too late in short that he had entangled himself final version persuasion has been the subject of several adaptations
it has rarely been the first of austen novels to travel into new form of popular media but it does appear to be the first of her stories turned erotica with roger longrigg virtues and vices delectable rondelet of love and lust in edwardian #time# a bawdy comic retelling of persuasion set century after the original
