the legend of sleepy hollow is gothic #story# by american author washington irving contained in his collection of essays and short #story# entitled the sketch book of geoffrey crayon gent
the short #story# read by chip from the librivox project written while irving was living abroad in birmingham england the legend of sleepy hollow was first published in
along with irving companion piece rip van winkle the legend of sleepy hollow is among the earliest examples of american fiction with enduring popularity especially during halloween because of character known as the headless horseman believed to be hessian soldier who was decapitated by cannonball in battle
the #story# is set in in the countryside around the dutch settlement of tarry town historical tarrytown new york in secluded glen called sleepy hollow
sleepy hollow is renowned for its ghosts and the haunting atmosphere that pervades the imaginations of its inhabitants and visitors some residents say this town was bewitched during the early days of the dutch settlement
other residents say an old native american chief the wizard of his tribe held his powwows here before the #country# was discovered by master hendrick hudson
the most infamous spectre in the hollow is the headless horseman said to be the ghost of hessian trooper who had his #head# shot off by stray cannonball during some nameless battle of the american revolutionary war and who rides forth to the scene of battle in nightly quest of his #head#
the legend relates the tale of $ichabod_crane$ lean lanky and extremely superstitious schoolmaster from connecticut who competes with abraham $brom_bones$ van brunt the town rowdy for the hand of year old katrina $baltus_van_tassel$ the daughter and sole child of wealthy farmer $baltus_van_tassel$
$brom_bones$ the local hero vies with $ichabod_crane$ for katrina hand playing series of pranks on the jittery schoolmaster and the fate of sleepy hollow fortune weighs in the balance for some #time#
$ichabod_crane$ yankee and an outsider sees marriage to katrina as means of procuring $baltus_van_tassel$ extravagant wealth the tension among the three is soon brought to #head#
he dances partakes in the feast and listens to ghostly legends told by $brom_bones$ and the locals but his true aim is to propose to katrina after the guests leave
on placid autumn night the ambitious $ichabod_crane$ attends harvest party at the van tassels homestead his intentions however are ill fated
after having failed to secure katrina hand $ichabod_crane$ rides home heavy hearted and crestfallen through the woods between $baltus_van_tassel$ farmstead and the sleepy hollow settlement
as he passes several purportedly haunted spots his active imagination is engorged by the ghost #story# told at baltus harvest party
after nervously passing under lightning stricken tulip #tree# purportedly haunted by the ghost of british spy major andré $ichabod_crane$ encounters cloaked rider at an intersection in menacing swamp
unsettled by his fellow traveler eerie size and silence the teacher is horrified to discover that his companion #head# is not on his shoulders but on his saddle
in frenzied race to the bridge adjacent to the old dutch burying ground where the hessian is said to vanish according to rule in flash of fire and brimstone upon crossing it $ichabod_crane$ rides for his life desperately goading his temperamental plow horse down the hollow
however to $ichabod_crane$ horror the ghoul clambers over the bridge rears his horse and hurls his severed #head# into $ichabod_crane$ terrified face
the schoolmaster attempts to duck beneath the terrible missile but is too late when it strikes his #head# and sends him tumbling headlong into the dust
the next morning $ichabod_crane$ has mysteriously disappeared from town leaving katrina to marry $brom_bones$ who was said to look exceedingly knowing whenever the #story# of $ichabod_crane$ was related
although the true nature of both the headless horseman and $ichabod_crane$ disappearance that night are left open to interpretation the #story# implies that the ghost was really $brom_bones$ an agile stunt rider in disguise and suggests that $ichabod_crane$ was knocked off his horse and immediately fled sleepy hollow never to return there again
irving narrator concludes the #story# however by stating that the old dutch wives continue to promote the belief that $ichabod_crane$ was spirited away by supernatural means and legend develops around his disappearance and sightings of his melancholy spirit
the headless horseman pursuing $ichabod_crane$ by john quidor irving wrote the sketch book during tour of europe and parts of the tale may also be traced to european origins
headless horsemen were staples of northern european storytelling featuring in german irish g dullahan scandinavian g the wild hunt and english legends and were included in robert burns poem
indeed the only relics of the schoolmaster flight are his wandering horse trampled saddle discarded hat and mysterious shattered pumpkin tam shanter and bürger der wilde jäger translated as the wild huntsman
usually viewed as omens of ill fortune for those who chose to disregard their apparitions these specters found their victims in proud scheming persons and characters with hubris and arrogance
during the height of the american revolutionary war irving writes that the #country# surrounding tarry town was one of those highly favored places which abound with chronicle and great men
the british and american line had run near it during the war it had therefore been the scene of marauding and infested with refugees cow boys and all kinds of border chivalry
after the battle of white plains in october the #country# south of the bronx river was abandoned by the continental army and occupied by the british
the americans were fortified north of peekskill leaving westchester county mile stretch of scorched and desolated no man land vulnerable to outlaws raiders and vigilantes
besides droves of loyalist rangers and british light infantry hessian jägers renowned sharpshooters and horsemen were among the raiders who often skirmished with patriot militias
the headless horseman said to be decapitated hessian soldier may have indeed been based loosely on the discovery of just such jäger headless corpse found in sleepy hollow after violent skirmish and later buried by the $baltus_van_tassel$ family in an unmarked grave in the old dutch burying ground
the dénouement of the fictional tale is set at the bridge over the pocantico river in the area of the old dutch church and burying ground in sleepy hollow
irving while he was an aide de camp to new york gov daniel tompkins met an army captain named $ichabod_crane$ in sackets harbor new york during an inspection tour of fortifications in
irving may have patterned the character in the legend after jesse merwin who taught at the local schoolhouse in kinderhook further north along the hudson river where irving spent several months in
one particularly influential rendition of this folktale was recorded by the german folklorist karl musäus the inspiration for the character of katrina $baltus_van_tassel$ was based on an actual young woman named katrina $baltus_van_tassel$
washington irving stayed with her family for short #time# and asked permission to use her name and loosely base the character on her
he told her and her family he liked to give his characters the names of people he had met $ichabod_crane$ respectfully dedicated to washington irving
the #story# was the longest one published as part of the sketch book of geoffrey crayon gent commonly referred to as the sketch book which irving issued serially throughout and using the pseudonym geoffrey crayon
william wilgus artist chromolithograph with rip van winkle the legend of sleepy hollow is one of irving most anthologized studied and adapted sketches
both #story# are often paired together in books and other representations and both are included in surveys of early american literature and romanticism
irving depictions of regional culture and his themes of progress versus tradition supernatural intervention in the commonplace and the plight of the individual outsider in an homogeneous community permeate both #story# and helped to develop unique sense of american cultural and existential selfhood during the early century
