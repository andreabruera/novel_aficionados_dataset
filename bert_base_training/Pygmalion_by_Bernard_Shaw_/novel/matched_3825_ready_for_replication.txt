in the printed version of this text all apostrophes for contractions such as cant wouldnt and he were omitted to read as cant wouldnt and hed
as will be seen later on pygmalion needs not a preface but a sequel which i have supplied in its due place
pygmalion bernard shaw transcriber note this etext edition restores the omitted apostrophes preface to pygmalion a professor of #phonetic# the english have no respect for their language and will not teach their children to speak it
they spell it so abominably that no #man# can teach himself what it sounds like it is impossible for an englishman to open his mouth without making some other englishman hate or despise him
the reformer england needs today is an energetic #phonetic# enthusiast that is why i have made such a one the hero of a popular play
german and spanish are accessible to foreigners english is not accessible even to englishmen there have been heroes of that kind crying in the wilderness for many years past
when i became interested in the subject towards the end of the eighteen seventies melville bell was dead but alexander ellis was still a living patriarch with an impressive head always covered by a velvet skull cap for which he would apologize to public meetings in a very courtly #manner#
$henry_higgins$ sweet then a young #man# lacked their sweetness of #character# he was about as conciliatory to conventional mortals as ibsen or samuel butler
his great ability as a phonetician he was i think the best of them all at his job would have entitled him to high official recognition and perhaps enabled him to popularize his subject but for his satanic contempt for all academic dignitaries and persons in general who thought more of greek than of #phonetic#
once in the days when the imperial institute rose in south kensington and joseph chamberlain was booming the empire i induced the editor of a leading monthly review to commission an article from sweet on the imperial importance of his subject
when it arrived it contained nothing but a savagely derisive attack on a professor of language and literature whose chair sweet regarded as proper to a #phonetic# expert only
the article being libelous had to be returned as impossible and i had to renounce my dream of dragging its author into the limelight
when i met him afterwards for the first time for many years i found to my astonishment that he who had been a quite tolerably presentable young #man# had actually managed by sheer scorn to alter his personal appearance until he had become a sort of walking repudiation of oxford and all its traditions
it must have been largely in his own despite that he was squeezed into something called a readership of #phonetic# there
the future of #phonetic# rests probably with his pupils who all swore by him but nothing could bring the #man# himself into any sort of compliance with the university to which he nevertheless clung by divine #right# in an intensely oxonian #way#
i daresay his papers if he has left any include some satires that may be published without too destructive results fifty years hence
he was i believe not in the least an ill natured #man# very much the opposite i should say but he would not suffer fools gladly
those who knew him will recognize in my third act the allusion to the patent shorthand in which he used to write postcards and which may be acquired from a four and six penny manual published by the clarendon press
he and tito pagliardini another #phonetic# veteran were #man# whom it was impossible to dislike the postcards which $mrs_higgins$ describes are such as i have received from sweet
i would decipher a sound which a cockney would represent by zerr and a frenchman by seu and then write demanding with some heat what on earth it meant
sweet with boundless contempt for my stupidity would reply that it not only meant but obviously was the word result as no other word containing that sound and capable of making sense with the context existed in any language spoken on earth
therefore though the whole point of his current shorthand is that it can express every sound in the language perfectly vowels as well as consonants and that your hand has to make no stroke except the easy and current ones with which you write n and l and scribbling them at whatever angle comes easiest to you his unfortunate determination to make this remarkable and quite legible script serve also as a shorthand reduced it in his own practice to the most inscrutable of cryptograms
his true objective was the provision of a full accurate legible script for our noble but ill dressed language but he was led past that by his contempt for the popular pitman system of shorthand which he called the pitfall system
the triumph of pitman was a triumph of business organization there was a weekly paper to persuade you to learn pitman there were cheap textbooks and exercise books and transcripts of speeches for you to copy and schools where experienced teachers coached you up to the necessary proficiency
that less expert mortals should require fuller indications was beyond sweet patience sweet could not organize his market in that fashion
the four and six penny manual mostly in his lithographed handwriting that was never vulgarly advertized may perhaps some day be taken up by a syndicate and pushed upon the public as the times pushed the encyclopaedia britannica but until then it will certainly not prevail against pitman
i have bought three copies of it during my lifetime and i am informed by the publishers that its cloistered existence is still a steady and healthy one
i actually learned the system two several times and yet the shorthand in which i am writing these lines is pitman
he might as well have been the sybil who tore up the leaves of prophecy that nobody would attend to and the reason is that my secretary cannot transcribe sweet having been perforce taught in the schools of pitman
therefore sweet railed at pitman as vainly as thersites railed at ajax his raillery however it may have eased his soul gave no popular vogue to current shorthand
pygmalion $mrs_higgins$ is not a portrait of sweet to whom the adventure of $eliza_doolittle$ would have been impossible still as will be seen there are touches of sweet in the play
as it was he impressed himself professionally on europe to an extent that made his comparative personal obscurity and the failure of oxford to do justice to his eminence a puzzle to foreign specialists in his subject
i do not blame oxford because i think oxford is quite #right# in demanding a certain social amenity from its nurslings heaven knows it is not exorbitant in its requirements
for although i well know how hard it is for a #man# of genius with a seriously underrated subject to maintain serene and kindly relations with the #man# who underrate it and who keep all the best places for less important subjects which they profess without originality and sometimes without much capacity for them still if he overwhelms them with wrath and disdain he cannot expect them to heap honors on him
with $mrs_higgins$ physique and temperament sweet might have set the thames on fire of the later generations of phoneticians i know little
among them towers the poet laureate to whom perhaps $mrs_higgins$ may owe his miltonic sympathies though here again i must disclaim all portraiture
but if the play makes the public aware that there are such people as phoneticians and that they are among the most important people in england at present it will serve its turn
i wish to boast that pygmalion has been an extremely successful play all over europe and north america as well as at home
it is so intensely and deliberately didactic and its subject is esteemed so dry that i delight in throwing it at the heads of the wiseacres who repeat the parrot cry that art should never be didactic
finally and for the encouragement of people troubled with accents that cut them off from all high employment i may add that the change wrought by professor $mrs_higgins$ in the flower #girl# is neither impossible nor uncommon
the modern concierge #daughter# who fulfils her ambition by playing the queen of spain in ruy blas at the theatre francais is only one of many thousands of #man# and #woman# who have sloughed off their native dialects and acquired a new tongue
but the #thing# has to be done scientifically or the last state of the aspirant may be worse than the first
an honest and natural slum dialect is more tolerable than the attempt of a phonetically untaught person to imitate the vulgar dialect of the golf club and i am sorry to say that in spite of the efforts of our academy of dramatic art there is still too much sham golfing english on our stage and too little of the noble english of forbes robertson
it goes to prove my contention that art should never be anything else act i covent garden at m torrents of heavy summer rain
pedestrians running for shelter into the market and under the portico of st paul church where there are already several people among them a lady and her #daughter# in evening dress
they are all peering out gloomily at the rain except one #man# with his back turned to the rest who seems wholly preoccupied the church clock strikes the first quarter
cab whistles blowing frantically in all directions the #daughter# in the space between the central pillars close to the one on her left
i getting chilled to the bone what can $freddy$ be doing all this time he been gone twenty minutes the #mother# on her #daughter# #right#
not so long but he ought to have got us a cab by this a bystander on the lady #right# he wont get no cab not until half past
eleven missus when they come back after dropping their theatre fares the #mother# but we must have a cab we cant stand here until half past eleven
it too bad the bystander well it aint my fault missus the #daughter# if $freddy$ had a bit of gumption he would have got one at the theatre door
the #mother# what could he have done poor boy the #daughter# other people got cabs why couldnt he $freddy$ rushes in out of the rain from the southampton street side and comes between them closing a dripping umbrella
he is a young #man# of twenty in evening dress very wet around the ankles the #daughter# well havent you got a cab
$freddy$ there not one to be had for love or money the #mother# oh $freddy$ there must be one you cant have tried
the #daughter# it too tiresome do you expect us to go and get one ourselves $freddy$ i tell you they re all engaged
the rain was so sudden nobody was prepared and everybody had to take a cab i ve been to charing cross one #way# and nearly to ludgate circus the other and they were all engaged
the #mother# did you try trafalgar square $freddy$ there wasnt one at trafalgar square the #daughter# did you try $freddy$ i tried as far as charing cross station
did you expect me to walk to hammersmith the #daughter# you havent tried at all the #mother# you really are very helpless $freddy$
go again and dont come back until you have found a cab $freddy$ i shall simply get soaked for nothing the #daughter#
and what about us are we to stay here all night in this draught with next to nothing on you selfish pig $freddy$
he opens his umbrella and dashes off strandwards but comes into collision with a flower #girl# who is hurrying in for shelter knocking her basket out of her hands
oh very well i ll go i ll go a blinding flash of lightning followed instantly by a rattling peal of thunder orchestrates the incident the flower #girl#
nah then $freddy$ look wh gowin deah $freddy$ sorry he rushes off the flower #girl# picking up her scattered flowers and replacing them in the basket
there menners yer te oo banches voylets trod into the mad she sits down on the plinth of the column sorting her flowers on the lady #right#
she wears a little sailor hat of black straw that has long been exposed to the dust and soot of london and has seldom if ever been brushed
she is not at all an attractive person she is perhaps eighteen perhaps twenty hardly older her hair needs washing rather badly its mousy color can hardly be natural
she wears a shoddy black coat that reaches nearly to her knees and is shaped to her waist she has a brown skirt with a coarse apron
she is no doubt as clean as she can afford to be but compared to the ladies she is very dirty
her features are no worse than theirs but their condition leaves something to be desired and she needs the services of a dentist the #mother#
her boots are much the worse for wear how do you know that my son name is $freddy$ pray the flower #girl#
wal fewd dan de ooty bawmz a mather should eed now bettern to spawl a pore gel flahrzn than ran awy atbaht pyin
here with apologies this desperate attempt to represent her dialect without a #phonetic# alphabet must be abandoned as unintelligible outside london
ow eez ye ooa san is will ye oo py me them the #daughter# do nothing of the sort #mother# the idea

sixpence thrown away really mamma you might have spared $freddy$ that she retreats in disgust behind the pillar an elderly gentleman of the amiable military type rushes into shelter and closes a dripping umbrella
he is in the same plight as $freddy$ very wet about the ankles he is in evening dress with a light overcoat
he takes the place left vacant by the #daughter# retirement the gentleman phew the #mother# to the gentleman oh sir is there any sign of its stopping
he goes to the plinth beside the flower #girl# puts up his foot on it and stoops to turn down his trouser ends the #mother#
she retires sadly and joins her #daughter# the flower #girl# taking advantage of the military gentleman proximity to establish friendly relations with him if it worse
the gentleman i afraid not it started worse than ever about two minutes ago oh dear it a sign it nearly over
so cheer up captain and buy a flower off a poor #girl# the gentleman i sorry i havent any change the flower #girl#

all turn to the #man# who is taking notes the flower #girl# springing up terrified i aint done nothing wrong by speaking to the gentleman
hysterically i a respectable #girl# so help me i never spoke to him except to ask him to buy a flower off me
i ve a #right# to sell flowers if i keep off the kerb general hubbub mostly sympathetic to the flower #girl# but deprecating her excessive sensibility
cries of dont start hollerin who hurting you nobody going to touch you what the good of fussing steady on easy easy etc come from the elderly staid spectators who pat her comfortingly
a remoter group not knowing what the matter is crowd in and increase the noise with question and answer what the row
less patient ones bid her shut her head or ask her roughly what is wrong with her what she do where is he
a tec taking her down what him yes him over there took money off the gentleman etc the flower #girl# distraught and mobbed breaks through them to the gentleman crying mildly
oh sir dont let him charge me you dunno what it means to me they ll take away my #character# and drive me on the streets for speaking to gentlemen
they the note taker coming forward on her #right# the rest crowding after him there there there there who hurting you you silly #girl#
what do you take me for the bystander it all #right# he a gentleman look at his boots explaining to the note taker she thought you was a copper nark sir
the note taker with quick interest what a copper nark the bystander inept at definition it a well it a copper nark as you might say
what else would you call it a sort of informer the flower #girl# still hysterical i take my bible oath i never said a word the note taker overbearing but good humored
oh shut up shut up do i look like a policeman the flower #girl# far from reassured then what did you take down my words for
the note taker opens his book and holds it steadily under her nose though the pressure of the mob trying to read it over his shoulders would upset a weaker #man#
how do i know whether you took me down #right# you just show me what you ve wrote about me what that
that aint proper writing i cant read that the note taker i can reads reproducing her pronunciation exactly cheer ap keptin haw
ya flahr orf a pore gel the flower #girl# much distressed it because i called him captain i meant no harm

course they could what business is it of yours you mind your own affairs he wants promotion he does taking down people words
#girl# never said a word to him what harm if she did nice #thing# a #girl# cant shelter from the rain without being insulted etc etc etc
she is conducted by the more sympathetic demonstrators back to her plinth where she resumes her seat and struggles with her emotion the bystander
he aint a tec he a blooming busybody that what he is i tell you look at his boots the note taker turning on him genially
and how are all your people down at selsey the bystander suspiciously who told you my people come from selsey the note taker

the flower #girl# appalled oh what harm is there in my leaving lisson grove it wasnt fit for a pig to live in and i had to pay four and six a week
in tears oh boo hoo oo the note taker live where you like but stop that noise the gentleman to the #girl# come come
he cant touch you you have a #right# to live where you please a sarcastic bystander thrusting himself between the note taker and the gentleman
park lane for instance i like to go into the housing question with you i would the flower #girl# subsiding into a brooding melancholy over her basket and talking very low spiritedly to herself
i a good #girl# i am the sarcastic bystander not attending to her do you know where i come from the note taker promptly hoxton
titterings popular interest in the note taker performance increases the sarcastic one amazed well who said i didnt bly me you know everything you do
the flower #girl# still nursing her sense of injury aint no call to meddle with me he aint the bystander to her
to the note taker see here what call have you to know about people what never offered to meddle with you
of course he aint dont you stand it from him where your warrant several bystanders encouraged by this seeming point of law
yes where your warrant the flower #girl# let him say what he likes i dont want to have no truck with him
the bystander you take us for dirt under your feet dont you catch you taking liberties with a gentleman the sarcastic bystander

the note taker i ve thought of that perhaps i shall some day the rain has stopped and the persons on the outside of the crowd begin to drop off
the #daughter# out of patience pushing her #way# rudely to the front and displacing the gentleman who politely retires to the other side of the pillar
the flower #girl# resenting the reaction he no gentleman he aint to interfere with a poor #girl# what on earth is $freddy$ doing
i shall get pneumonia if i stay in this draught any longer the note taker to himself hastily making a note of her pronunciation of monia
earlscourt the #daughter# violently will you please keep your impertinent remarks to yourself the note taker did i say that out loud
i didnt mean to i beg your pardon your #mother# epsom unmistakeably the #mother# advancing between her #daughter# and the note taker how very curious

excuse me to the #daughter# you want a cab do you the #daughter# dont dare speak to me the #mother# oh please please $clara$
her #daughter# repudiates her with an angry shrug and retires haughtily we should be so grateful to you sir if you found us a cab
the note taker produces a whistle oh thank you she joins her #daughter# the note taker blows a piercing blast the sarcastic bystander
there i knowed he was a plain clothes copper the bystander that aint a police whistle that a sporting whistle the flower #girl# still preoccupied with her wounded feelings
he no #right# to take away my #character# my #character# is the same to me as any lady the note taker
i dont know whether you ve noticed it but the rain stopped about two minutes ago the bystander so it has why didnt you say so before

thenk you teacher haw haw so long he touches his hat with mock respect and strolls off the flower #girl# frightening people like that
how would he like it himself the #mother# it quite fine now $clara$ we can walk to a motor bus come
she gathers her skirts above her ankles and hurries off towards the strand the #daughter# but the cab her #mother# is out of hearing oh how tiresome
she follows angrily all the rest have gone except the note taker the gentleman and the flower #girl# who sits arranging her basket and still pitying herself in murmurs
the gentleman returning to his former place on the note taker left how do you do it if i may ask
the flower #girl# poor #girl# hard enough for her to live without being worrited and chivied the note taker simply #phonetic#
the science of speech that my profession also my hobby happy is the #man# who can make a living by his hobby
you can spot an irishman or a yorkshireman by his brogue i can place any #man# within six miles i can place him within two miles in london
sometimes within two streets the flower #girl# ought to be ashamed of himself unmanly coward the gentleman but is there a living in that
the note taker oh yes quite a fat one this is an age of upstarts #man# begin in kentish town with pounds a year and end in park lane with a hundred thousand
they want to drop kentish town but they give themselves away every time they open their mouths now i can teach them the flower #girl#
let him mind his own business and leave a poor #girl# the note taker explosively #woman# cease this detestable boohooing instantly or else seek the shelter of some other place of worship
the flower #girl# with feeble defiance i ve a #right# to be here if i like same as you the note taker
remember that you are a human being with a soul and the divine gift of articulate speech that your native language is the language of shakespear and milton and the bible and dont sit there crooning like a bilious pigeon
the flower #girl# quite overwhelmed and looking up at him in mingled wonder and deprecation without daring to raise her head
a #woman# who utters such depressing and disgusting sounds has no #right# to be anywhere no #right# to live ah ah ah ow ow oo the note taker whipping out his book heavens
what a sound he writes then holds out the book and reads reproducing her vowels exactly ah ah ah ow ow ow oo the flower #girl# tickled by the performance and laughing in spite of herself
you see this creature with her kerbstone english the english that will keep her in the gutter to the end of her days
garn the note taker well sir in three months i could pass that #girl# off as a duchess at an ambassador garden party
i could even get her a place as lady maid or shop assistant which requires better english that the sort of #thing# i do for commercial millionaires
and on the profits of it i do genuine scientific work in #phonetic# and a little as a poet on miltonic lines
the gentleman i am myself a student of indian dialects and the note taker eagerly are you do you know colonel $pickering$ the author of spoken sanscrit
the gentleman i am colonel $pickering$ who are you the note taker $henry_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ author of $mrs_higgins$ universal alphabet $pickering$ with enthusiasm

the flower #girl# rising in desperation you ought to be stuffed with nails you ought flinging the basket at his feet take the whole blooming basket for sixpence
the church clock strikes the second quarter $mrs_higgins$ hearing in it the voice of god rebuking him for his pharisaic want of charity to the poor #girl#
he raises his hat solemnly then throws a handful of money into the basket and follows $pickering$ the flower #girl# picking up a half crown
a reminder ah ow ooh picking up a couple of florins aaah ow ooh picking up several coins aaaaaah ow ooh picking up a half sovereign aasaaaaaaaaah ow ooh
$freddy$ springing out of a taxicab got one at last hallo to the #girl# where are the two ladies that were here
the flower #girl# they walked to the bus when the rain stopped $freddy$ and left me with a cab on my hands
damnation the flower #girl# with grandeur never you mind young #man# i going home in a taxi she sails off to the cab
the driver puts his hand behind him and holds the door firmly shut against her quite understanding his mistrust she shows him her handful of money eightpence aint no object to me charlie
he grins and opens the door angel court drury lane round the corner of micklejohn oil shop let see how fast you can make her hop it
she gets in and pulls the door to with a slam as the taxicab starts $freddy$ well i dashed act ii
next day at a $mrs_higgins$ laboratory in wimpole street it is a room on the first floor looking on the street and was meant for the drawing room
the double doors are in the middle of the back hall and persons entering find in the corner to their #right# two tall file cabinets at #right# angles to one another against the walls
in this corner stands a flat writing table on which are a phonograph a laryngoscope a row of tiny organ pipes with a bellows a set of lamp chimneys for singing flames with burners attached to a gas plug in the wall by an indiarubber tube several tuning forks of different sizes a life size image of half a human head showing in section the vocal organs and a box containing a supply of wax cylinders for the phonograph
further down the room on the same side is a fireplace with a comfortable leather covered easy chair at the side of the hearth nearest the door and a coal scuttle
there is a clock on the mantelpiece between the fireplace and the phonograph table is a stand for newspapers on the other side of the central door to the left of the visitor is a cabinet of shallow drawers
the corner beyond and most of the side wall is occupied by a grand piano with the keyboard at the end furthest from the door and a bench for the player extending the full length of the keyboard
on it is a telephone and the telephone directory on the piano is a dessert dish heaped with fruit and sweets mostly chocolates
the middle of the room is clear besides the easy chair the piano bench and two chairs at the phonograph table there is one stray chair
it stands near the fireplace on the walls engravings mostly piranesis and mezzotint portraits no paintings $pickering$ is seated at the table putting down some cards and a tuning fork which he has been using
he appears in the morning light as a robust vital appetizing sort of #man# of forty or thereabouts dressed in a professional looking black frock coat with a white linen collar and black silk tie
he is of the energetic scientific type heartily even violently interested in everything that can be studied as a scientific subject and careless about himself and other people including their feelings
he is in fact but for his years and size rather like a very impetuous baby taking notice eagerly and loudly and requiring almost as much watching to keep him out of unintended mischief
his #manner# varies from genial bullying when he is in a good humor to stormy petulance when anything goes wrong but he is so entirely frank and void of malice that he remains likeable even in his least reasonable moments
$mrs_higgins$ is standing up near him closing two or three file drawers which are hanging out $mrs_higgins$ as he shuts the last drawer
well i think that the whole show $pickering$ it really amazing i havent taken half of it in you know $mrs_higgins$
would you like to go over any of it again $pickering$ rising and coming to the fireplace where he plants himself with his back to the fire
no thank you not now i quite done up for this morning $mrs_higgins$ following him and standing beside him on his left
tired of listening to sounds $pickering$ yes it a fearful strain i rather fancied myself because i can pronounce twenty four distinct vowel sounds but your hundred and thirty beat me
i cant hear a bit of difference between most of them $mrs_higgins$ chuckling and going over to the piano to eat sweets
you hear no difference at first but you keep on listening and presently you find they re all as different as a from
oh that comes with practice $mrs_pearce$ looks in she is $mrs_higgins$ housekeeper what the matter $mrs_pearce$ hesitating evidently perplexed a young #woman# wants to see you sir
$mrs_higgins$ a young #woman# what does she want $mrs_pearce$ well sir she says you ll be glad to see her when you know what she come about
she quite a common #girl# sir very common indeed i should have sent her away only i thought perhaps you wanted her to talk into your machines
i hope i ve not done wrong but really you see such queer people sometimes you ll excuse me i sure sir $mrs_higgins$
oh that all #right# $mrs_pearce$ has she an interesting accent $mrs_pearce$ oh something dreadful sir really i dont know how you can take an interest in it
show her up $mrs_pearce$ he rushes across to his working table and picks out a cylinder to use on the phonograph mrs
$mrs_higgins$ to $pickering$ let have her up $mrs_pearce$ only half resigned to it very well sir it for you to say
we ll set her talking and i ll take it down first in bell visible speech then in broad romic and then we ll get her on the phonograph so that you can turn her on as often as you like with the written transcript before you
she goes downstairs $mrs_higgins$ this is rather a bit of luck i ll show you how i make records $mrs_pearce$ returning
this is the young #woman# sir the flower #girl# enters in state she has a hat with three ostrich feathers orange sky blue and red
the pathos of this deplorable figure with its innocent vanity and consequential air touches $pickering$ who has already straightened himself in the presence of $mrs_pearce$
but as to $mrs_higgins$ the only distinction he makes between #man# and #woman# is that when he is neither bullying nor exclaiming to the heavens against some featherweight cross he coaxes #woman# as a child coaxes its nurse when it wants to get anything out of her
she has a nearly clean apron and the shoddy coat has been tidied a little $mrs_higgins$ brusquely recognizing her with unconcealed disappointment and at once baby like making an intolerable grievance of it
she no use i ve got all the records i want of the lisson grove lingo and i not going to waste another cylinder on it
why this is the #girl# i jotted down last night to the #girl# be off with you i dont want you
to $mrs_pearce$ who is waiting at the door for further instruction did you tell him i come in a taxi
the flower #girl# dont you be so saucy you aint heard what i come for yet $mrs_pearce$ nonsense #girl# what do you think a gentleman like mr $mrs_higgins$ cares what you came in
well i aint come here to ask for any compliment and if my money not good enough i can go elsewhere
the flower #girl# oh we are proud he aint above giving lessons not him i heard him say so $mrs_higgins$
good enough for what the flower #girl# good enough for ye oo now you know dont you i come to have lessons i am
and to pay for em too make no mistake $mrs_higgins$ stupent well recovering his breath with a gasp what do you expect me to say to you
the flower #girl# well if you was a gentleman you might ask me to sit down i think dont i tell you i bringing you business
$mrs_higgins$ $pickering$ shall we ask this baggage to sit down or shall we throw her out of the window the flower #girl# running away in terror to the piano where she turns at bay
ah ah ah ow ow ow oo wounded and whimpering i wont be called a baggage when i ve offered to pay like any lady motionless the two #man# stare at her from the other side of the room amazed
$pickering$ gently what is it you want my #girl# the flower #girl# i want to be a lady in a flower shop stead of selling at the corner of tottenham court road
but they wont take me unless i can talk more genteel he said he could teach me well here i am ready to pay him not asking any favor and he treats me as if i was dirt
$mrs_pearce$ how can you be such a foolish ignorant #girl# as to think you could afford to pay mr $mrs_higgins$
the flower #girl# why shouldnt i i know what lessons cost as well as you do and i ready to pay
i thought you come off it when you saw a chance of getting back a bit of what you chucked at me last night
$mrs_higgins$ how much the flower #girl# coming back to him triumphant now you re talking confidentially you had a drop in hadnt you
$mrs_higgins$ peremptorily sit down the flower #girl# oh if you re going to make a compliment of it $mrs_higgins$ thundering at her
she places the stray chair near the hearthrug between $mrs_higgins$ and $pickering$ and stands behind it waiting for the #girl# to sit down
sit down $mrs_pearce$ severely sit down #girl# do as you re told the flower #girl# ah ah ah ow ow oo she stands half rebellious half bewildered $pickering$ very courteous
wont you sit down $liza$ coyly dont mind if i do she sits down $pickering$ returns to the hearthrug $mrs_higgins$ what your name

they found a nest with four eggs in it $mrs_higgins$ they took one apiece and left three in it they laugh heartily at their own wit
$liza$ oh dont be silly $mrs_pearce$ you mustnt speak to the gentleman like that $liza$ well why wont he speak sensible to me
$mrs_higgins$ come back to business how much do you propose to pay me for the lessons $liza$ oh i know what #right#
well you wouldnt have the face to ask me the same for teaching me my own language as you would for french so i wont give more than a shilling
a lady friend of mine gets french lessons for eighteenpence an hour from a real french gentleman take it or leave it
you know $pickering$ if you consider a shilling not as a simple shilling but as a percentage of this #girl# income it works out as fully equivalent to sixty or seventy guineas from a millionaire
$mrs_higgins$ walking up and down the room rattling his keys and his cash in his pockets $pickering$ how so $mrs_higgins$ figure it out
a millionaire has about pounds a day she earns about half a crown $liza$ haughtily who told you i only $mrs_higgins$ continuing
she offers me two fifths of her day income for a lesson two fifths of a millionaire income for a day would be somewhere about pounds
it handsome by $george$ it enormous it the biggest offer i ever had $liza$ rising terrified sixty pounds what are you talking about
i never offered you sixty pounds where would i get $mrs_higgins$ hold your tongue $liza$ weeping but i aint got sixty pounds
oh $mrs_pearce$ dont cry you silly #girl# sit down nobody is going to touch your money $mrs_higgins$ somebody is going to touch you with a broomstick if you dont stop snivelling
sit down $liza$ obeying slowly ah ah ah ow oo one would think you was my father $mrs_higgins$ if i decide to teach you i ll be worse than two fathers to you
here he offers her his silk handkerchief $liza$ what this for $mrs_higgins$ to wipe your eyes to wipe any part of your face that feels moist
remember that your handkerchief and that your sleeve dont mistake the one for the other if you wish to become a lady in a shop
$liza$ utterly bewildered stares helplessly at him $mrs_pearce$ it no use talking to her like that mr $mrs_higgins$ she doesnt understand you
besides you re quite wrong she doesnt do it that #way# at all she takes the handkerchief $liza$ snatching it here you give me that handkerchief
he give it to me not to you $pickering$ laughing he did i think it must be regarded as her property $mrs_pearce$
$mrs_pearce$ resigning herself serve you #right# mr $mrs_higgins$ $pickering$ $mrs_higgins$ i interested what about the ambassador garden party i ll say you re the greatest teacher alive if you make that good
i ll bet you all the expenses of the experiment you cant do it and i ll pay for the lessons $liza$ oh you are real good
thank you captain $mrs_higgins$ tempted looking at her it almost irresistible she so deliciously low so horribly dirty $liza$ protesting extremely ah ah ah ah ow ow oooo
i aint dirty i washed my face and hands afore i come i did $pickering$ you re certainly not going to turn her head with flattery $mrs_higgins$
oh dont say that sir there more #way# than one of turning a #girl# head and nobody can do it better than mr $mrs_higgins$ though he may not always mean it
$mrs_pearce$ uneasy i do hope sir you wont encourage him to do anything foolish $mrs_higgins$ becoming excited as the idea grows on him what is life but a series of inspired follies
the difficulty is to find them to do never lose a chance it doesnt come every day i shall make a duchess of this draggletailed guttersnipe
yes in six months in three if she has a good ear and a quick tongue i ll take her anywhere and pass her off as anything
$liza$ strongly deprecating this view of her ah ah ah ow ow oo $mrs_higgins$ carried away we ll start today now this moment take her away and clean her $mrs_pearce$
monkey brand if it wont come off any other #way# is there a good fire in the kitchen $mrs_pearce$ protesting yes
but $mrs_higgins$ storming on take all her clothes off and burn them ring up whiteley or somebody for new ones wrap her up in brown paper till they come
$liza$ you re no gentleman you re not to talk of such #thing# i a good #girl# i am and i know what the like of you are i do
$mrs_higgins$ we want none of your lisson grove prudery here young #woman# you ve got to learn to behave like a duchess
take her away $mrs_pearce$ if she gives you any trouble wallop her $liza$ springing up and running between $pickering$ and $mrs_pearce$ for protection
no i ll call the police i will $mrs_pearce$ but i ve no place to put her $mrs_higgins$ put her in the dustbin
$liza$ ah ah ah ow ow oo $pickering$ oh come $mrs_higgins$ be reasonable $mrs_pearce$ resolutely you must be reasonable mr $mrs_higgins$ really you must
you cant walk over everybody like this $mrs_higgins$ thus scolded subsides the hurricane is succeeded by a zephyr of amiable surprise
$mrs_higgins$ with professional exquisiteness of modulation i walk over everybody my dear $mrs_pearce$ my dear $pickering$ i never had the slightest intention of walking over anyone
all i propose is that we should be kind to this poor #girl# we must help her to prepare and fit herself for her new station in life
if i did not express myself clearly it was because i did not wish to hurt her delicacy or yours $liza$ reassured steals back to her chair
$mrs_pearce$ to $pickering$ well did you ever hear anything like that sir $pickering$ laughing heartily never $mrs_pearce$ never $mrs_higgins$ patiently
well the matter is sir that you cant take a #girl# up like that as if you were picking up a pebble on the beach
what the matter $mrs_pearce$ $mrs_higgins$ why not $mrs_pearce$ why not but you dont know anything about her what about her parents
dont you know that a #woman# of that class looks a worn out drudge of fifty a year after she married
she may be married $liza$ garn $mrs_higgins$ there as the #girl# very properly says garn married indeed $liza$ who marry me
by $george$ $eliza_doolittle$ the streets will be strewn with the bodies of #man# shooting themselves for your sake before i ve done with you
$mrs_higgins$ suddenly resorting to the most thrillingly beautiful low tones in his best elocutionary style $mrs_pearce$ nonsense sir you mustnt talk like that to her
$liza$ rising and squaring herself determinedly i going away he off his chump he is i dont want no balmies teaching me
$mrs_higgins$ wounded in his tenderest point by her insensibility to his elocution oh indeed i mad am i very well $mrs_pearce$ you neednt order the new clothes for her
throw her out $liza$ whimpering nah ow you got no #right# to touch me $mrs_pearce$ you see now what comes of being saucy
indicating the door this #way# please $liza$ almost in tears i didnt want no clothes i wouldnt have taken them she throws away the handkerchief
i can buy my own clothes $mrs_higgins$ deftly retrieving the handkerchief and intercepting her on her reluctant #way# to the door
this is my return for offering to take you out of the gutter and dress you beautifully and make a lady of you
you re an ungrateful wicked #girl# $mrs_pearce$ stop mr $mrs_higgins$ i wont allow it it you that are wicked go home to your parents #girl# and tell them to take better care of you
$liza$ i aint got no parents they told me i was big enough to earn my own living and turned me out
$mrs_pearce$ where your #mother# $liza$ i aint got no #mother# her that turned me out was my sixth stepmother but i done without them
and i a good #girl# i am $mrs_higgins$ very well then what on earth is all this fuss about the #girl# doesnt belong to anybody is no use to anybody but me
he goes to $mrs_pearce$ and begins coaxing you can adopt her $mrs_pearce$ i sure a #daughter# would be a great amusement to you
now dont make any more fuss take her downstairs and $mrs_pearce$ but what to become of her is she to be paid anything
do be sensible sir $mrs_higgins$ oh pay her whatever is necessary put it down in the housekeeping book impatiently what on earth will she want with money
she ll have her food and her clothes she ll only drink if you give her money $liza$ turning on him oh you are a brute
it a lie nobody ever saw the sign of liquor on me she goes back to her chair and plants herself there defiantly $pickering$ in good humored remonstrance
does it occur to you $mrs_higgins$ that the #girl# has some feelings $mrs_higgins$ looking critically at her oh no i dont think so
not any feelings that we need bother about cheerily have you $eliza_doolittle$ $liza$ i got my feelings same as anyone else
$mrs_higgins$ to $pickering$ reflectively you see the difficulty $pickering$ eh what difficulty $mrs_higgins$ to get her to talk grammar the mere pronunciation is easy enough
$liza$ i dont want to talk grammar i want to talk like a lady $mrs_pearce$ will you please keep to the point mr $mrs_higgins$
i want to know on what terms the #girl# is to be here is she to have any wages and what is to become of her when you ve finished your teaching
you must look ahead a little $mrs_higgins$ impatiently what to become of her if i leave her in the gutter tell me that $mrs_pearce$
well when i ve done with her we can throw her back into the gutter and then it will be her own business again so
$mrs_pearce$ that her own business not yours mr $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ that all #right# $liza$ oh you ve no feeling heart in you you dont care for nothing but yourself
she rises and takes the floor resolutely here i ve had enough of this i going making for the door you ought to be ashamed of yourself you ought
$mrs_higgins$ snatching a chocolate cream from the piano his eyes suddenly beginning to twinkle with mischief have some chocolates $eliza_doolittle$ $liza$ halting tempted
$mrs_higgins$ whips out his penknife cuts a chocolate in two puts one half into his mouth and bolts it and offers her the other half
how do i know what might be in them i ve heard of #girl# being drugged by the like of you $mrs_higgins$
$liza$ opens her mouth to retort he pops the half chocolate into it you shall have boxes of them barrels of them every day
pledge of good faith $eliza_doolittle$ i eat one half you eat the other you shall live on them eh $liza$ who has disposed of the chocolate after being nearly choked by it
i wouldnt have ate it only i too ladylike to take it out of my mouth $mrs_higgins$ listen $eliza_doolittle$ i think you said you came in a taxi
$liza$ well what if i did i ve as good a #right# to take a taxi as anyone else $mrs_higgins$ you have $eliza_doolittle$ and in future you shall have as many taxis as you want
you shall go up and down and round the town in a taxi every day think of that $eliza_doolittle$ $mrs_pearce$
mr $mrs_higgins$ you re tempting the #girl# it not #right# she should think of the future $mrs_higgins$ at her age nonsense time enough to think of the future when you havent any future to think of
no $eliza_doolittle$ do as this lady does think of other people futures but never think of your own think of chocolates and taxis and gold and diamonds
$liza$ no i dont want no gold and no diamonds i a good #girl# i am she sits down again with an attempt at dignity $mrs_higgins$
and you shall marry an officer in the guards with a beautiful moustache the son of a marquis who will disinherit him for marrying you but will relent when he sees your beauty and goodness $pickering$
you shall remain so $eliza_doolittle$ under the care of $mrs_pearce$ excuse me $mrs_higgins$ but i really must interfere $mrs_pearce$ is quite #right#
if this #girl# is to put herself in your hands for six months for an experiment in teaching she must understand thoroughly what she doing
$mrs_higgins$ how can she she incapable of understanding anything besides do any of us understand what we are doing if we did would we ever do it
$pickering$ very clever $mrs_higgins$ but not sound sense to $eliza_doolittle$ miss $eliza_doolittle$ $liza$ overwhelmed ah ah ow oo $mrs_higgins$ there that all you get out of $eliza_doolittle$
ah ah ow oo no use explaining as a military #man# you ought to know that give her her orders that what she wants

if you re good and do whatever you re told you shall sleep in a proper bedroom and have lots to eat and money to buy chocolates and take rides in taxis
if you re naughty and idle you will sleep in the back kitchen among the black beetles and be walloped by $mrs_pearce$ with a broomstick
if the king finds out you re not a lady you will be taken by the police to the tower of london where your head will be cut off as a warning to other presumptuous flower #girl#
if you are not found out you shall have a present of seven and sixpence to start life with as a lady in a shop
if you refuse this offer you will be a most ungrateful and wicked #girl# and the angels will weep for you
at the end of six months you shall go to buckingham palace in a carriage beautifully dressed to $pickering$ now are you satisfied $pickering$
to $mrs_pearce$ can i put it more plainly and fairly $mrs_pearce$ $mrs_pearce$ patiently i think you better let me speak to the #girl# properly in private
of course i know you dont mean her any harm but when you get what you call interested in people accents you never think or care what may happen to them or you
i dont know that i can take charge of her or consent to the arrangement at all come with me $eliza_doolittle$
$mrs_higgins$ that all #right# thank you $mrs_pearce$ bundle her off to the bath room $liza$ rising reluctantly and suspiciously you re a great bully you are
i wont stay here if i dont like i wont let nobody wallop me i never asked to go to bucknam palace i didnt
i was never in trouble with the police not me i a good #girl# $mrs_pearce$ dont answer back #girl# you dont understand the gentleman
come with me she leads the #way# to the door and holds it open for $eliza_doolittle$ $liza$ as she goes out
well what i say is #right# i wont go near the king not if i going to have my head cut off
i always been a good #girl# and i never offered to say a word to him and i dont owe him nothing and i dont care and i wont be put upon and i have my feelings the same as anyone else $mrs_pearce$ shuts the door and $eliza_doolittle$ plaints are no longer audible
if i known what i was letting myself in for i wouldnt have come here $pickering$ comes from the hearth to the chair and sits astride it with his arms on the back
$pickering$ excuse the straight question $mrs_higgins$ are you a #man# of good #character# where #woman# are concerned $mrs_higgins$ moodily have you ever met a #man# of good #character# where #woman# are concerned
$pickering$ yes very frequently $mrs_higgins$ dogmatically lifting himself on his hands to the level of the piano and sitting on it with a bounce
i find that the moment i let a #woman# make friends with me she becomes jealous exacting suspicious and a damned nuisance
well i havent i find that the moment i let myself make friends with a #woman# i become selfish and tyrannical
#woman# upset everything when you let them into your life you find that the #woman# is driving at one #thing# and you re driving at another
i suppose the #woman# wants to live her own life and the #man# wants to live his and each tries to drag the other on to the wrong track
one wants to go north and the other south and the result is that both have to go east though they both hate the east wind
$pickering$ at what for example $mrs_higgins$ coming off the piano restlessly oh lord knows he sits down on the bench at the keyboard
so here i am a confirmed old bachelor and likely to remain so $pickering$ rising and standing over him gravely come $mrs_higgins$
you know what i mean if i to be in this business i shall feel responsible for that #girl# i hope it understood that no advantage is to be taken of her position
$mrs_higgins$ what that #thing# sacred i assure you rising to explain you see she ll be a pupil and teaching would be impossible unless pupils were sacred
i ve taught scores of american millionairesses how to speak english the best looking #woman# in the world i seasoned they might as well be blocks of wood
i might as well be a block of wood it $mrs_pearce$ opens the door she has $eliza_doolittle$ hat in her hand
$pickering$ retires to the easy chair at the hearth and sits down $mrs_higgins$ eagerly well $mrs_pearce$ is it all #right# mrs
$mrs_pearce$ at the door i just wish to trouble you with a word if i may mr $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ yes certainly
come in she comes forward dont burn that $mrs_pearce$ i ll keep it as a curiosity he takes the hat mrs
i had to promise her not to burn it but i had better put it in the oven for a while
$mrs_pearce$ handle it carefully sir please $mrs_higgins$ putting it down hastily on the piano oh thank you well what have you to say to me
$pickering$ am i in the #way# $mrs_pearce$ not at all sir mr $mrs_higgins$ will you please be very particular what you say before the #girl#
$mrs_higgins$ sternly of course i always particular about what i say why do you say this to me $mrs_pearce$ unmoved
no sir you re not at all particular when you ve mislaid anything or when you get a little impatient now it doesnt matter before me i used to it
but you really must not swear before the #girl# $mrs_higgins$ indignantly i swear most emphatically i never swear i detest the habit
what the #devil# do you mean $mrs_pearce$ stolidly that what i mean sir you swear a great deal too much
i dont mind your damning and blasting and what the #devil# and where the #devil# and who the #devil# $mrs_higgins$ really
$mrs_pearce$ this language from your lips $mrs_pearce$ not to be put off but there is a certain word i must ask you not to use
the #girl# has just used it herself because the bath was too hot it begins with the same letter as bath
she knows no better she learnt it at her #mother# knee but she must not hear it from your lips $mrs_higgins$
loftily i cannot charge myself with having ever uttered it $mrs_pearce$ she looks at him steadfastly he adds hiding an uneasy conscience with a judicial air
except perhaps in a moment of extreme and justifiable excitement $mrs_pearce$ only this morning sir you applied it to your boots to the butter and to the brown bread
$mrs_higgins$ oh that mere alliteration $mrs_pearce$ natural to a poet $mrs_pearce$ well sir whatever you choose to call it i beg you not to let the #girl# hear you repeat it
$mrs_higgins$ oh very well very well is that all $mrs_pearce$ no sir we shall have to be very particular with this #girl# as to personal cleanliness
$mrs_higgins$ certainly quite #right# most important $mrs_pearce$ i mean not to be slovenly about her dress or untidy in leaving #thing# about
$mrs_higgins$ going to her solemnly just so i intended to call your attention to that he passes on to $pickering$ who is enjoying the conversation
take care of the pence and the pounds will take care of themselves is as true of personal habits as of money
immensely it is these little #thing# that matter $pickering$ he comes to anchor on the hearthrug with the air of a #man# in an unassailable position mrs
then might i ask you not to come down to breakfast in your dressing gown or at any rate not to use it as a napkin to the extent you do sir
and if you would be so good as not to eat everything off the same plate and to remember not to put the porridge saucepan out of your hand on the clean tablecloth it would be a better example to the #girl#
$mrs_higgins$ routed from the hearthrug and drifting back to the piano i may do these #thing# sometimes in absence of mind but surely i dont do them habitually
$mrs_pearce$ yes sir you know you nearly choked yourself with a fishbone in the jam only last week angrily by the #way# my dressing gown smells most damnably of benzine
$mrs_pearce$ no doubt it does mr $mrs_higgins$ but if you will wipe your fingers $mrs_higgins$ yelling oh very well very well i ll wipe them in my hair in future
$mrs_pearce$ i hope you re not offended mr $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ shocked at finding himself thought capable of an unamiable sentiment not at all not at all
you re quite #right# $mrs_pearce$ i shall be particularly careful before the #girl# is that all $mrs_pearce$ no sir might she use some of those japanese dresses you brought from abroad
i really cant put her back into her old #thing# $mrs_higgins$ certainly anything you like is that all $mrs_pearce$ thank you sir
that all she goes out $mrs_higgins$ you know $pickering$ that #woman# has the most extraordinary ideas about me here i am a shy diffident sort of #man#
i ve never been able to feel really grown up and tremendous like other chaps and yet she firmly persuaded that i an arbitrary overbearing bossing kind of person
i cant account for it $mrs_pearce$ returns $mrs_pearce$ if you please sir the trouble beginning already there a dustman downstairs alfred $eliza_doolittle$ wants to see you
he says you have his #daughter# here $pickering$ rising phew i say he retreats to the hearthrug $mrs_higgins$ promptly send the blackguard up
$mrs_pearce$ oh very well sir she goes out $pickering$ he may not be a blackguard $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ nonsense of course he a blackguard
$pickering$ whether he is or not i afraid we shall have some trouble with him $mrs_higgins$ confidently oh no i think not
if there any trouble he shall have it with me not i with him and we are sure to get something interesting out of him
she admits $eliza_doolittle$ and retires alfred $eliza_doolittle$ is an elderly but vigorous dustman clad in the costume of his profession including a hat with a back brim covering his neck and shoulders
$pickering$ about the #girl# $mrs_higgins$ no i mean his dialect $pickering$ oh $mrs_pearce$ at the door $eliza_doolittle$ sir he has well marked and rather interesting features and seems equally free from fear and conscience
he has a remarkably expressive voice the result of a habit of giving vent to his feelings without reserve his present pose is that of wounded honor and stern resolution
$eliza_doolittle$ at the door uncertain which of the two gentlemen is his #man# professor $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ here good morning sit down
$eliza_doolittle$ morning governor he sits down magisterially i come about a very serious matter governor $mrs_higgins$ to $pickering$ brought up in hounslow
#mother# welsh i should think $eliza_doolittle$ opens his mouth amazed $mrs_higgins$ continues what do you want $eliza_doolittle$ $eliza_doolittle$ menacingly i want my #daughter# that what i want
see $mrs_higgins$ of course you do you re her father arent you you dont suppose anyone else wants her do you i glad to see you have some spark of family feeling left
she upstairs take her away at once $eliza_doolittle$ rising fearfully taken aback what $mrs_higgins$ take her away do you suppose i going to keep your #daughter# for you
$eliza_doolittle$ remonstrating now now look here governor is this reasonable is it fair to take advantage of a #man# like this
your #daughter# had the audacity to come to my house and ask me to teach her how to speak properly so that she could get a place in a flower shop
the #girl# belongs to me you got her where do i come in he sits down again $mrs_higgins$ this gentleman and my housekeeper have been here all the time
bullying him how dare you come here and attempt to blackmail me you sent her here on purpose $eliza_doolittle$ protesting no governor
$mrs_higgins$ you must have how else could you possibly know that she is here $eliza_doolittle$ dont take a #man# up like that governor
$mrs_higgins$ the police shall take you up this is a plant a plot to extort money by threats i shall telephone for the police he goes resolutely to the telephone and opens the directory $eliza_doolittle$
have i asked you for a brass farthing i leave it to the gentleman here have i said a word about money
$mrs_higgins$ throwing the book aside and marching down on $eliza_doolittle$ with a poser what else did you come for $eliza_doolittle$ sweetly
well what would a #man# come for be human governor $mrs_higgins$ disarmed alfred did you put her up to it $eliza_doolittle$
so help me governor i never did i take my bible oath i aint seen the #girl# these two months past
$mrs_higgins$ then how did you know she was here $eliza_doolittle$ most musical most melancholy i ll tell you governor if you ll only let me get a word in
i willing to tell you i wanting to tell you i waiting to tell you $mrs_higgins$ $pickering$ this chap has a certain natural gift of rhetoric
observe the rhythm of his native woodnotes wild i willing to tell you i wanting to tell you i waiting to tell you
sentimental rhetoric that the welsh strain in him it also accounts for his mendacity and dishonesty $pickering$ oh please $mrs_higgins$
i west country myself to $eliza_doolittle$ how did you know the #girl# was here if you didnt send her $eliza_doolittle$ it was like this governor
the #girl# took a boy in the taxi to give him a jaunt son of her landlady he is he hung about on the chance of her giving him another ride home
well she sent him back for her luggage when she heard you was willing for her to stop here i met the boy at the corner of long acre and endell street
$mrs_higgins$ public house yes $eliza_doolittle$ the poor #man# club governor why shouldnt i $pickering$ do let him tell his story $mrs_higgins$
$eliza_doolittle$ he told me what was up and i ask you what was my feelings and my duty as a father
i says to the boy you bring me the luggage i says $pickering$ why didnt you go for it yourself $eliza_doolittle$
landlady wouldnt have trusted me with it governor she that kind of #woman# you know i had to give the boy a penny afore
he trusted me with it the little swine i brought it to her just to oblige you like and make myself agreeable
that all $mrs_higgins$ how much luggage $eliza_doolittle$ musical instrument governor a few pictures a trifle of jewelry and a bird cage she said she didnt want no clothes
what was i to think from that governor i ask you as a parent what was i to think $mrs_higgins$ so you came to rescue her from worse than death eh
$eliza_doolittle$ appreciatively relieved at being understood just so governor that #right# $pickering$ but why did you bring her luggage if you intended to take her away
$eliza_doolittle$ have i said a word about taking her away have i now $mrs_higgins$ determinedly you re going to take her away double quick
he crosses to the hearth and rings the bell $eliza_doolittle$ rising no governor dont say that i not the #man# to stand in my #girl# light
here a career opening for her as you might say and $mrs_pearce$ opens the door and awaits orders $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_pearce$ this is $eliza_doolittle$ father
he has come to take her away give her to him he goes back to the piano with an air of washing his hands of the whole affair $eliza_doolittle$
no this is a misunderstanding listen here $mrs_pearce$ he cant take her away mr $mrs_higgins$ how can he you told me to burn her clothes
$eliza_doolittle$ that #right# i cant carry the #girl# through the streets like a blooming monkey can i i put it to you
$mrs_higgins$ you have put it to me that you want your #daughter# take your #daughter# if she has no clothes go out and buy her some
$eliza_doolittle$ desperate where the clothes she come in did i burn them or did your missus here $mrs_pearce$ i am the housekeeper if you please
i have sent for some clothes for your #girl# when they come you can take her away you can wait in the kitchen
this #way# please $eliza_doolittle$ much troubled accompanies her to the door then hesitates finally turns confidentially to $mrs_higgins$ $eliza_doolittle$ listen here governor
you and me is #man# of the world aint we $mrs_higgins$ oh #man# of the world are we you better go $mrs_pearce$
$mrs_pearce$ i think so indeed sir she goes with dignity $pickering$ the floor is yours mr $eliza_doolittle$ $eliza_doolittle$ to $pickering$
to $mrs_higgins$ who takes refuge on the piano bench a little overwhelmed by the proximity of his visitor for $eliza_doolittle$ has a professional flavor of dust about him
well the truth is i ve taken a sort of fancy to you governor and if you want the #girl# i not so set on having her back home again
i thank you governor but what i might be open to an arrangement regarded in the light of a young #woman# she a fine handsome #girl#
all i ask is my #right# as a father and you re the last #man# alive to expect me to let her go for nothing
as a #daughter# she not worth her keep and so i tell you straight for i can see you re one of the straight sort governor
well what a five pound note to you and what $eliza_doolittle$ to me he returns to his chair and sits down judicially $pickering$
i think you ought to know $eliza_doolittle$ that mr $mrs_higgins$ intentions are entirely honorable $eliza_doolittle$ course they are governor if i thought they wasnt i ask fifty
$mrs_higgins$ revolted do you mean to say you callous rascal that you would sell your #daughter# for pounds $eliza_doolittle$ not in a general #way# i wouldnt but to oblige a gentleman like you
i do a good deal i do assure you $pickering$ have you no morals #man# $eliza_doolittle$ unabashed cant afford them governor
neither could you if you was as poor as me not that i mean any harm you know but if $liza$ is going to have a bit out of this why not me too
there can be no question that as a matter of morals it a positive crime to give this chap a farthing
$mrs_higgins$ troubled i dont know what to do $pickering$ and yet i feel a sort of rough justice in his claim
$eliza_doolittle$ that it governor that all i say a father heart as it were $pickering$ well i know the feeling but really it seems hardly #right# $eliza_doolittle$
dont say that governor dont look at it that #way# what am i governors both i ask you what am i
i one of the undeserving poor that what i am think of what that means to a #man# it means that he up agen middle class morality all the time
if there anything going and i put in for a bit of it it always the same story you re undeserving so you cant have it
but my needs is as great as the most deserving widow that ever got money out of six different charities in one week for the death of the same husband
i dont need less than a deserving #man# i need more i dont eat less hearty than him and i drink a lot more
i want a bit of amusement cause i a thinking #man# i want cheerfulness and a song and a band when i feel low
well they charge me just the same for everything as they charge the deserving what is middle class morality just an excuse for never giving me anything
therefore i ask you as two gentlemen not to play that game on me i playing straight with you i aint pretending to be deserving
will you take advantage of a #man# nature to do him out of the price of his own #daughter# what he brought up and fed and clothed by the sweat of his brow until she growed big enough to be interesting to you two gentlemen
i undeserving and i mean to go on being undeserving i like it and that the truth is five pounds unreasonable
$pickering$ if we were to take this #man# in hand for three months he could choose between a seat in the cabinet and a popular pulpit in wales
i put it to you and i leave it to you $mrs_higgins$ rising and going over to $pickering$ $pickering$ what do you say to that $eliza_doolittle$
i ve heard all the preachers and all the prime ministers for i a thinking #man# and game for politics or religion or social reform same as all the other amusements and i tell you it a dog life
$eliza_doolittle$ not me governor thank you kindly anyway you look at it undeserving poverty is my line taking one station in society with another it s
it well it the only one that has any ginger in it to my taste $mrs_higgins$ i suppose we must give him a fiver
$pickering$ he ll make a bad use of it i afraid $eliza_doolittle$ not me governor so help me i wont dont you be afraid that i ll save it and spare it and live idle on it
there wont be a penny of it left by monday i ll have to go to work same as if i never had it
just one good spree for myself and the missus giving pleasure to ourselves and employment to others and satisfaction to you to think it not been throwed away
it wont pauperize me you bet you couldnt spend it better $mrs_higgins$ taking out his pocket book and coming between $eliza_doolittle$ and the piano
this is irresistible let give him ten he offers two notes to the dustman $eliza_doolittle$ no governor she wouldnt have the heart to spend ten and perhaps i shouldnt neither
ten pounds is a lot of money it makes a #man# feel prudent like and then goodbye to happiness you give me what i ask you
governor not a penny more and not a penny less $pickering$ why dont you marry that missus of yours i rather draw the line at encouraging that sort of immorality
$eliza_doolittle$ tell her so governor tell her so i willing it me that suffers by it i ve no hold on her
i got to be agreeable to her i got to give her presents i got to buy her clothes something sinful
i a slave to that #woman# governor just because i not her lawful husband and she knows it too catch her marrying me
take my advice governor marry $eliza_doolittle$ while she young and dont know no better if you dont you ll be sorry for it after
if you do she ll be sorry for it after but better you than her because you re a #man# and she only a #woman# and dont know how to be happy anyhow
$mrs_higgins$ $pickering$ if we listen to this #man# another minute we shall have no convictions left to $eliza_doolittle$ five pounds i think you said
$eliza_doolittle$ thank you kindly governor $mrs_higgins$ you re sure you wont take ten $eliza_doolittle$ not now another time governor $mrs_higgins$ handing him a five pound note
here you are $eliza_doolittle$ thank you governor good morning he hurries to the door anxious to get away with his booty

$mrs_higgins$ i glad the bath room met with your approval $liza$ it didnt not all of it and i dont care who hears me say it
$mrs_pearce$ knows $mrs_higgins$ what was wrong $mrs_pearce$ $mrs_pearce$ blandly oh nothing sir it doesnt matter $liza$ i had a good mind to break it
i didnt know which #way# to look but i hung a towel over it i did $mrs_higgins$ over what $mrs_pearce$
over the looking glass sir $mrs_higgins$ $eliza_doolittle$ you have brought your #daughter# up too strictly $eliza_doolittle$ me i never brought her up at all except to give her a lick of a strap now and again
dont put it on me governor she aint accustomed to it you see that all but she ll soon pick up your free and easy #way#
$liza$ i a good #girl# i am and i wont pick up no free and easy #way# $mrs_higgins$ $eliza_doolittle$ if you say again that you re a good #girl# your father shall take you home
$liza$ not him you dont know my father all he come here for was to touch you for some money to get drunk on
$eliza_doolittle$ well what else would i want money for to put into the plate in church i suppose she puts out her tongue at him
dont you give me none of your lip and dont let me hear you giving this gentleman any of it neither or you ll hear from me about it
he is so incensed by this that $pickering$ presently finds it necessary to step between them see $mrs_higgins$ have you any further advice to give her before you go $eliza_doolittle$
your blessing for instance $eliza_doolittle$ no governor i aint such a mug as to put up my children to all i know myself
hard enough to hold them in without that if you want $eliza_doolittle$ mind improved governor you do it yourself with a strap
so long gentlemen he turns to go $mrs_higgins$ impressively stop you ll come regularly to see your #daughter# it your duty you know
my brother is a clergyman and he could help you in your talks with her $eliza_doolittle$ evasively certainly i ll come governor
not just this week because i have a job at a distance but later on you may depend on me afternoon gentlemen
afternoon ma am he takes off his hat to $mrs_pearce$ who disdains the salutation and goes out he winks at $mrs_higgins$ thinking him probably a fellow sufferer from $mrs_pearce$ difficult disposition and follows her $liza$
dont you believe the old liar he as soon you set a bull dog on him as a clergyman you wont see him again in a hurry
$mrs_higgins$ i dont want to $eliza_doolittle$ do you $liza$ not me i dont want never to see him again i dont
he a disgrace to me he is collecting dust instead of working at his trade $pickering$ what is his trade $eliza_doolittle$
$liza$ talking money out of other people pockets into his own his proper trade a navvy and he works at it sometimes too for exercise and earns good money at it
aint you going to call me miss $eliza_doolittle$ any more $pickering$ i beg your pardon miss $eliza_doolittle$ it was a slip of the tongue
i should just like to take a taxi to the corner of tottenham court road and get out there and tell it to wait for me just to put the #girl# in their place a bit
$liza$ oh i dont mind only it sounded so genteel i wouldnt speak to them you know $pickering$ better wait til we get you something really fashionable
$mrs_higgins$ besides you shouldnt cut your old friends now that you have risen in the world that what we call snobbery
they ve took it out of me often enough with their ridicule when they had the chance and now i mean to get a bit of my own back
$liza$ you dont call the like of them my friends now i should hope but if i to have fashionable clothes i ll wait
$mrs_pearce$ says you re going to give me some to wear in bed at night different to what i wear in the daytime but it do seem a waste of money when you could get something to show
i should like to have some besides i never could fancy changing into cold #thing# on a winter night $mrs_pearce$ coming back
now $eliza_doolittle$ the new #thing# have come for you to try on $liza$ ah ow oo ooh she rushes out $mrs_pearce$ following her
oh dont rush about like that #girl# she shuts the door behind her $mrs_higgins$ $pickering$ we have taken on a stiff job
her drawing room in a flat on chelsea embankment has three windows looking on the river and the ceiling is not so lofty as it would be in an older house of the same pretension
$pickering$ with conviction $mrs_higgins$ we have act iii it is $mrs_higgins$ at home day nobody has yet arrived the windows are open giving access to a balcony with flowers in pots
if you stand with your face to the windows you have the fireplace on your left and the door in the #right# hand wall close to the corner nearest the windows
$mrs_higgins$ was brought up on morris and burne jones and her room which is very unlike her son room in wimpole street is not crowded with furniture and little tables and nicknacks
in the middle of the room there is a big ottoman and this with the carpet the morris wall papers and the morris chintz window curtains and brocade covers of the ottoman and its cushions supply all the ornament and are much too handsome to be hidden by odds and ends of useless #thing#
a few good oil paintings from the exhibitions in the grosvenor gallery thirty years ago the burne jones not the whistler side of them are on the walls
there is a portrait of $mrs_higgins$ as she was when she defied fashion in her youth in one of the beautiful rossettian costumes which when caricatured by people who did not understand led to the absurdities of popular estheticism in the eighteen seventies
in the corner diagonally opposite the door $mrs_higgins$ now over sixty and long past taking the trouble to dress out of the fashion sits writing at an elegantly simple writing table with a bell button within reach of her hand
the only landscape is a cecil lawson on the scale of a rubens there is a chippendale chair further back in the room between her and the window nearest her side
at the other side of the room further forward is an elizabethan chair roughly carved in the taste of inigo jones
on the same side a piano in a decorated case the corner between the fireplace and the window is occupied by a divan cushioned in morris chintz
it is between four and five in the afternoon the door is opened violently and $mrs_higgins$ enters with his hat on
$mrs_higgins$ dismayed $henry_higgins$ scolding him what are you doing here to day it is my at home day you promised not to come
as he bends to kiss her she takes his hat off and presents it to him $mrs_higgins$ oh bother he throws the hat down on the table mrs
$mrs_higgins$ go home at once $mrs_higgins$ kissing her i know #mother# i came on purpose $mrs_higgins$ but you mustnt i serious $henry_higgins$
you offend all my friends they stop coming whenever they meet you $mrs_higgins$ nonsense i know i have no small talk but people dont mind
he sits on the settee $mrs_higgins$ oh dont they small talk indeed what about your large talk really dear you mustnt stay
i sorry but i cant get round your vowels and though i like to get pretty postcards in your patent shorthand i always have to read the copies in ordinary writing you so thoughtfully send me
$mrs_higgins$ i must i ve a job for you a #phonetic# job $mrs_higgins$ no use dear $mrs_higgins$ well this isnt a #phonetic# job
$mrs_higgins$ you said it was $mrs_higgins$ not your part of it i ve picked up a #girl# $mrs_higgins$ does that mean that some #girl# has picked you up
$mrs_higgins$ not at all i dont mean a love affair $mrs_higgins$ what a pity $mrs_higgins$ why $mrs_higgins$ well you never fall in love with anyone under forty five
when will you discover that there are some rather nice looking young #woman# about $mrs_higgins$ oh i cant be bothered with young #woman#
my idea of a loveable #woman# is something as like you as possible i shall never get into the #way# of seriously liking young #woman# some habits lie too deep to be changed
rising abruptly and walking about jingling his money and his keys in his trouser pockets besides they re all idiots $mrs_higgins$
do you know what you would do if you really loved me $henry_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ oh bother what marry i suppose mrs
$mrs_higgins$ no stop fidgeting and take your hands out of your pockets with a gesture of despair he obeys and sits down again
that a good boy now tell me about the #girl# $mrs_higgins$ she coming to see you $mrs_higgins$ i dont remember asking her
$mrs_higgins$ you didnt i asked her if you known her you wouldnt have asked her $mrs_higgins$ indeed why $mrs_higgins$ well it like this
she a common flower #girl# i picked her off the kerbstone $mrs_higgins$ and invited her to my at home $mrs_higgins$ rising and coming to her to coax her
oh that ll be all #right# i ve taught her to speak properly and she has strict orders as to her behavior she to keep to two subjects the weather and everybody health
fine day and how do you do you know and not to let herself go on #thing# in general that will be safe
$mrs_higgins$ safe to talk about our health about our insides perhaps about our outsides how could you be so silly $henry_higgins$
$mrs_higgins$ impatiently well she must talk about something he controls himself and sits down again oh she ll be all #right# dont you fuss
$pickering$ is in it with me i ve a sort of bet on that i ll pass her off as a duchess in six months
i started on her some months ago and she getting on like a house on fire i shall win my bet
she has a quick ear and she been easier to teach than my middle class pupils because she had to learn a complete new language
she talks english almost as you talk french $mrs_higgins$ that satisfactory at all events $mrs_higgins$ well it is and it isnt
you see i ve got her pronunciation all #right# but you have to consider not only how a #girl# pronounces but what she pronounces and that where
$mrs_higgins$ what does that mean $mrs_higgins$ they are interrupted by the parlor maid announcing guests the parlor maid mrs and miss eynsford hill
he rises snatches his hat from the table and makes for the door but before he reaches it his #mother# introduces him mrs and miss eynsford hill are the #mother# and #daughter# who sheltered from the rain in covent garden
she withdraws $mrs_higgins$ oh lord the #mother# is well bred quiet and has the habitual anxiety of straitened means the #daughter# has acquired a gay air of being very much at home in society the bravado of genteel poverty
mrs eynsford hill to $mrs_higgins$ how do you do they shake hands miss eynsford hill how you do she shakes mrs
$mrs_higgins$ introducing my son $henry_higgins$ mrs eynsford hill your celebrated son i have so longed to meet you professor $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$
glumly making no movement in her direction delighted he backs against the piano and bows brusquely miss eynsford hill going to him with confident familiarity
how do you do $mrs_higgins$ staring at her i ve seen you before somewhere i havent the ghost of a notion where but i ve heard your voice
drearily it doesnt matter you better sit down $mrs_higgins$ i sorry to say that my celebrated son has no #manner#
you mustnt mind him miss eynsford hill gaily i dont she sits in the elizabethan chair mrs eynsford hill a little bewildered not at all
she sits on the ottoman between her #daughter# and $mrs_higgins$ who has turned her chair away from the writing table $mrs_higgins$
he goes to the central window through which with his back to the company he contemplates the river and the flowers in battersea park on the opposite bank as if they were a frozen dessert
oh have i been rude i didnt mean to be the parlor maid returns ushering in $pickering$ the parlor maid colonel $pickering$ she withdraws $pickering$
how do you do $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ so glad you ve come do you know mrs eynsford hill miss eynsford hill exchange of bows
the colonel brings the chippendale chair a little forward between mrs hill and $mrs_higgins$ and sits down $pickering$ has $henry_higgins$ told you what we ve come for
$mrs_higgins$ over his shoulder we were interrupted damn it $mrs_higgins$ oh $henry_higgins$ henry really mrs eynsford hill half rising are we in the #way#
$mrs_higgins$ rising and making her sit down again no no you couldnt have come more fortunately we want you to meet a friend of ours
$mrs_higgins$ turning hopefully yes by $george$ we want two or three people you ll do as well as anybody else the parlor maid returns ushering $freddy$
the parlor maid mr eynsford hill $mrs_higgins$ almost audibly past endurance god of heaven another of them $freddy$ shaking hands with $mrs_higgins$
ahdedo $mrs_higgins$ very good of you to come introducing colonel $pickering$ $freddy$ bowing ahdedo $mrs_higgins$ i dont think you know my son professor $mrs_higgins$
$freddy$ going to $mrs_higgins$ ahdedo $mrs_higgins$ looking at him much as if he were a pickpocket i ll take my oath i ve met you before somewhere
he shakes $freddy$ hand and almost slings him on the ottoman with his face to the windows then comes round to the other side of it
where was it $freddy$ i dont think so $mrs_higgins$ resignedly it dont matter anyhow sit down $mrs_higgins$ well here we are anyhow
he sits down on the ottoman next mrs eynsford hill on her left and now what the #devil# are we going to talk about until $eliza_doolittle$ comes
$henry_higgins$ you are the life and soul of the royal society soirees but really you re rather trying on more commonplace occasions
$mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ am i very sorry beaming suddenly i suppose i am you know uproariously ha ha miss eynsford hill who considers $mrs_higgins$ quite eligible matrimonially
i sympathize i havent any small talk if people would only be frank and say what they really think $mrs_higgins$ relapsing into gloom lord forbid
what they think they ought to think is bad enough lord knows but what they really think would break up the whole show
mrs eynsford hill taking up her #daughter# cue but why $mrs_higgins$ do you suppose it would be really agreeable if i were to come out now with what i really think
miss eynsford hill gaily is it so very cynical $mrs_higgins$ cynical who the dickens said it was cynical i mean it wouldnt be decent
mrs eynsford hill seriously oh i sure you dont mean that mr $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ you see we re all savages more or less
we re supposed to be civilized and cultured to know all about poetry and philosophy and art and science and so on but how many of us know even the meanings of these names
to miss hill what do you know of poetry to mrs hill what do you know of science indicating $freddy$ what does he know of art or science or anything else
what the #devil# do you imagine i know of philosophy $mrs_higgins$ warningly or of #manner# $henry_higgins$ the parlor maid opening the door
he stands on tiptoe and makes signs over his #mother# head to $eliza_doolittle$ to indicate to her which lady is her hostess $eliza_doolittle$ who is exquisitely dressed produces an impression of such remarkable distinction and beauty as she enters that they all rise quite flustered
miss $eliza_doolittle$ she withdraws $mrs_higgins$ rising hastily and running to $mrs_higgins$ here she is #mother# guided by $mrs_higgins$ signals she comes to $mrs_higgins$ with studied grace
$liza$ speaking with pedantic correctness of pronunciation and great beauty of tone how do you do $mrs_higgins$ she gasps slightly in making sure of the in $mrs_higgins$ but is quite successful
mr $mrs_higgins$ told me i might come $mrs_higgins$ cordially quite #right# i very glad indeed to see you $pickering$ how do you do miss $eliza_doolittle$
$liza$ shaking hands with him colonel $pickering$ is it not mrs eynsford hill i feel sure we have met before miss $eliza_doolittle$
i remember your eyes $liza$ how do you do she sits down on the ottoman gracefully in the place just left vacant by $mrs_higgins$ mrs
she sits down on the ottoman beside $eliza_doolittle$ devouring her with her eyes $freddy$ coming to their side of the ottoman
eynsford hill introducing my #daughter# $clara$ $liza$ how do you do $clara$ impulsively how do you do i ve certainly had the pleasure
mrs eynsford hill introducing my son $freddy$ $liza$ how do you do $freddy$ bows and sits down in the elizabethan chair infatuated
$mrs_higgins$ suddenly by $george$ yes it all comes back to me they stare at him covent garden lamentably what a damned #thing#
$mrs_higgins$ $henry_higgins$ please he is about to sit on the edge of the table dont sit on my writing table you ll break it
he goes to the divan stumbling into the fender and over the fire irons on his #way# extricating himself with muttered imprecations and finishing his disastrous journey by throwing himself so impatiently on the divan that he almost breaks it
$mrs_higgins$ sulkily sorry $mrs_higgins$ looks at him but controls herself and says nothing a long and painful pause ensues mrs
$mrs_higgins$ at last conversationally will it rain do you think $liza$ the shallow depression in the west of these islands is likely to move slowly in an easterly direction
there are no indications of any great change in the barometrical situation $freddy$ ha ha how awfully funny $liza$ what is wrong with that young #man#
i bet i got it #right# $freddy$ killing mrs eynsford hill i sure i hope it wont turn cold there so much influenza about
it runs #right# through our whole family regularly every spring $liza$ darkly my aunt died of influenza so they said mrs
eynsford hill clicks her tongue sympathetically $liza$ in the same tragic tone but it my belief they done the old #woman# in
$mrs_higgins$ puzzled done her in $liza$ e e es lord love you why should she die of influenza she come through diphtheria #right# enough the year before
they all thought she was dead but my father he kept ladling gin down her throat til she came to so sudden that she bit the bowl off the spoon
i saw her with my own eyes fairly blue with it she was mrs eynsford hill startled dear me $liza$ piling up the indictment
what call would a #woman# with that strength in her have to die of influenza what become of her new straw hat that should have come to me
somebody pinched it and what i say is them as pinched it done her in mrs eynsford hill what does doing her in mean
$mrs_higgins$ hastily oh that the new small talk to do a person in means to kill them mrs eynsford hill to $eliza_doolittle$ horrified
you surely dont believe that your aunt was killed $liza$ do i not them she lived with would have killed her for a hat pin let alone a hat
mrs eynsford hill but it cant have been #right# for your father to pour spirits down her throat like that it might have killed her
$liza$ not her gin was #mother# milk to her besides he poured so much down his own throat that he knew the good of it
mrs eynsford hill do you mean that he drank $liza$ drank my word something chronic mrs eynsford hill how dreadful for you
$liza$ not a bit it never did him no harm what i could see but then he did not keep it up regular
cheerfully on the burst as you might say from time to time and always more agreeable when he had a drop in
when he was out of work my #mother# used to give him fourpence and tell him to go out and not come back until he drunk himself cheerful and loving like
there lots of #woman# has to make their husbands drunk to make them fit to live with now quite at her ease you see it like this
if a #man# has a bit of a conscience it always takes him when he sober and then it makes him low spirited
a drop of booze just takes that off and makes him happy to $freddy$ who is in convulsions of suppressed laughter
here what are you sniggering at $freddy$ the new small talk you do it so awfully well $liza$ if i was doing it proper what was you laughing at
to $mrs_higgins$ have i said anything i oughtnt $mrs_higgins$ interposing not at all miss $eliza_doolittle$ $liza$ well that a mercy anyhow
expansively what i always say is $mrs_higgins$ rising and looking at his watch ahem $liza$ looking round at him taking the hint and rising
well i must go they all rise $freddy$ goes to the door so pleased to have met you good bye she shakes hands with $mrs_higgins$ mrs
$mrs_higgins$ good bye $liza$ good bye colonel $pickering$ $pickering$ good bye miss $eliza_doolittle$ they shake hands $liza$ nodding to the others good bye all $freddy$ opening the door for her
are you walking across the park miss $eliza_doolittle$ if so $liza$ walk not bloody likely sensation i am going in a taxi
she goes out $pickering$ gasps and sits down $freddy$ goes out on the balcony to catch another glimpse of $eliza_doolittle$ mrs
eynsford hill suffering from shock well i really cant get used to the new #way# $clara$ throwing herself discontentedly into the elizabethan chair oh it all #right# mamma quite #right#
people will think we never go anywhere or see anybody if you are so old fashioned mrs eynsford hill i daresay i am very old fashioned but i do hope you wont begin using that expression $clara$
i have got accustomed to hear you talking about #man# as rotters and calling everything filthy and beastly though i do think it horrible and unladylike
i ve been away in india for several years and #manner# have changed so much that i sometimes dont know whether i at a respectable dinner table or in a ship forecastle
but this last is really too much dont you think so colonel $pickering$ $pickering$ dont ask me $clara$ it all a matter of habit
there no #right# or wrong in it nobody means anything by it and it so quaint and gives such a smart emphasis to #thing# that are not in themselves very witty
i find the new small talk delightful and quite innocent mrs eynsford hill rising well after that i think it time for us to go
$pickering$ and $mrs_higgins$ rise $clara$ rising oh yes we have three at homes to go to still good bye $mrs_higgins$
good bye colonel $pickering$ good bye professor $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ coming grimly at her from the divan and accompanying her to the door good bye
be sure you try on that small talk at the three at homes dont be nervous about it pitch it in strong
$clara$ all smiles i will good bye such nonsense all this early victorian prudery $mrs_higgins$ tempting her such damned nonsense $clara$ such bloody nonsense
she goes out radiant conscious of being thoroughly up to date and is heard descending the stairs in a stream of silvery laughter $freddy$ to the heavens at large
mrs eynsford hill convulsively $clara$ clara ha ha well i ask you he gives it up and comes to $mrs_higgins$ good bye
$mrs_higgins$ shaking hands good bye would you like to meet miss $eliza_doolittle$ again $freddy$ eagerly yes i should most awfully mrs
$mrs_higgins$ well you know my days $freddy$ yes thanks awfully good bye he goes out mrs eynsford hill good bye mr $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$
good bye good bye mrs eynsford hill to $pickering$ it no use i shall never be able to bring myself to use that word
$pickering$ dont it not compulsory you know you ll get on quite well without it mrs eynsford hill only $clara$ is so down on me if i am not positively reeking with the latest slang
$pickering$ catching from her lowered tone that this is not meant for him to hear discreetly joins $mrs_higgins$ at the window
good bye $pickering$ good bye they shake hands mrs eynsford hill to $mrs_higgins$ you mustnt mind $clara$ we re so poor and she gets so few parties poor child
she doesnt quite know $mrs_higgins$ seeing that her eyes are moist takes her hand sympathetically and goes with her to the door
but the boy is nice dont you think so $mrs_higgins$ oh quite nice i shall always be delighted to see him
he swoops on his #mother# and drags her to the ottoman where she sits down in $eliza_doolittle$ place with her son on her left
mrs eynsford hill thank you dear good bye she goes out $mrs_higgins$ eagerly well is $eliza_doolittle$ presentable $pickering$ returns to his chair on her #right#
she a triumph of your art and of her dressmaker but if you suppose for a moment that she doesnt give herself away in every sentence she utters you must be perfectly cracked about her
$mrs_higgins$ you silly boy of course she not presentable $pickering$ but dont you think something might be done i mean something to eliminate the sanguinary element from her conversation
$mrs_higgins$ not as long as she is in $henry_higgins$ hands $mrs_higgins$ aggrieved do you mean that my language is improper
no dearest it would be quite proper say on a canal barge but it would not be proper for her at a garden party
$mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ deeply injured well i must say $pickering$ interrupting him come $mrs_higgins$ you must learn to know yourself i havent heard such language as yours since we used to review the volunteers in hyde park twenty years ago
$mrs_higgins$ sulkily oh well if you say so i suppose i dont always talk like a bishop $mrs_higgins$ quieting $henry_higgins$ with a touch
colonel $pickering$ will you tell me what is the exact state of #thing# in wimpole street $pickering$ cheerfully as if this completely changed the subject well i have come to live there with $henry_higgins$
we work together at my indian dialects and we think it more convenient $mrs_higgins$ quite so i know all about that it an excellent arrangement
but where does this #girl# live $mrs_higgins$ with us of course where would she live $mrs_higgins$ but on what terms
is she a servant if not what is she $pickering$ slowly i think i know what you mean $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$
well dash me if i do i ve had to work at the #girl# every day for months to get her to her present pitch
besides she useful she knows where my #thing# are and remembers my appointments and so forth $mrs_higgins$ how does your housekeeper get on with her
oh she jolly glad to get so much taken off her hands for before $eliza_doolittle$ came she had to have to find #thing# and remind me of my appointments
$mrs_higgins$ $mrs_pearce$ but she got some silly bee in her bonnet about $eliza_doolittle$ she keeps saying you dont think sir doesnt she pick
$pickering$ yes that the formula you dont think sir that the end of every conversation about $eliza_doolittle$ $mrs_higgins$ as if i ever stop thinking about the #girl# and her confounded vowels and consonants
i worn out thinking about her and watching her lips and her teeth and her tongue not to mention her soul which is the quaintest of the lot
$mrs_higgins$ you certainly are a pretty pair of babies playing with your live doll $mrs_higgins$ playing the hardest job i ever tackled make no mistake about that #mother#
but you have no idea how frightfully interesting it is to take a human being and change her into a quite different human being by creating a new speech for her
it filling up the deepest gulf that separates class from class and soul from soul $pickering$ drawing his chair closer to $mrs_higgins$ and bending over to her eagerly
yes it enormously interesting i assure you $mrs_higgins$ we take $eliza_doolittle$ very seriously every week every day almost there is some new change
closer again we keep records of every stage dozens of gramophone disks and photographs $mrs_higgins$ assailing her at the other ear yes by $george$ it the most absorbing experiment i ever tackled
she regularly fills our lives up doesnt she pick $pickering$ we re always talking $eliza_doolittle$ $mrs_higgins$ teaching $eliza_doolittle$ $pickering$ dressing $eliza_doolittle$ mrs
$mrs_higgins$ what $mrs_higgins$ inventing new elizas $mrs_higgins$ and $pickering$ speaking together $mrs_higgins$ you know she has the most extraordinary quickness of ear $pickering$
i assure you my dear $mrs_higgins$ that #girl# $mrs_higgins$ just like a parrot i ve tried her with every $pickering$ is a genius
she can play the piano quite beautifully $mrs_higgins$ possible sort of sound that a human being can make $pickering$ we have taken her to classical concerts and to music $mrs_higgins$
continental dialects african dialects hottentot $pickering$ halls and it all the same to her she plays everything $mrs_higgins$ clicks #thing# it took me years to get hold of and $pickering$
she hears #right# off when she comes home whether it $mrs_higgins$ she picks them up like a shot #right# away as if she had $pickering$
beethoven and brahms or lehar and lionel morickton $mrs_higgins$ been at it all her life $pickering$ though six months ago she never as much as touched a piano
$mrs_higgins$ putting her fingers in her ears as they are by this time shouting one another down with an intolerable noise
sh sh sh sh they stop $pickering$ i beg your pardon he draws his chair back apologetically $mrs_higgins$ sorry when $pickering$ starts shouting nobody can get a word in edgeways
$mrs_higgins$ be quiet $henry_higgins$ colonel $pickering$ dont you realize that when $eliza_doolittle$ walked into wimpole street something walked in with her
$pickering$ her father did but $henry_higgins$ soon got rid of him $mrs_higgins$ it would have been more to the point if her #mother# had
but as her #mother# didnt something else did $pickering$ but what $mrs_higgins$ unconsciously dating herself by the word a problem
$pickering$ oh i see the problem of how to pass her off as a lady $mrs_higgins$ i ll solve that problem i ve half solved it already
$mrs_higgins$ no you two infinitely stupid male creatures the problem of what is to be done with her afterwards $mrs_higgins$
i dont see anything in that she can go her own #way# with all the advantages i have given her mrs
the #manner# and habits that disqualify a fine lady from earning her own living without giving her a fine lady income
$mrs_higgins$ the advantages of that poor #woman# who was here just now is that what you mean $pickering$ indulgently being rather bored
oh that will be all #right# $mrs_higgins$ he rises to go $mrs_higgins$ rising also we ll find her some light employment
$pickering$ she happy enough dont you worry about her good bye he shakes hands as if he were consoling a frightened child and makes for the door $mrs_higgins$
anyhow there no good bothering now the #thing# done good bye #mother# he kisses her and follows $pickering$ $pickering$ turning for a final consolation
there are plenty of openings we ll do what #right# good bye $mrs_higgins$ to $pickering$ as they go out together let take her to the shakespear exhibition at earls court
$pickering$ yes let her remarks will be delicious $mrs_higgins$ she ll mimic all the people for us when we get home $pickering$
ripping both are heard laughing as they go downstairs $mrs_higgins$ rises with an impatient bounce and returns to her work at the writing table
she sweeps a litter of disarranged papers out of her #way# snatches a sheet of paper from her stationery case and tries resolutely to write
at the third line she gives it up flings down her pen grips the table angrily and exclaims oh #man# #man#
#man# act iv the wimpole street laboratory midnight nobody in the room the clock on the mantelpiece strikes twelve the fire is not alight it is a summer night
presently $mrs_higgins$ and $pickering$ are heard on the stairs $mrs_higgins$ calling down to $pickering$ i say pick lock up will you
i shant be going out again $pickering$ #right# can $mrs_pearce$ go to bed we dont want anything more do we
$eliza_doolittle$ opens the door and is seen on the lighted landing in opera cloak brilliant evening dress and diamonds with fan flowers and all accessories
$mrs_higgins$ lord no she comes to the hearth and switches on the electric lights there she is tired her pallor contrasts strongly with her dark eyes and hair and her expression is almost tragic
she takes off her cloak puts her fan and flowers on the piano and sits down on the bench brooding and silent
he takes off the hat and overcoat throws them carelessly on the newspaper stand disposes of his coat in the same #way# puts on the smoking jacket and throws himself wearily into the easy chair at the hearth
$mrs_higgins$ in evening dress with overcoat and hat comes in carrying a smoking jacket which he has picked up downstairs $pickering$ similarly attired comes in
he also takes off his hat and overcoat and is about to throw them on $mrs_higgins$ when he hesitates $pickering$ i say $mrs_pearce$ will row if we leave these #thing# lying about in the drawing room
$mrs_higgins$ oh chuck them over the bannisters into the hall she ll find them there in the morning and put them away all #right#
she ll think we were drunk $pickering$ we are slightly are there any letters $mrs_higgins$ i didnt look $pickering$ takes the overcoats and hats and goes down stairs
$mrs_higgins$ begins half singing half yawning an air from la fanciulla del golden west suddenly he stops and exclaims i wonder where the #devil# my slippers are
$eliza_doolittle$ looks at him darkly then leaves the room $mrs_higgins$ yawns again and resumes his song $pickering$ returns with the contents of the letter box in his hand
he throws the circulars into the fender and posts himself on the hearthrug with his back to the grate $mrs_higgins$ glancing at the billet doux money lender
$pickering$ only circulars and this coroneted billet doux for you he throws the letter after the circulars $eliza_doolittle$ returns with a pair of large down at heel slippers
she places them on the carpet before $mrs_higgins$ and sits as before without a word $mrs_higgins$ yawning again oh lord what an evening
what a crew what a silly tomfoollery he raises his shoe to unlace it and catches sight of the slippers he stops unlacing and looks at them as if they had appeared there of their own accord oh
they re there are they $pickering$ stretching himself well i feel a bit tired it been a long day the garden party a dinner party and the opera
rather too much of a good #thing# but you ve won your bet $mrs_higgins$ $eliza_doolittle$ did the trick and something to spare eh
$mrs_higgins$ fervently thank god it over $eliza_doolittle$ flinches violently but they take no notice of her and she recovers herself and sits stonily as before
$pickering$ were you nervous at the garden party i was $eliza_doolittle$ didnt seem a bit nervous $mrs_higgins$ oh she wasnt nervous
i knew she be all #right# no it the strain of putting the job through all these months that has told on me
it was interesting enough at first while we were at the #phonetic# but after that i got deadly sick of it
if i hadnt backed myself to do it i should have chucked the whole #thing# up two months ago it was a silly notion the whole #thing# has been a bore
$pickering$ oh come the garden party was frightfully exciting my heart began beating like anything $mrs_higgins$ yes for the first three minutes
but when i saw we were going to win hands down i felt like a bear in a cage hanging about doing nothing
the dinner was worse sitting gorging there for over an hour with nobody but a damned fool of a fashionable #woman# to talk to
i tell you $pickering$ never again for me no more artificial duchesses the whole #thing# has been simple purgatory $pickering$ you ve never been broken in properly to the social routine
strolling over to the piano i rather enjoy dipping into it occasionally myself it makes me feel young again anyhow it was a great success an immense success
you see lots of the real people cant do it at all they re such fools that they think style comes by nature to people in their position and so they never learn
i was quite frightened once or twice because $eliza_doolittle$ was doing it so well there always something professional about doing a #thing# superlatively well
$mrs_higgins$ yes that what drives me mad the silly people dont know their own silly business rising however it over and done with and now i can go to bed at last without dreading tomorrow
$eliza_doolittle$ beauty becomes murderous $pickering$ i think i shall turn in too still it been a great occasion a triumph for you
over his shoulder at the door put out the lights $eliza_doolittle$ and tell $mrs_pearce$ not to make coffee for me in the morning i ll take tea
he goes out $eliza_doolittle$ tries to control herself and feel indifferent as she rises and walks across to the hearth to switch off the lights
good night he goes $mrs_higgins$ following him good night by the time she gets there she is on the point of screaming she sits down in $mrs_higgins$ chair and holds on hard to the arms
finally she gives #way# and flings herself furiously on the floor raging $mrs_higgins$ in despairing wrath outside what the #devil# have i done with my slippers
he appears at the door $liza$ snatching up the slippers and hurling them at him one after the other with all her force
there are your slippers and there take your slippers and may you never have a day luck with them $mrs_higgins$ astounded
what on earth he comes to her what the matter get up he pulls her up anything wrong $liza$ breathless nothing wrong with you
i ve won your bet for you havent i that enough for you i dont matter i suppose $mrs_higgins$ you won my bet
you presumptuous insect i won it what did you throw those slippers at me for $liza$ because i wanted to smash your face
i like to kill you you selfish brute why didnt you leave me where you picked me out of in the gutter
you thank god it all over and that now you can throw me back again there do you she crisps her fingers frantically $mrs_higgins$
looking at her in cool wonder the creature is nervous after all $liza$ gives a suffocated scream of fury and instinctively darts her nails at his face
$mrs_higgins$ catching her wrists ah would you claws in you cat how dare you show your temper to me sit down and be quiet
he throws her roughly into the easy chair $liza$ crushed by superior strength and weight what to become of me what to become of me
$mrs_higgins$ how the #devil# do i know what to become of you what does it matter what becomes of you $liza$
you dont care i know you dont care you wouldnt care if i was dead i nothing to you not so much as them slippers
$mrs_higgins$ thundering those slippers $liza$ with bitter submission those slippers i didnt think it made any difference now a pause $eliza_doolittle$ hopeless and crushed
$mrs_higgins$ a little uneasy $mrs_higgins$ in his loftiest #manner# why have you begun going on like this may i ask whether you complain of your treatment here
$liza$ no $mrs_higgins$ has anybody behaved badly to you colonel $pickering$ $mrs_pearce$ any of the servants $liza$ no $mrs_higgins$ i presume you dont pretend that i have treated you badly
$liza$ no $mrs_higgins$ i am glad to hear it he moderates his tone perhaps you re tired after the strain of the day
will you have a glass of champagne he moves towards the door $liza$ no recollecting her #manner# thank you $mrs_higgins$ good humored again
this has been coming on you for some days i suppose it was natural for you to be anxious about the garden party
but that all over now he pats her kindly on the shoulder she writhes there nothing more to worry about $liza$
she suddenly rises and gets away from him by going to the piano bench where she sits and hides her face oh god
no nothing more for you to worry about i wish i was dead $mrs_higgins$ staring after her in sincere surprise why in heaven name why
reasonably going to her listen to me $eliza_doolittle$ all this irritation is purely subjective $liza$ i dont understand i too ignorant
$mrs_higgins$ it only imagination low spirits and nothing else nobody hurting you nothing wrong you go to bed like a good #girl# and sleep it off
have a little cry and say your prayers that will make you comfortable $liza$ i heard your prayers thank god it all over
$mrs_higgins$ impatiently well dont you thank god it all over now you are free and can do what you like $liza$ pulling herself together in desperation
what am i fit for what have you left me fit for where am i to go what am i to do
he thrusts his hands into his pockets and walks about in his usual #manner# rattling the contents of his pockets as if condescending to a trivial subject out of pure kindness
what to become of me $mrs_higgins$ enlightened but not at all impressed oh that what worrying you is it i shouldnt bother about it if i were you
i should imagine you wont have much difficulty in settling yourself somewhere or other though i hadnt quite realized that you were going away
she looks quickly at him he does not look at her but examines the dessert stand on the piano and decides that he will eat an apple you might marry you know
he bites a large piece out of the apple and munches it noisily you see $eliza_doolittle$ all #man# are not confirmed old bachelors like me and the colonel
most #man# are the marrying sort poor #devil# and you re not bad looking it quite a pleasure to look at you sometimes not now of course because you re crying and looking as ugly as the very #devil# but when you re all #right# and quite yourself you re what i should call attractive
you go to bed and have a good nice rest and then get up and look at yourself in the glass and you wont feel so cheap
that is to the people in the marrying line you understand $eliza_doolittle$ again looks at him speechless and does not stir
the look is quite lost on him he eats his apple with a dreamy expression of happiness as it is quite a good one
$mrs_higgins$ a genial afterthought occurring to him i daresay my #mother# could find some chap or other who would do very well $liza$
we were above that at the corner of tottenham court road $mrs_higgins$ waking up what do you mean $liza$ i sold flowers
i didnt sell myself now you ve made a lady of me i not fit to sell anything else i wish you left me where you found me
$mrs_higgins$ slinging the core of the apple decisively into the grate tosh $eliza_doolittle$ dont you insult human relations by dragging all this cant about buying and selling into it
you neednt marry the fellow if you dont like him $liza$ what else am i to do $mrs_higgins$ oh lots of #thing#
what about your old idea of a florist shop $pickering$ could set you up in one he lots of money chuckling
he ll have to pay for all those togs you have been wearing today and that with the hire of the jewellery will make a big hole in two hundred pounds
why six months ago you would have thought it the millennium to have a flower shop of your own come you ll be all #right#
i must clear off to bed i devilish sleepy by the #way# i came down for something i forget what it was
$liza$ your slippers $mrs_higgins$ oh yes of course you shied them at me he picks them up and is going out when she rises and speaks to him $liza$
before you go sir $mrs_higgins$ dropping the slippers in his surprise at her calling him sir eh $liza$ do my clothes belong to me or to colonel $pickering$
$mrs_higgins$ coming back into the room as if her question were the very climax of unreason what the #devil# use would they be to $pickering$
$liza$ he might want them for the next #girl# you pick up to experiment on $mrs_higgins$ shocked and hurt is that the #way# you feel towards us
$liza$ i dont want to hear anything more about that all i want to know is whether anything belongs to me
my own clothes were burnt $mrs_higgins$ but what does it matter why need you start bothering about that in the middle of the night
$liza$ i want to know what i may take away with me i dont want to be accused of stealing $mrs_higgins$ now deeply wounded stealing
you shouldnt have said that $eliza_doolittle$ that shows a want of feeling $liza$ i sorry i only a common ignorant #girl# and in my station i have to be careful
there cant be any feelings between the like of you and the like of me please will you tell me what belongs to me and what doesnt
$mrs_higgins$ very sulky you may take the whole damned houseful if you like except the jewels they re hired will that satisfy you
he turns on his heel and is about to go in extreme dudgeon $liza$ drinking in his emotion like nectar and nagging him to provoke a further supply
stop please she takes off her jewels will you take these to your room and keep them safe i dont want to run the risk of their being missing
$mrs_higgins$ furious hand them over she puts them into his hands if these belonged to me instead of to the jeweler i ram them down your ungrateful throat
he perfunctorily thrusts them into his pockets unconsciously decorating himself with the protruding ends of the chains $liza$ taking a ring off
$mrs_higgins$ dashes the ring violently into the fireplace and turns on her so threateningly that she crouches over the piano with her hands over her face and exclaims
this ring isnt the jeweler it the one you bought me in brighton i dont want it now dont you hit me
$mrs_higgins$ hit you you infamous creature how dare you accuse me of such a #thing# it is you who have hit me
you have wounded me to the heart $liza$ thrilling with hidden joy i glad i ve got a little of my own back anyhow
$mrs_higgins$ with dignity in his finest professional style you have caused me to lose my temper a #thing# that has hardly ever happened to me before
i prefer to say nothing more tonight i am going to bed $liza$ pertly you better leave a note for $mrs_pearce$ about the coffee for she wont be told by me
damn $mrs_pearce$ and damn the coffee and damn you and damn my own folly in having lavished my hard earned knowledge and the treasure of my regard and intimacy on a heartless guttersnipe
he goes out with impressive decorum and spoils it by slamming the door savagely $eliza_doolittle$ smiles for the first time expresses her feelings by a wild pantomime in which an imitation of $mrs_higgins$ exit is confused with her own triumph and finally goes down on her knees on the hearthrug to look for the ring
$mrs_higgins$ formally act $mrs_higgins$ drawing room she is at her writing table as before the parlor maid comes in the parlor maid at the door mr $henry_higgins$ mam is downstairs with colonel $pickering$
$mrs_higgins$ well show them up the parlor maid they re using the telephone mam telephoning to the police i think $mrs_higgins$
what the parlor maid coming further in and lowering her voice mr $henry_higgins$ in a state mam i thought i better tell you
$mrs_higgins$ if you had told me that mr $henry_higgins$ was not in a state it would have been more surprising
tell them to come up when they ve finished with the police i suppose he lost something the parlor maid yes maam going mrs
$mrs_higgins$ go upstairs and tell miss $eliza_doolittle$ that mr $henry_higgins$ and the colonel are here ask her not to come down till i send for her
the parlor maid yes mam $mrs_higgins$ bursts in he is as the parlor maid has said in a state $mrs_higgins$ look here #mother# here a confounded #thing#
$mrs_higgins$ yes dear good morning he checks his impatience and kisses her whilst the parlor maid goes out what is it $mrs_higgins$
she was left last night as usual to turn out the lights and all that and instead of going to bed she changed her clothes and went #right# off her bed wasnt slept in
she came in a cab for her #thing# before seven this morning and that fool $mrs_pearce$ let her have them without telling me a word about it
$eliza_doolittle$ bolted $mrs_higgins$ calmly continuing her writing you must have frightened her $mrs_higgins$ frightened her nonsense what am i to do
$mrs_higgins$ do without i afraid $henry_higgins$ the #girl# has a perfect #right# to leave if she chooses $mrs_higgins$ wandering distractedly across the room
but i cant find anything i dont know what appointments i ve got i $pickering$ comes in $mrs_higgins$ puts down her pen and turns away from the writing table $pickering$ shaking hands good morning $mrs_higgins$
has $henry_higgins$ told you he sits down on the ottoman $mrs_higgins$ what does that ass of an inspector say have you offered a reward
$mrs_higgins$ rising in indignant amazement you dont mean to say you have set the police after $eliza_doolittle$ $mrs_higgins$ of course
what are the police for what else could we do he sits in the elizabethan chair $pickering$ the inspector made a lot of difficulties
what #right# have you to go to the police and give the #girl# name as if she were a thief or a lost umbrella or something
i really think he suspected us of some improper purpose $mrs_higgins$ well of course he did really she sits down again deeply vexed $mrs_higgins$
but we want to find her $pickering$ we cant let her go like this you know $mrs_higgins$ what were we to do
$mrs_higgins$ you have no more sense either of you than two children why the parlor maid comes in and breaks off the conversation
the parlor maid mr $henry_higgins$ a gentleman wants to see you very particular he been sent on from wimpole street $mrs_higgins$ oh bother
i cant see anyone now who is it the parlor maid a mr $eliza_doolittle$ sir $pickering$ $eliza_doolittle$ do you mean the dustman
the parlor maid dustman oh no sir a gentleman $mrs_higgins$ springing up excitedly by $george$ pick it some relative of hers that she gone to
somebody we know nothing about to the parlor maid send him up quick the parlor maid yes sir she goes $mrs_higgins$ eagerly going to his #mother#
genteel relatives now we shall hear something he sits down in the chippendale chair $mrs_higgins$ do you know any of her people
$pickering$ only her father the fellow we told you about the parlor maid announcing mr $eliza_doolittle$ she withdraws $eliza_doolittle$ enters he is brilliantly dressed in a new fashionable frock coat with white waistcoat and grey trousers
a flower in his buttonhole a dazzling silk hat and patent leather shoes complete the effect he is too concerned with the business he has come on to notice $mrs_higgins$
he walks straight to $mrs_higgins$ and accosts him with vehement reproach $eliza_doolittle$ indicating his own person see here do you see this
you done this $mrs_higgins$ done what #man# $eliza_doolittle$ this i tell you look at it look at this hat look at this coat
$pickering$ has $eliza_doolittle$ been buying you clothes $eliza_doolittle$ $eliza_doolittle$ not she not half why would she buy me clothes $mrs_higgins$
good morning mr $eliza_doolittle$ wont you sit down $eliza_doolittle$ taken aback as he becomes conscious that he has forgotten his hostess asking your pardon ma am
he approaches her and shakes her proffered hand thank you he sits down on the ottoman on $pickering$ #right# i am that full of what has happened to me that i cant think of anything else
$mrs_higgins$ what the dickens has happened to you $eliza_doolittle$ i shouldnt mind if it had only happened to me anything might happen to anybody and nobody to blame
but providence as you might say but this is something that you done to me yes you $henry_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ have you found $eliza_doolittle$
that the point $eliza_doolittle$ have you lost her $mrs_higgins$ yes $eliza_doolittle$ you have all the luck you have i aint found her but she ll find me quick enough now after what you done to me
$mrs_higgins$ but what has my son done to you mr $eliza_doolittle$ $eliza_doolittle$ done to me ruined me destroyed my happiness
tied me up and delivered me into the hands of middle class morality $mrs_higgins$ rising intolerantly and standing over $eliza_doolittle$ you re raving
you re drunk you re mad i gave you five pounds after that i had two conversations with you at half a crown an hour
did you or did you not write a letter to an old blighter in america that was giving five millions to found moral reform societies all over the world and that wanted you to invent a universal language for him
i ve never seen you since $eliza_doolittle$ oh drunk am i mad am i tell me this $mrs_higgins$ what ezra wannafeller
now did you or did you not write a letter to him to say that the most original moralist at present in england to the best of your knowledge was alfred $eliza_doolittle$ a common dustman
he dead he sits down again carelessly $eliza_doolittle$ yes he dead and i done for $mrs_higgins$ oh after your last visit i remember making some silly joke of the kind
just give him the chance he wanted to show that americans is not like us that they recognize and respect merit in every class of life however humble
them words is in his blooming will in which $henry_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ thanks to your silly joking he leaves me a share in his pre digested cheese trust worth three thousand a year on condition that i lecture for his wannafeller moral reform world league as often as they ask me up to six times a year
$eliza_doolittle$ ah you may well call it a silly joke it put the lid on me #right# enough $mrs_higgins$ the #devil# he does
whew brightening suddenly what a lark $pickering$ a safe #thing# for you $eliza_doolittle$ they wont ask you twice $eliza_doolittle$ it aint the lecturing i mind
i ll lecture them blue in the face i will and not turn a hair it making a gentleman of me that i object to
who asked him to make a gentleman of me i was happy i was free i touched pretty nigh everybody for money when i wanted it same as i touched you $henry_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$
now i am worrited tied neck and heels and everybody touches me for money it a fine #thing# for you says my solicitor
when i was a poor #man# and had a solicitor once when they found a pram in the dust cart he got me off and got shut of me and got me shut of him as quick as he could
same with the doctors used to shove me out of the hospital before i could hardly stand on my legs and nothing to pay
now they finds out that i not a healthy #man# and cant live unless they looks after me twice a day
in the house i not let do a hand turn for myself somebody else must do it and touch me for it
is it says i you mean it a good #thing# for you i says a year ago i hadnt a relative in the world except two or three that wouldnt speak to me
now i ve fifty and not a decent week wages among the lot of them i have to live for others and not for myself
that middle class morality you talk of losing $eliza_doolittle$ dont you be anxious i bet she on my doorstep by this
she that could support herself easy by selling flowers if i wasnt respectable and the next one to touch me will be you $henry_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$
i ll have to learn to speak middle class language from you instead of speaking proper english that where you ll come in and i daresay that what you done it for
$mrs_higgins$ but my dear mr $eliza_doolittle$ you need not suffer all this if you are really in earnest nobody can force you to accept this bequest
you can repudiate it isnt that so colonel $pickering$ $pickering$ i believe so $eliza_doolittle$ softening his #manner# in deference to her sex
that the tragedy of it ma am it easy to say chuck it but i havent the nerve which one of us has
we re all intimidated intimidated ma am that what we are what is there for me if i chuck it but the workhouse in my old age
if i was one of the deserving poor and had put by a bit i could chuck it but then why should i acause the deserving poor might as well be millionaires for all the happiness they ever has
but i as one of the undeserving poor have nothing between me and the pauper uniform but this here blasted three thousand a year that shoves me into the middle class
i have to dye my hair already to keep my job as a dustman they dont know what happiness is excuse the expression ma am you use it yourself if you had my provocation
they ve got you every #way# you turn it a choice between the skilly of the workhouse and the char bydis of the middle class and i havent the nerve for the workhouse
happier #man# than me will call for my dust and touch me for their tip and i ll look on helpless and envy them
intimidated that what i am broke bought up and that what your son has brought me to he is overcome by emotion mrs
$mrs_higgins$ well i very glad you re not going to do anything foolish mr $eliza_doolittle$ for this solves the problem of $eliza_doolittle$ future
you can provide for her now $eliza_doolittle$ with melancholy resignation yes ma am i expected to provide for everyone now out of three thousand a year
$mrs_higgins$ jumping up nonsense he cant provide for her he shant provide for her she doesnt belong to him i paid him five pounds for her
$eliza_doolittle$ either you re an honest #man# or a rogue $eliza_doolittle$ tolerantly a little of both $henry_higgins$ like the rest of us a little of both
$mrs_higgins$ well you took that money for the #girl# and you have no #right# to take her as well $mrs_higgins$
$henry_higgins$ dont be absurd if you really want to know where $eliza_doolittle$ is she is upstairs $mrs_higgins$ amazed upstairs then i shall jolly soon fetch her downstairs
he makes resolutely for the door $mrs_higgins$ rising and following him be quiet $henry_higgins$ sit down $mrs_higgins$ i $mrs_higgins$
sit down dear and listen to me $mrs_higgins$ oh very well very well very well he throws himself ungraciously on the ottoman with his face towards the windows
but i think you might have told me this half an hour ago $mrs_higgins$ $eliza_doolittle$ came to me this morning
she passed the night partly walking about in a rage partly trying to throw herself into the river and being afraid to and partly in the carlton hotel
she told me of the brutal #way# you two treated her $mrs_higgins$ bounding up again what $pickering$ rising also my dear $mrs_higgins$ she been telling you stories
we didnt treat her brutally we hardly said a word to her and we parted on particularly good terms turning on $mrs_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ did you bully her after i went to bed
$mrs_higgins$ just the other #way# about she threw my slippers in my face she behaved in the most outrageous #way# i never gave her the slightest provocation
the slippers came bang into my face the moment i entered the room before i had uttered a word and used perfectly awful language
$pickering$ astonished but why what did we do to her $mrs_higgins$ i think i know pretty well what you did
the #girl# is naturally rather affectionate i think isnt she mr $eliza_doolittle$ $eliza_doolittle$ very tender hearted ma am takes after me $mrs_higgins$
just so she had become attached to you both she worked very hard for you $henry_higgins$ i dont think you quite realize what anything in the nature of brain work means to a #girl# like that
well it seems that when the great day of trial came and she did this wonderful #thing# for you without making a single mistake you two sat there and never said a word to her but talked together of how glad you were that it was all over and how you had been bored with the whole #thing#
and then you were surprised because she threw your slippers at you i should have thrown the fire irons at you $mrs_higgins$
we said nothing except that we were tired and wanted to go to bed did we pick $pickering$ shrugging his shoulders
that was all $mrs_higgins$ ironically quite sure $pickering$ absolutely really that was all $mrs_higgins$ you didnt thank her or pet her or admire her or tell her how splendid she been
$mrs_higgins$ impatiently but she knew all about that we didnt make speeches to her if that what you mean $pickering$ conscience stricken
well i afraid she wont go back to wimpole street especially now that mr $eliza_doolittle$ is able to keep up the position you have thrust on her but she says she is quite willing to meet you on friendly terms and to let bygones be bygones
perhaps we were a little inconsiderate is she very angry $mrs_higgins$ returning to her place at the writing table $mrs_higgins$ furious
is she by $george$ ho $mrs_higgins$ if you promise to behave yourself $henry_higgins$ i ll ask her to come down if not go home for you have taken up quite enough of my time
$mrs_higgins$ oh all #right# very well pick you behave yourself let us put on our best sunday #manner# for this creature that we picked out of the mud
he flings himself sulkily into the elizabethan chair $eliza_doolittle$ remonstrating now now $henry_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ have some consideration for my feelings as a middle class #man#
she presses the bell button on the writing table mr $eliza_doolittle$ will you be so good as to step out on the balcony for a moment
i dont want $eliza_doolittle$ to have the shock of your news until she has made it up with these two gentlemen
$mrs_higgins$ remember your promise $henry_higgins$ would you mind $eliza_doolittle$ as you wish lady anything to help $henry_higgins$ to keep her off my hands
he disappears through the window the parlor maid answers the bell $pickering$ sits down in $eliza_doolittle$ place $mrs_higgins$ ask miss $eliza_doolittle$ to come down please
the parlor maid yes mam she goes out $mrs_higgins$ now $henry_higgins$ be good $mrs_higgins$ i am behaving myself perfectly $pickering$ he is doing his best $mrs_higgins$
a pause $mrs_higgins$ throws back his head stretches out his legs and begins to whistle $mrs_higgins$ $henry_higgins$ dearest you dont look at all nice in that attitude
$mrs_higgins$ pulling himself together i was not trying to look nice #mother# $mrs_higgins$ it doesnt matter dear i only wanted to make you speak
$mrs_higgins$ why $mrs_higgins$ because you cant speak and whistle at the same time $mrs_higgins$ groans another very trying pause $mrs_higgins$ springing up out of patience
where the #devil# is that #girl# are we to wait here all day $eliza_doolittle$ enters sunny self possessed and giving a staggeringly convincing exhibition of ease of #manner#
she carries a little work basket and is very much at home $pickering$ is too much taken aback to rise $liza$ how do you do professor $mrs_higgins$
are you quite well $mrs_higgins$ choking am i he can say no more $liza$ but of course you are you are never ill
so glad to see you again colonel $pickering$ he rises hastily and they shake hands quite chilly this morning isnt it
she sits down on his left he sits beside her $mrs_higgins$ dont you dare try this game on me i taught it to you and it doesnt take me in
$eliza_doolittle$ takes a piece of needlework from her basket and begins to stitch at it without taking the least notice of this outburst
get up and come home and dont be a fool $mrs_higgins$ very nicely put indeed $henry_higgins$ no #woman# could resist such an invitation
you will jolly soon see whether she has an idea that i havent put into her head or a word that i havent put into her mouth
i tell you i have created this #thing# out of the squashed cabbage leaves of covent garden and now she pretends to play the fine lady with me
$mrs_higgins$ you let her alone #mother# let her speak for herself $mrs_higgins$ placidly yes dear but you ll sit down wont you
$liza$ to $pickering$ taking no apparent notice of $mrs_higgins$ and working away deftly will you drop me altogether now that the experiment is over colonel $pickering$
$mrs_higgins$ sits down again savagely $pickering$ oh dont you mustnt think of it as an experiment it shocks me somehow $liza$
oh i only a squashed cabbage leaf $pickering$ impulsively no $liza$ continuing quietly but i owe so much to you that i should be very unhappy if you forgot me
$pickering$ it very kind of you to say so miss $eliza_doolittle$ $liza$ it not because you paid for my dresses i know you are generous to everybody with money
but it was from you that i learnt really nice #manner# and that is what makes one a lady isnt it
i was brought up to be just like him unable to control myself and using bad language on the slightest provocation
you see it was so very difficult for me with the example of professor $mrs_higgins$ always before me and i should never have known that ladies and gentlemen didnt behave like that if you hadnt been there
$mrs_higgins$ well $pickering$ oh that only his #way# you know he doesnt mean it $liza$ oh i didnt mean it either when i was a flower #girl#
it was only my #way# but you see i did it and that what makes the difference after all $pickering$ no doubt
still he taught you to speak and i couldnt have done that you know $liza$ trivially of course that is his profession
$mrs_higgins$ damnation $liza$ continuing it was just like learning to dance in the fashionable #way# there was nothing more than that in it
but do you know what began my real education $pickering$ what $liza$ stopping her work for a moment your calling me miss $eliza_doolittle$ that day when i first came to wimpole street
that was the beginning of self respect for me she resumes her stitching and there were a hundred little #thing# you never noticed because they came naturally to you
yes #thing# that showed you thought and felt about me as if i were something better than a scullerymaid though of course i know you would have been just the same to a scullery maid if she had been let in the drawing room
#thing# about standing up and taking off your hat and opening doors $pickering$ oh that was nothing $liza$ you never took off your boots in the dining room when i was there
$pickering$ you mustnt mind that $mrs_higgins$ takes off his boots all over the place $liza$ i know i am not blaming him
you see really and truly apart from the #thing# anyone can pick up the dressing and the proper #way# of speaking and so on the difference between a lady and a flower #girl# is not how she behaves but how she treated
i shall always be a flower #girl# to professor $mrs_higgins$ because he always treats me as a flower #girl# and always will but i know i can be a lady to you because you always treat me as a lady and always will
it is his #way# isnt it but it made such a difference to me that you didnt do it $mrs_higgins$
please dont grind your teeth $henry_higgins$ $pickering$ well this is really very nice of you miss $eliza_doolittle$ $liza$ i should like you to call me $eliza_doolittle$ now if you would
$pickering$ thank you $eliza_doolittle$ of course $liza$ and i should like professor $mrs_higgins$ to call me miss $eliza_doolittle$ $mrs_higgins$ i ll see you damned first
$mrs_higgins$ $henry_higgins$ henry $pickering$ laughing why dont you slang back at him dont stand it it would do him a lot of good
last night when i was wandering about a #girl# spoke to me and i tried to get back into the old #way# with her but it was no use
you told me you know that when a child is brought to a foreign country it picks up the language in a few weeks and forgets its own
$liza$ i cant i could have done it once but now i cant go back to it well i am a child in your country
i have forgotten my own language and can speak nothing but yours that the real break off with the corner of tottenham court road
leaving wimpole street finishes it $pickering$ much alarmed oh but you re coming back to wimpole street arent you you ll forgive $mrs_higgins$
$mrs_higgins$ rising forgive will she by $george$ let her go let her find out how she can get on without us
with a look of dignified reproach at $mrs_higgins$ he comes slowly and silently to his #daughter# who with her back to the window is unconscious of his approach
she will relapse into the gutter in three weeks without me at her elbow $eliza_doolittle$ appears at the centre window $pickering$
he incorrigible $eliza_doolittle$ you wont relapse will you $liza$ no not now never again i have learnt my lesson i dont believe i could utter one of the old sounds if i tried
$eliza_doolittle$ touches her on her left shoulder she drops her work losing her self possession utterly at the spectacle of her father splendor
a a a a a ah ow ooh $mrs_higgins$ with a crow of triumph aha just so a a a a ahowooh a a a a ahowooh a a a a ahowooh victory victory he throws himself on the divan folding his arms and spraddling arrogantly $eliza_doolittle$
can you blame the #girl# dont look at me like that $eliza_doolittle$ it aint my fault i ve come into money $liza$
you must have touched a millionaire this time dad $eliza_doolittle$ i have but i dressed something special today i going to st $george$ hanover square
your stepmother is going to marry me $liza$ angrily you re going to let yourself down to marry that low common #woman#
$pickering$ quietly he ought to $eliza_doolittle$ to $eliza_doolittle$ why has she changed her mind $eliza_doolittle$ sadly intimidated governor intimidated middle class morality claims its victim
wont you put on your hat $liza$ and come and see me turned off $liza$ if the colonel says i must i i ll almost sobbing i ll demean myself
and get insulted for my pains like enough $eliza_doolittle$ dont be afraid she never comes to words with anyone now poor #woman#
respectability has broke all the spirit out of her $pickering$ squeezing $eliza_doolittle$ elbow gently be kind to them $eliza_doolittle$ make the best of it
$liza$ forcing a little smile for him through her vexation oh well just to show there no ill feeling i ll be back in a moment
she goes out $eliza_doolittle$ sitting down beside $pickering$ i feel uncommon nervous about the ceremony colonel i wish you come and see me through it
$pickering$ but you ve been through it before #man# you were married to $eliza_doolittle$ #mother# $eliza_doolittle$ who told you that colonel $pickering$
well nobody told me but i concluded naturally $eliza_doolittle$ no that aint the natural #way# colonel it only the middle class #way#
my #way# was always the undeserving #way# but dont say nothing to $eliza_doolittle$ she dont know i always had a delicacy about telling her
$pickering$ quite #right# we ll leave it so if you dont mind $eliza_doolittle$ and you ll come to the church colonel and put me through straight
$pickering$ with pleasure as far as a bachelor can $mrs_higgins$ may i come mr $eliza_doolittle$ i should be very sorry to miss your wedding
i should indeed be honored by your condescension ma am and my poor old #woman# would take it as a tremenjous compliment
$eliza_doolittle$ she been very low thinking of the happy days that are no more $mrs_higgins$ rising i ll order the carriage and get ready
the #man# rise except $mrs_higgins$ i shant be more than fifteen minutes as she goes to the door $eliza_doolittle$ comes in hatted and buttoning her gloves
i going to the church to see your father married $eliza_doolittle$ you had better come in the brougham with me colonel $pickering$ can go on with the bridegroom
$mrs_higgins$ goes out $eliza_doolittle$ comes to the middle of the room between the centre window and the ottoman $pickering$ joins her
$eliza_doolittle$ bridegroom what a word it makes a #man# realize his position somehow he takes up his hat and goes towards the door $pickering$
before i go $eliza_doolittle$ do forgive him and come back to us $liza$ i dont think papa would allow me would you dad
$eliza_doolittle$ sad but magnanimous they played you off very cunning $eliza_doolittle$ them two sportsmen if it had been only one of them you could have nailed him
but you see there was two and one of them chaperoned the other as you might say to $pickering$ it was artful of you colonel but i bear no malice
i been the victim of one #woman# after another all my life and i dont grudge you two getting the better of $eliza_doolittle$
i should have done the same myself i shant interfere it time for us to go colonel so long $henry_higgins$
see you in st $george$ $eliza_doolittle$ he goes out $pickering$ coaxing do stay with us $eliza_doolittle$ he follows $eliza_doolittle$ $eliza_doolittle$ goes out on the balcony to avoid being alone with $mrs_higgins$
she immediately comes back into the room and makes for the door but he goes along the balcony quickly and gets his back to the door before she reaches it
he rises and joins her there $mrs_higgins$ well $eliza_doolittle$ you ve had a bit of your own back as you call it
you want me back only to pick up your slippers and put up with your tempers and fetch and carry for you
have you had enough and are you going to be reasonable or do you want any more $liza$ $mrs_higgins$ i havent said i wanted you back at all
$liza$ oh indeed then what are we talking about $mrs_higgins$ about you not about me if you come back i shall treat you just as i have always treated you
i cant change my nature and i dont intend to change my #manner# my #manner# are exactly the same as colonel $pickering$
$liza$ that not true he treats a flower #girl# as if she was a duchess $mrs_higgins$ and i treat a duchess as if she was a flower #girl#
$liza$ i see she turns away composedly and sits on the ottoman facing the window the same to everybody $mrs_higgins$ just so
without accepting the comparison at all points $eliza_doolittle$ it quite true that your father is not a snob and that he will be quite at home in any station of life to which his eccentric destiny may call him
seriously the great secret $eliza_doolittle$ is not having bad #manner# or good #manner# or any other particular sort of #manner# but having the same #manner# for all human souls in short behaving as if you were in heaven where there are no third class carriages and one soul is as good as another
$liza$ like father $mrs_higgins$ grinning a little taken down $liza$ amen you are a born preacher $mrs_higgins$ irritated the question is not whether i treat you rudely but whether you ever heard me treat anyone else better
$liza$ with sudden sincerity i dont care how you treat me i dont mind your swearing at me i dont mind a black eye i ve had one before this
but standing up and facing him i wont be passed over $mrs_higgins$ then get out of my #way# for i wont stop for you
you talk about me as if i were a motor bus $liza$ so you are a motor bus all bounce and go and no consideration for anyone
but i can do without you dont think i cant $mrs_higgins$ i know you can i told you you could $liza$ wounded getting away from him to the other side of the ottoman with her face to the hearth
i know you did you brute you wanted to get rid of me $mrs_higgins$ liar $liza$ thank you she sits down with dignity $mrs_higgins$
you never asked yourself i suppose whether i could do without you $liza$ earnestly dont you try to get round me
you ll have to do without me $mrs_higgins$ arrogant i can do without anybody i have my own soul my own spark of divine fire
he sits down near her on the ottoman i have learnt something from your idiotic notions i confess that humbly and gratefully
but with sudden humility i shall miss you $eliza_doolittle$ and i have grown accustomed to your voice and appearance i like them rather
$liza$ well you have both of them on your gramophone and in your book of photographs when you feel lonely without me you can turn the machine on
it got no feelings to hurt $mrs_higgins$ i cant turn your soul on leave me those feelings and you can take away the voice and the face
they are not you $liza$ oh you are a #devil# you can twist the heart in a #girl# as easy as some could twist her arms to hurt her
$mrs_pearce$ warned me time and again she has wanted to leave you and you always got round her at the last minute
i care for life for humanity and you are a part of it that has come my #way# and been built into my house
and you dont care a bit for her and you dont care a bit for me $mrs_higgins$ what more can you or anyone ask
$liza$ i wont care for anybody that doesnt care for me $mrs_higgins$ commercial principles $eliza_doolittle$ like reproducing her covent garden pronunciation with professional exactness yollin voylets selling violets isnt it
$liza$ dont sneer at me it mean to sneer at me $mrs_higgins$ i have never sneered in my life sneering doesnt become either the human face or the human soul
you call me a brute because you couldnt buy a claim on me by fetching my slippers and finding my spectacles
you were a fool i think a #woman# fetching a #man# slippers is a disgusting sight did i ever fetch your slippers
i am expressing my righteous contempt for commercialism i dont and wont trade in affection i think a good deal more of you for throwing them in my face
no use slaving for me and then saying you want to be cared for who cares for a slave if you come back come back for the sake of good fellowship for you ll get nothing else
you ve had a thousand times as much out of me as i have out of you and if you dare to set up your little dog tricks of fetching and carrying slippers against my creation of a duchess $eliza_doolittle$ i ll slam the door in your silly face
$liza$ what did you do it for if you didnt care for me $mrs_higgins$ heartily why because it was my job
$liza$ you never thought of the trouble it would make for me $mrs_higgins$ would the world ever have been made if its maker had been afraid of making trouble
making life means making trouble there only one #way# of escaping trouble and that killing #thing# cowards you notice are always shrieking to have troublesome people killed
$liza$ i no preacher i dont notice #thing# like that i notice that you dont notice me $mrs_higgins$ jumping up and walking about intolerantly
once for all understand that i go my #way# and do my work without caring twopence what happens to either of us
$eliza_doolittle$ you re an idiot i waste the treasures of my miltonic mind by spreading them before you i am not intimidated like your father and your stepmother
so you can come back or go to the #devil# which you please $liza$ what am i to come back for
$mrs_higgins$ bouncing up on his knees on the ottoman and leaning over it to her for the fun of it that why i took you on
$liza$ with averted face and you may throw me out tomorrow if i dont do everything you want me to $mrs_higgins$
yes and you may walk out tomorrow if i dont do everything you want me to $liza$ and live with my stepmother
$mrs_higgins$ yes or sell flowers $liza$ oh if i only could go back to my flower basket i should be independent of both you and father and all the world
why did you take my independence from me why did i give it up i a slave now for all my fine clothes
$mrs_higgins$ not a bit i ll adopt you as my #daughter# and settle money on you if you like or would you rather marry $pickering$
$liza$ looking fiercely round at him i wouldnt marry you if you asked me and you re nearer my age than what he is
$mrs_higgins$ gently than he is not than what he is $liza$ losing her temper and rising i ll talk as i like
you re not my teacher now $mrs_higgins$ reflectively i dont suppose $pickering$ would though he as confirmed an old bachelor as i am
$liza$ that not what i want and dont you think it i ve always had chaps enough wanting me that #way# $freddy$ hill writes to me twice and three times a day sheets and sheets
$mrs_higgins$ disagreeably surprised damn his impudence he recoils and finds himself sitting on his heels $liza$ he has a #right# to if he likes poor lad
and he does love me $mrs_higgins$ getting off the ottoman you have no #right# to encourage him $liza$ every #girl# has a #right# to be loved
and if he weak and poor and wants me may be he make me happier than my betters that bully me and dont want me
$mrs_higgins$ what by fools like that $liza$ $freddy$ not a fool $mrs_higgins$ can he make anything of you that the point
$liza$ perhaps i could make something of him but i never thought of us making anything of one another and you never think of anything else
i only want to be natural $mrs_higgins$ in short you want me to be as infatuated about you as $freddy$ is that it
$liza$ no i dont that not the sort of feeling i want from you and dont you be too sure of yourself or of me
i could have been a bad #girl# if i liked i ve seen more of some #thing# than you for all your learning
#girl# like me can drag gentlemen down to make love to them easy enough and they wish each other dead the next minute
$mrs_higgins$ of course they do then what in thunder are we quarrelling about $liza$ much troubled i want a little kindness
what i done correcting herself what i did was not for the dresses and the taxis i did it because we were pleasant together
and i come came to care for you not to want you to make love to me and not forgetting the difference between us but more friendly like
i know i a common ignorant #girl# and you a book learned gentleman but i not dirt under your feet $mrs_higgins$ well of course
that just how i feel and how $pickering$ feels $eliza_doolittle$ you re a fool $liza$ that not a proper answer to give me
she sinks on the chair at the writing table in tears $mrs_higgins$ it all you ll get until you stop being a common idiot
if you re going to be a lady you ll have to give up feeling neglected if the #man# you know dont spend half their time snivelling over you and the other half giving you black eyes
if you cant stand the coldness of my sort of life and the strain of it go back to the gutter
work til you are more a brute than a human being and then cuddle and squabble and drink til you fall asleep
it violent you can feel it through the thickest skin you can taste it and smell it without any training or any work
oh it a fine life the life of the gutter it real it warm not like science and literature and classical music and philosophy and art
you find me cold unfeeling selfish dont you very well be off with you to the sort of people you like
marry some sentimental hog or other with lots of money and a thick pair of lips to kiss you with and a thick pair of boots to kick you with
if you cant appreciate what you ve got you better get what you can appreciate $liza$ desperate oh you are a cruel tyrant
i cant talk to you you turn everything against me i always in the wrong but you know very well all the time that you re nothing but a bully
you know i cant go back to the gutter as you call it and that i have no real friends in the world but you and the colonel
you know well i couldnt bear to live with a low common #man# after you two and it wicked and cruel of you to insult me by pretending i could
you think i must go back to wimpole street because i have nowhere else to go but father but dont you be too sure that you have me under your feet to be trampled on and talked down
i ll marry $freddy$ i will as soon as he able to support me $mrs_higgins$ sitting down beside her rubbish you shall marry an ambassador
you shall marry the governor general of india or the lord lieutenant of ireland or somebody who wants a deputy queen i not going to have my masterpiece thrown away on $freddy$
but i havent forgot what you said a minute ago and i wont be coaxed round as if i was a baby or a puppy
$liza$ you think i like you to say that if i cant have kindness i ll have independence $mrs_higgins$ independence that middle class blasphemy
we are all dependent on one another every soul of us on earth $liza$ rising determinedly i ll let you see whether i dependent on you
if you can preach i can teach i ll go and be a teacher $mrs_higgins$ what ll you teach in heaven name $liza$
what you taught me i ll teach #phonetic# $mrs_higgins$ ha ha ha $liza$ i ll offer myself as an assistant to professor nepean
$mrs_higgins$ rising in a fury what that impostor that humbug that toadying ignoramus teach him my methods my discoveries you take one step in his direction and i ll wring your neck
he lays hands on her do you hear $liza$ defiantly non resistant wring away what do i care i knew you strike me some day
he lets her go stamping with rage at having forgotten himself and recoils so hastily that he stumbles back into his seat on the ottoman aha
now i know how to deal with you what a fool i was not to think of it before you cant take away the knowledge you gave me
you said i had a finer ear than you and i can be civil and kind to people which is more than you can
aha that done you $henry_higgins$ $mrs_higgins$ it has now i dont care that snapping her fingers for your bullying and your big talk
i ll advertize it in the papers that your duchess is only a flower #girl# that you taught and that she ll teach anybody to be a duchess just the same in six months for a thousand guineas
oh when i think of myself crawling under your feet and being trampled on and called names when all the time i had only to lift up my finger to be as good as you i could just kick myself
$mrs_higgins$ wondering at her you damned impudent slut you but it better than snivelling better than fetching slippers and finding spectacles isnt it
rising by $george$ $eliza_doolittle$ i said i make a #woman# of you and i have i like you like this $liza$
yes you turn round and make up to me now that i not afraid of you and can do without you
$mrs_higgins$ of course i do you little fool five minutes ago you were like a millstone round my neck now you re a tower of strength a consort battleship
you and i and $pickering$ will be three old bachelors together instead of only two #man# and a silly #girl# $mrs_higgins$ returns dressed for the wedding
$eliza_doolittle$ instantly becomes cool and elegant $mrs_higgins$ the carriage is waiting $eliza_doolittle$ are you ready $liza$ quite is the professor coming
$mrs_higgins$ certainly not he cant behave himself in church he makes remarks out loud all the time on the clergyman pronunciation
$liza$ then i shall not see you again professor good bye she goes to the door $mrs_higgins$ coming to $mrs_higgins$
he is about to kiss her when he recollects something oh by the #way# $eliza_doolittle$ order a ham and a stilton cheese will you
and buy me a pair of reindeer gloves number eights and a tie to match that new suit of mine at eale binman
good bye dear $mrs_higgins$ good bye #mother# you can choose the color his cheerful careless vigorous voice shows that he is incorrigible $liza$ disdainfully
buy them yourself she sweeps out $mrs_higgins$ i afraid you ve spoiled that #girl# $henry_higgins$ but never mind dear i ll buy you the tie and gloves
$mrs_higgins$ sunnily oh dont bother she ll buy em all #right# enough good bye they kiss $mrs_higgins$ runs out $mrs_higgins$ left alone rattles his cash in his pocket chuckles and disports himself in a highly self satisfied #manner#
the rest of the story need not be shown in action and indeed would hardly need telling if our imaginations were not so enfeebled by their lazy dependence on the ready makes and reach me downs of the ragshop in which romance keeps its stock of happy endings to misfit all stories
now the history of $eliza_doolittle$ though called a romance because of the transfiguration it records seems exceedingly improbable is common enough
such transfigurations have been achieved by hundreds of resolutely ambitious young #woman# since nell gwynne set them the example by playing queens and fascinating kings in the theatre in which she began by selling oranges
nevertheless people in all directions have assumed for no other reason than that she became the heroine of a romance that she must have married the hero of it
this is unbearable not only because her little drama if acted on such a thoughtless assumption must be spoiled but because the true sequel is patent to anyone with a sense of human nature in general and of feminine instinct in particular
$eliza_doolittle$ in telling $mrs_higgins$ she would not marry him if he asked her was not coquetting she was announcing a well considered decision
when a bachelor interests and dominates and teaches and becomes important to a spinster as $mrs_higgins$ with $eliza_doolittle$ she always if she has #character# enough to be capable of it considers very seriously indeed whether she will play for becoming that bachelor wife especially if he is so little interested in marriage that a determined and devoted #woman# might capture him if she set herself resolutely to do it
her decision will depend a good deal on whether she is really free to choose and that again will depend on her age and income
if she is at the end of her youth and has no security for her livelihood she will marry him because she must marry anybody who will provide for her
but at $eliza_doolittle$ age a good looking #girl# does not feel that pressure she feels free to pick and choose
she is therefore guided by her instinct in the matter $eliza_doolittle$ instinct tells her not to marry $mrs_higgins$ it does not tell her to give him up
it is not in the slightest doubt as to his remaining one of the strongest personal interests in her life it would be very sorely strained if there was another #woman# likely to supplant her with him
but as she feels sure of him on that last point she has no doubt at all as to her course and would not have any even if the difference of twenty years in age which seems so great to youth did not exist between them
as our own instincts are not appealed to by her conclusion let us see whether we cannot discover some reason in it
when $mrs_higgins$ excused his indifference to young #woman# on the ground that they had an irresistible rival in his #mother# he gave the clue to his inveterate old bachelordom
if an imaginative boy has a sufficiently rich #mother# who has intelligence personal grace dignity of #character# without harshness and a cultivated sense of the best art of her time to enable her to make her house beautiful she sets a standard for him against which very few #woman# can struggle besides effecting for him a disengagement of his affections his sense of beauty and his idealism from his specifically sexual impulses
this makes him a standing puzzle to the huge number of uncultivated people who have been brought up in tasteless homes by commonplace or disagreeable parents and to whom consequently literature painting sculpture music and affectionate personal relations come as modes of sex if they come at all
the word passion means nothing else to them and that $mrs_higgins$ could have a passion for #phonetic# and idealize his #mother# instead of $eliza_doolittle$ would seem to them absurd and unnatural
nevertheless when we look round and see that hardly anyone is too ugly or disagreeable to find a wife or a husband if he or she wants one whilst many old maids and bachelors are above the average in quality and culture we cannot help suspecting that the disentanglement of sex from the associations with which it is so commonly confused a disentanglement which persons of genius achieve by sheer intellectual analysis is sometimes produced or aided by parental fascination
now though $eliza_doolittle$ was incapable of thus explaining to herself $mrs_higgins$ formidable powers of resistance to the charm that prostrated $freddy$ at the first glance she was instinctively aware that she could never obtain a complete grip of him or come between him and his #mother# the first necessity of the married #woman#
to put it shortly she knew that for some mysterious reason he had not the makings of a married #man# in him according to her conception of a husband as one to whom she would be his nearest and fondest and warmest interest
even had there been no #mother# rival she would still have refused to accept an interest in herself that was secondary to philosophic interests
the case is uncommon only to the extent that remarkable #mother# are uncommon had $mrs_higgins$ died there would still have been milton and the universal alphabet
landor remark that to those who have the greatest power of loving love is a secondary affair would not have recommended landor to $eliza_doolittle$
put that along with her resentment of $mrs_higgins$ domineering superiority and her mistrust of his coaxing cleverness in getting round her and evading her wrath when he had gone too far with his impetuous bullying and you will see that $eliza_doolittle$ instinct had good grounds for warning her not to marry her pygmalion
and now whom did $eliza_doolittle$ marry for if $mrs_higgins$ was a predestinate old bachelor she was most certainly not a predestinate old maid
well that can be told very shortly to those who have not guessed it from the indications she has herself given them
almost immediately after $eliza_doolittle$ is stung into proclaiming her considered determination not to marry $mrs_higgins$ she mentions the fact that young mr frederick eynsford hill is pouring out his love for her daily through the post
now $freddy$ is young practically twenty years younger than $mrs_higgins$ he is a gentleman or as $eliza_doolittle$ would qualify him a toff and speaks like one he is nicely dressed is treated by the colonel as an equal loves her unaffectedly and is not her master nor ever likely to dominate her in spite of his advantage of social standing
$eliza_doolittle$ has no use for the foolish romantic tradition that all #woman# love to be mastered if not actually bullied and beaten
sensible despots have never confined that precaution to #woman# they have taken their whips with them when they have dealt with #man# and been slavishly idealized by the #man# over whom they have flourished the whip much more than by #woman#
no doubt there are slavish #woman# as well as slavish #man# and #woman# like #man# admire those that are stronger than themselves
when you go to #woman# says nietzsche take your whip with you but to admire a strong person and to live under that strong person thumb are two different #thing#
the weak may not be admired and hero worshipped but they are by no means disliked or shunned and they never seem to have the least difficulty in marrying people who are too good for them
they may fail in emergencies but life is not one long emergency it is mostly a string of situations for which no exceptional strength is needed and with which even rather weak people can cope if they have a stronger partner to help them out
accordingly it is a truth everywhere in evidence that strong people masculine or feminine not only do not marry stronger people but do not show any preference for them in selecting their friends
when a lion meets another with a louder roar the first lion thinks the last a bore the #man# or #woman# who feels strong enough for two seeks for every other quality in a partner than strength
weak people want to marry strong people who do not frighten them too much and this often leads them to make the mistake we describe metaphorically as biting off more than they can chew
they want too much for too little and when the bargain is unreasonable beyond all bearing the union becomes impossible it ends in the weaker party being either discarded or borne as a cross which is worse
the converse is also true people who are not only weak but silly or obtuse as well are often in these difficulties
this being the state of human affairs what is $eliza_doolittle$ fairly sure to do when she is placed between $freddy$ and $mrs_higgins$
will she look forward to a lifetime of fetching $mrs_higgins$ slippers or to a lifetime of $freddy$ fetching hers there can be no doubt about the answer
unless $freddy$ is biologically repulsive to her and $mrs_higgins$ biologically attractive to a degree that overwhelms all her other instincts she will if she marries either of them marry $freddy$
and that is just what $eliza_doolittle$ did complications ensued but they were economic not romantic $freddy$ had no money and no occupation
his #mother# jointure a last relic of the opulence of largelady park had enabled her to struggle along in earlscourt with an air of gentility but not to procure any serious secondary education for her children much less give the boy a profession
a clerkship at thirty shillings a week was beneath $freddy$ dignity and extremely distasteful to him besides his prospects consisted of a hope that if he kept up appearances somebody would do something for him
to his #mother# it perhaps appeared as a marriage to some lady of means who could not resist her boy niceness
the something appeared vaguely to his imagination as a private secretaryship or a sinecure of some sort fancy her feelings when he married a flower #girl# who had become declassee under extraordinary circumstances which were now notorious
her father though formerly a dustman and now fantastically disclassed had become extremely popular in the smartest society by a social talent which triumphed over every prejudice and every disadvantage
rejected by the middle class which he loathed he had shot up at once into the highest circles by his wit his dustmanship which he carried like a banner and his nietzschean transcendence of good and evil
at intimate ducal dinners he sat on the #right# hand of the duchess and in country houses he smoked in the pantry and was made much of by the butler when he was not feeding in the dining room and being consulted by cabinet ministers
but he found it almost as hard to do all this on four thousand a year as mrs eynsford hill to live in earlscourt on an income so pitiably smaller that i have not the heart to disclose its exact figure
it is true that $eliza_doolittle$ situation did not seem wholly ineligible he absolutely refused to add the last straw to his burden by contributing to $eliza_doolittle$ support
thus $freddy$ and $eliza_doolittle$ now mr and mrs eynsford hill would have spent a penniless honeymoon but for a wedding present of pounds from the colonel to $eliza_doolittle$
it lasted a long time because $freddy$ did not know how to spend money never having had any to spend and $eliza_doolittle$ socially trained by a pair of old bachelors wore her clothes as long as they held together and looked pretty without the least regard to their being many months out of fashion
still pounds will not last two young people for ever and they both knew and $eliza_doolittle$ felt as well that they must shift for themselves in the end
she could quarter herself on wimpole street because it had come to be her home but she was quite aware that she ought not to quarter $freddy$ there and that it would not be good for his #character# if she did
not that the wimpole street bachelors objected when she consulted them $mrs_higgins$ declined to be bothered about her housing problem when that solution was so simple
$eliza_doolittle$ desire to have $freddy$ in the house with her seemed of no more importance than if she had wanted an extra piece of bedroom furniture
he denied that $freddy$ had any #character# and declared that if he tried to do any useful work some competent person would have the trouble of undoing it a procedure involving a net loss to the community and great unhappiness to $freddy$ himself who was obviously intended by nature for such light work as amusing $eliza_doolittle$ which $mrs_higgins$ declared was a much more useful and honorable occupation than working in the city
when $eliza_doolittle$ referred again to her project of teaching #phonetic# $mrs_higgins$ abated not a jot of his violent opposition to it
he said she was not within ten years of being qualified to meddle with his pet subject and as it was evident that the colonel agreed with him she felt she could not go against them in this grave matter and that she had no #right# without $mrs_higgins$ consent to exploit the knowledge he had given her for his knowledge seemed to her as much his private property as his watch
pleas as to $freddy$ #character# and the moral obligation on him to earn his own living were lost on $mrs_higgins$ $eliza_doolittle$ was no communist
besides she was superstitiously devoted to them both more entirely and frankly after her marriage than before it it was the colonel who finally solved the problem which had cost him much perplexed cogitation
she replied that she had thought of it but had put it out of her head because the colonel had said that day at $mrs_higgins$ that it would never do
the colonel confessed that when he said that he had not quite recovered from the dazzling impression of the day before
he one day asked $eliza_doolittle$ rather shyly whether she had quite given up her notion of keeping a flower shop they broke the matter to $mrs_higgins$ that evening
the sole comment vouchsafed by him very nearly led to a serious quarrel with $eliza_doolittle$ it was to the effect that she would have in $freddy$ an ideal errand boy
he said he had been thinking of a shop himself though it had presented itself to his pennilessness as a small place in which $eliza_doolittle$ should sell tobacco at one counter whilst he sold newspapers at the opposite one
but he agreed that it would be extraordinarily jolly to go early every morning with $eliza_doolittle$ to covent garden and buy flowers on the scene of their first meeting
he added that he had always been afraid to propose anything of the sort because $clara$ would make an awful row about a step that must damage her matrimonial chances and his #mother# could not be expected to like it after clinging for so many years to that step of the social ladder on which retail trade is impossible
$freddy$ himself was next sounded on the subject a sentiment which earned him many kisses from his wife this difficulty was removed by an event highly unexpected by $freddy$ #mother#
$clara$ in the course of her incursions into those artistic circles which were the highest within her reach discovered that her conversational qualifications were expected to include a grounding in the novels of mr g wells
she borrowed them in various directions so energetically that she swallowed them all within two months the result was a conversion of a kind quite common today
poor $clara$ who appeared to $mrs_higgins$ and his #mother# as a disagreeable and ridiculous person and to her own #mother# as in some inexplicable #way# a social failure had never seen herself in either light for though to some extent ridiculed and mimicked in west kensington like everybody else there she was accepted as a rational and normal or shall we say inevitable sort of human being
at worst they called her the pusher but to them no more than to herself had it ever occurred that she was pushing the air and pushing it in a wrong direction
a modern acts of the apostles would fill fifty whole bibles if anyone were capable of writing it still she was not happy
her one asset the fact that her #mother# was what the epsom greengrocer called a carriage lady had no exchange value apparently
it had prevented her from getting educated because the only education she could have afforded was education with the earlscourt green grocer #daughter#
it had led her to seek the society of her #mother# class and that class simply would not have her because she was much poorer than the greengrocer and far from being able to afford a maid could not afford even a housemaid and had to scrape along at home with an illiberally treated general servant
she was growing desperate under such circumstances nothing could give her an air of being a genuine product of largelady park
and yet its tradition made her regard a marriage with anyone within her reach as an unbearable humiliation commercial people and professional people in a small #way# were odious to her
she ran after painters and novelists but she did not charm them and her bold attempts to pick up and practise artistic and literary talk irritated them
she was in short an utter failure an ignorant incompetent pretentious unwelcome penniless useless little snob and though she did not admit these disqualifications for nobody ever faces unpleasant truths of this kind until the possibility of a #way# out dawns on them
$clara$ had a startling eyeopener when on being suddenly wakened to enthusiasm by a #girl# of her own age who dazzled her and produced in her a gushing desire to take her for a model and gain her friendship she discovered that this exquisite apparition had graduated from the gutter in a few months time
it shook her so violently that when mr g wells lifted her on the point of his puissant pen and placed her at the angle of view from which the life she was leading and the society to which she clung appeared in its true relation to real human needs and worthy social structure he effected a conversion and a conviction of sin comparable to the most sensational feats of general booth or gypsy smith
she felt their effects too keenly to be satisfied with her position $clara$ snobbery went bang life suddenly began to move with her
some of the acquaintances to whom she had been a tedious or indifferent or ridiculous affliction dropped her others became cordial
to her amazement she found that some quite nice people were saturated with wells and that this accessibility to ideas was the secret of their niceness
people she had thought deeply religious and had tried to conciliate on that tack with disastrous results suddenly took an interest in her and revealed a hostility to conventional religion which she had never conceived possible except among the most desperate #character#
without knowing how or why she began to make friends and enemies they made her read galsworthy and galsworthy exposed the vanity of largelady park and finished her
it exasperated her to think that the dungeon in which she had languished for so many unhappy years had been unlocked all the time and that the impulses she had so carefully struggled with and stifled for the sake of keeping well with society were precisely those by which alone she could have come into any sort of sincere human contact
in the radiance of these discoveries and the tumult of their reaction she made a fool of herself as freely and conspicuously as when she so rashly adopted $eliza_doolittle$ expletive in $mrs_higgins$ drawing room for the new born wellsian had to find her bearings almost as ridiculously as a baby but nobody hates a baby for its ineptitudes or thinks the worse of it for trying to eat the matches and $clara$ lost no friends by her follies
they laughed at her to her face this time and she had to defend herself and fight it out as best she could
when $freddy$ paid a visit to earlscourt which he never did when he could possibly help it to make the desolating announcement that he and his $eliza_doolittle$ were thinking of blackening the largelady scutcheon by opening a shop he found the little household already convulsed by a prior announcement from $clara$ that she also was going to work in an old furniture shop in dover street which had been started by a fellow wellsian
she had made up her mind that cost what it might she would see mr wells in the flesh and she had achieved her end at a garden party
this appointment $clara$ owed after all to her old social accomplishment of push she had better luck than so rash an enterprise deserved
mr wells came up to her expectations age had not withered him nor could custom stale his infinite variety in half an hour
his pleasant neatness and compactness his small hands and feet his teeming ready brain his unaffected accessibility and a certain fine apprehensiveness which stamped him as susceptible from his topmost hair to his tipmost toe proved irresistible
and as she happened to talk to the lady of the furniture shop and that lady also desired above all #thing# to know mr wells and sell pretty #thing# to him she offered $clara$ a job on the chance of achieving that end through her
$clara$ talked of nothing else for weeks and weeks afterwards and so it came about that $eliza_doolittle$ luck held and the expected opposition to the flower shop melted away
the shop is in the arcade of a railway station not very far from the victoria and albert museum and if you live in that neighborhood you may go there any day and buy a buttonhole from $eliza_doolittle$
would you not like to be assured that the shop was an immense success thanks to $eliza_doolittle$ charms and her early business experience in covent garden
the truth is the truth the shop did not pay for a long time simply because $eliza_doolittle$ and her $freddy$ did not know how to keep it
true $eliza_doolittle$ had not to begin at the very beginning she knew the names and prices of the cheaper flowers and her elation was unbounded when she found that $freddy$ like all youths educated at cheap pretentious and thoroughly inefficient schools knew a little latin
it was very little but enough to make him appear to her a porson or bentley and to put him at his ease with botanical nomenclature
unfortunately he knew nothing else and $eliza_doolittle$ though she could count money up to eighteen shillings or so and had acquired a certain familiarity with the language of milton from her struggles to qualify herself for winning $mrs_higgins$ bet could not write out a bill without utterly disgracing the establishment
$freddy$ power of stating in latin that balbus built a wall and that gaul was divided into three parts did not carry with it the slightest knowledge of accounts or business
now here is a last opportunity for romance alas colonel $pickering$ had to explain to him what a cheque book and a bank account meant
$freddy$ backed up $eliza_doolittle$ in her obstinate refusal to believe that they could save money by engaging a bookkeeper with some knowledge of the business
how they argued could you possibly save money by going to extra expense when you already could not make both ends meet
but the colonel after making the ends meet over and over again at last gently insisted and $eliza_doolittle$ humbled to the dust by having to beg from him so often and stung by the uproarious derision of $mrs_higgins$ to whom the notion of $freddy$ succeeding at anything was a joke that never palled grasped the fact that business like #phonetic# has to be learned
on the piteous spectacle of the pair spending their evenings in shorthand schools and polytechnic classes learning bookkeeping and typewriting with incipient junior clerks male and female from the elementary schools let me not dwell
there were even classes at the london school of economics and a humble personal appeal to the director of that institution to recommend a course bearing on the flower business
he being a humorist explained to them the method of the celebrated dickensian essay on chinese metaphysics by the gentleman who read an article on china and an article on metaphysics and combined the information
and the pair were by no means easily teachable he suggested that they should combine the london school with kew gardens
$eliza_doolittle$ to whom the procedure of the dickensian gentleman seemed perfectly correct as in fact it was and not in the least funny which was only her ignorance took his advice with entire gravity
but the effort that cost her the deepest humiliation was a request to $mrs_higgins$ whose pet artistic fancy next to milton verse was calligraphy and who himself wrote a most beautiful italian hand that he would teach her to write
he declared that she was congenitally incapable of forming a single letter worthy of the least of milton words but she persisted and again he suddenly threw himself into the task of teaching her with a combination of stormy intensity concentrated patience and occasional bursts of interesting disquisition on the beauty and nobility the august mission and destiny of human handwriting
$eliza_doolittle$ ended by acquiring an extremely uncommercial script which was a positive extension of her personal beauty and spending three times as much on stationery as anyone else because certain qualities and shapes of paper became indispensable to her
she could not even address an envelope in the usual #way# because it made the margins all wrong their commercial school days were a period of disgrace and despair for the young couple
at last they gave it up as hopeless and shook the dust of the shorthand schools and the polytechnics and the london school of economics from their feet for ever
they seemed to be learning nothing about flower shops besides the business was in some mysterious #way# beginning to take care of itself
they came to the conclusion that their own #way# was the best and that they had really a remarkable talent for business
the colonel who had been compelled for some years to keep a sufficient sum on current account at his bankers to make up their deficits found that the provision was unnecessary the young people were prospering
they had somehow forgotten their objections to employing other people it is true that there was not quite fair play between them and their competitors in trade
their week ends in the country cost them nothing and saved them the price of their sunday dinners for the motor car was the colonel and he and $mrs_higgins$ paid the hotel bills
mr hill florist and greengrocer they soon discovered that there was money in asparagus and asparagus led to other vegetables had an air which stamped the business as classy and in private life he was still frederick eynsford hill esquire
not that there was any swank about him nobody but $eliza_doolittle$ knew that he had been christened frederick challoner $eliza_doolittle$ herself swanked like anything
it is astonishing how much $eliza_doolittle$ still manages to meddle in the housekeeping at wimpole street in spite of the shop and her own family
and it is notable that though she never nags her husband and frankly loves the colonel as if she were his favorite #daughter# she has never got out of the habit of nagging $mrs_higgins$ that was established on the fatal night when she won his bet for him
that is all that is how it has turned out she snaps his head off on the faintest provocation or on none
he storms and bullies and derides but she stands up to him so ruthlessly that the colonel has to ask her from time to time to be kinder to $mrs_higgins$ and it is the only request of his that brings a mulish expression into her face
nothing but some emergency or calamity great enough to break down all likes and dislikes and throw them both back on their common humanity and may they be spared any such trial will
he no longer dares to tease her by assuming an abysmal inferiority of $freddy$ mind to his own ever alter this
the very scrupulousness with which he told her that day that he had become used to having her there and dependent on her for all sorts of little services and that he should miss her if she went away it would never have occurred to $freddy$ or the colonel to say anything of the sort deepens her inner certainty that she is no more to him than them slippers yet she has a sense too that his indifference is deeper than the infatuation of commoner souls
she knows that $mrs_higgins$ does not need her just as her father did not need her she is immensely interested in him
she has even secret mischievous moments in which she wishes she could get him alone on a desert island away from all ties and with nobody else in the world to consider and just drag him off his pedestal and see him making love like any common #man#
but when it comes to business to the life that she really leads as distinguished from the life of dreams and fancies she likes $freddy$ and she likes the colonel and she does not like $mrs_higgins$ and mr $eliza_doolittle$
we all have private imaginations of that sort galatea never does quite like pygmalion his relation to her is too godlike to be altogether agreeable
