the intense interest aroused in the public by what was known at the time as the styles case has now somewhat subsided
nevertheless in view of the world wide notoriety which attended it i have been asked both by my friend hercule_poirot and the family themselves to write an account of the whole story
hercule_poirot explains chapter i i go to styles this we trust will effectually silence the sensational rumours which still persist i will therefore briefly set down the circumstances which led to my being connected with the affair
i had been invalided home from the front and after spending some months in a rather depressing convalescent home was given a month sick leave
having no near relations or friend i was trying to make up my mind what to do when i ran across mr_john_cavendish
i had seen very little of him for some year indeed i had never known him particularly well he was a good fifteen year my senior for one thing though he hardly looked his forty five year
we had a good yarn about old time and it ended in his inviting me down to styles to spend my leave there
as a boy though i had often stayed at styles his mother place in essex the mater will be delighted to see you again after all those year he added
your mother keeps well i asked oh yes i suppose you know that she has married again
mrs mr_john_cavendish who had married mr_john_cavendish father when he was a widower with two sons had been a handsome woman of middle age as i remembered her
i recalled her as an energetic autocratic personality somewhat inclined to charitable and social notoriety with a fondness for opening bazaars and playing the lady bountiful
i am afraid i showed my surprise rather plainly she certainly could not be a day less than seventy now she was a most generous woman and possessed a considerable fortune of her own
he had been completely under his wife ascendancy so much so that on dying he left the place to her for her lifetime as well as the larger part of his income
their country place styles court had been purchased by mr_john_cavendish early in their married life an arrangement that was distinctly unfair to his two sons
their step mother however had always been most generous to them indeed they were so young at the time of their father remarriage that they always thought of her as their own mother
he had qualified as a doctor but early relinquished the profession of medicine and lived at home while pursuing literary ambitions though his verses never had any marked success
mr_john_cavendish practiced for some time as a barrister but had finally settled down to the more congenial life of a country squire
he had married two year ago and had taken his wife to live at styles though i entertained a shrewd suspicion that he would have preferred his mother to increase his allowance which would have enabled him to have a home of his own
mrs mr_john_cavendish however was a lady who liked to make her own plans and expected other people to fall in with them and in this case she certainly had the whip hand namely the purse strings
monsieur_lawrence the younger had been a delicate youth mr_john_cavendish noticed my surprise at the news of his mother remarriage and smiled rather ruefully
rotten little bounder too he said savagely i can tell you mr_hastings it making life jolly difficult for us
as for evie you remember evie no oh i suppose she was after your time she the mater factotum companion jack of all trades
a great sport old evie not precisely young and beautiful but as game as they make them you were going to say
he turned up from nowhere on the pretext of being a second cousin or something of evie though she didnt seem particularly keen to acknowledge the relationship
oh this fellow the fellow is an absolute outsider anyone can see that he got a great black beard and wears patent leather boots in all weathers
but the mater cottoned to him at once took him on as secretary you know how she always running a hundred societies
i nodded well of course the war has turned the hundreds into thousands no doubt the fellow was very useful to her
but you could have knocked us all down with a feather when three months ago she suddenly announced that she and mr_alfred_inglethorp were engaged
the fellow must be at least twenty year younger than she is it simply bare faced fortune hunting but there you are she is her own mistress and she married him
thus it came about that three day later i descended from the train at styles st mary_cavendish an absurd little station with no apparent reason for existence perched up in the midst of green fields and country lanes
it must be a difficult situation for you all difficult it damnable mr_john_cavendish was waiting on the platform and piloted me out to the car
the village of styles st mary_cavendish was situated about two miles from the little station and styles court lay a mile the other side of it
got a drop or two of petrol still you see he remarked mainly owing to the mater activities it was a still warm day in early july
as one looked out over the flat essex country lying so green and peaceful under the afternoon sun it seemed almost impossible to believe that not so very far away a great war was running its appointed course
i felt i had suddenly strayed into another world as we turned in at the lodge gates mr_john_cavendish said i afraid you ll find it very quiet down here mr_hastings
my dear fellow that just what i want oh it pleasant enough if you want to lead the idle life
i drill with the volunteers twice a week and lend a hand at the farms my wife works regularly on the land
she is up at five every morning to milk and keeps at it steadily until lunchtime it a jolly good life taking it all round if it werent for that fellow mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp
he checked the car suddenly and glanced at his watch i wonder if we ve time to pick up mademoiselle_cynthia no she ll have started from the hospital by now
no mademoiselle_cynthia is a protegee of my mother the daughter of an old schoolfellow of hers who married a rascally solicitor
mademoiselle_cynthia that not your wife he came a cropper and the girl was left an orphan and penniless my mother came to the rescue and mademoiselle_cynthia has been with us nearly two year now
she works in the red cross hospital at tadminster seven miles away as he spoke the last words we drew up in front of the fine old house
a lady in a stout tweed skirt who was bending over a flower bed straightened herself at our approach hullo evie here our wounded hero
mr_hastings miss_howard miss howard shook hand with a hearty almost painful grip i had an impression of very blue eyes in a sunburnt face
she was a pleasant looking woman of about forty with a deep voice almost manly in its stentorian tones and had a large sensible square body with feet to match these last encased in good thick boots
her conversation i soon found was couched in the telegraphic style weeds grow like house afire cant keep even with em
shall press you in better be careful i sure i shall be only too delighted to make myself useful i responded
dont say it never does wish you hadnt later you re a cynic evie said mr_john_cavendish laughing where tea to day inside or out
out too fine a day to be cooped up in the house come on then you ve done enough gardening for to day
the labourer is worthy of his hire you know come and be refreshed well said miss_howard drawing off her gardening gloves i inclined to agree with you
she led the way round the house to where tea was spread under the shade of a large sycamore a figure rose from one of the basket chairs and came a few steps to meet us
her tall slender form outlined against the bright light the vivid sense of slumbering fire that seemed to find expression only in those wonderful tawny eyes of hers remarkable eyes different from any other woman that i have ever known the intense power of stillness she possessed which nevertheless conveyed the impression of a wild untamed spirit in an exquisitely civilised body all these things are burnt into my memory
my wife mr_hastings said mr_john_cavendish i shall never forget my first sight of mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish i shall never forget them
she greeted me with a few words of pleasant welcome in a low clear voice and i sank into a basket chair feeling distinctly glad that i had accepted mr_john_cavendish invitation
mrs mr_john_cavendish gave me some tea and her few quiet remarks heightened my first impression of her as a thoroughly fascinating woman
an appreciative listener is always stimulating and i described in a humorous manner certain incidents of my convalescent home in a way which i flatter myself greatly amused my hostess
at that moment a well remembered voice floated through the open french window near at hand then you ll write to the princess after tea mr_alfred_inglethorp
mr_john_cavendish of course good fellow though he is could hardly be called a brilliant conversationalist i ll write to lady tadminster for the second day myself
or shall we wait until we hear from the princess in case of a refusal lady tadminster might open it the first day and mrs crosbie the second
then there the duchess about the school fete there was the murmur of a man voice and then mrs_inglethorp rose in reply yes certainly
the french window swung open a little wider and a handsome white haired old lady with a somewhat masterful cast of features stepped out of it on to the lawn
after tea will do quite well you are so thoughtful mr_alfred_inglethorp dear a man followed her a suggestion of deference in his manner
mrs_inglethorp greeted me with effusion why if it isnt too delightful to see you again mr_hastings after all these year
mr_alfred_inglethorp darling mr_hastings my husband i looked with some curiosity at mr_alfred_inglethorp darling he certainly struck a rather alien note
i did not wonder at mr_john_cavendish objecting to his beard it was one of the longest and blackest i have ever seen
he wore gold rimmed pince nez and had a curious impassivity of feature it struck me that he might look natural on a stage but was strangely out of place in real life
his voice was rather deep and unctuous he placed a wooden hand in mine and said this is a pleasure mr_hastings
then turning to his wife emily dearest i think that cushion is a little damp she beamed fondly on him as he substituted another with every demonstration of the tenderest care
strange infatuation of an otherwise sensible woman with the presence of mr mrs_inglethorp a sense of constraint and veiled hostility seemed to settle down upon the company
her volubility which i remembered of old had lost nothing in the intervening year and she poured out a steady flood of conversation mainly on the subject of the forthcoming bazaar which she was organizing and which was to take place shortly
miss_howard in particular took no pains to conceal her feelings mrs_inglethorp however seemed to notice nothing unusual occasionally she referred to her husband over a question of day or dates
from the very first i took a firm and rooted dislike to him and i flatter myself that my first judgments are usually fairly shrewd
presently mrs_inglethorp turned to give some instructions about letters to evelyn_howard and her husband addressed me in his painstaking voice is soldiering your regular profession mr_hastings
his watchful and attentive manner never varied no before the war i was in lloyd and you will return there after it is over
perhaps either that or a fresh start altogether mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish leant forward what would you really choose as a profession if you could just consult your inclination
well that depends no secret hobby she asked tell me you re drawn to something every one is usually something absurd
you ll laugh at me she smiled perhaps well i ve always had a secret hankering to be a detective
the real thing scotland yard or sherlock holmes oh sherlock holmes by all means but really seriously i am awfully drawn to it
i came across a man in belgium once a very famous detective and he quite inflamed me he was a marvellous little fellow
he used to say that all good detective work was a mere matter of method my system is based on his though of course i have progressed rather further
he was a funny little man a great dandy but wonderfully clever like a good detective story myself remarked miss_howard
lots of nonsense written though criminal discovered in last chapter every one dumbfounded real crime you know at once
there have been a great number of undiscovered crimes i argued dont mean the police but the people that are right in it
then i said much amused you think that if you were mixed up in a crime say a murder you be able to spot the murderer right off
the family you couldnt really hoodwink them they know of course i should mightnt be able to prove it to a pack of lawyers
but i certain i know i feel it in my fingertips if he came near me it might be a she i suggested
might but murder a violent crime associate it more with a man not in a case of poisoning
dr_bauerstein was saying yesterday that owing to the general ignorance of the more uncommon poisons among the medical profession there were probably countless case of poisoning quite unsuspected
mrs mr_john_cavendish clear voice startled me why mary_cavendish what a gruesome conversation cried mrs_inglethorp it makes me feel as if a goose were walking over my grave
oh there mademoiselle_cynthia a young girl in a uniform ran lightly across the lawn why mademoiselle_cynthia you are late to day
she tossed off her little a cap and i admired the great loose waves of her auburn hair and the smallness and whiteness of the hand she held out to claim her tea
this is mr_hastings miss murdoch mademoiselle_cynthia murdoch was a fresh looking young creature full of life and vigour with dark eyes and eyelashes she would have been a beauty
she flung herself down on the ground beside mr_john_cavendish and as i handed her a plate of sandwiches she smiled up at me
sit down here on the grass do it ever so much nicer i dropped down obediently you work at tadminster dont you miss murdoch
she nodded for my sins do they bully you then i asked smiling i should like to see them cried mademoiselle_cynthia with dignity
i have got a cousin who is nursing i remarked and she is terrified of sisters i dont wonder
sisters are you know mr_hastings they simp ly are you ve no idea but i not a nurse thank heaven
i work in the dispensary how many people do you poison i asked smiling mademoiselle_cynthia smiled too
oh hundreds she said mademoiselle_cynthia called mrs_inglethorp do you think you could write a few notes for me
she jumped up promptly and something in her manner reminded me that her position was a dependent one and that mrs_inglethorp kind as she might be in the main did not allow her to forget it
certainly aunt emily my hostess turned to me mr_john_cavendish will show you your room supper is at half past seven
we have given up late dinner for some time now lady tadminster our member wife she was the late lord abbotsbury daughter does the same
we are quite a war household nothing is wasted here every scrap of waste paper even is saved and sent away in sacks
i expressed my appreciation and mr_john_cavendish took me into the house and up the broad staircase which forked right and left half way to different wings of the building
she agrees with me that one must set an example of economy my room was in the left wing and looked out over the park
mr_john_cavendish left me and a few minutes later i saw him from my window walking slowly across the grass arm in arm with mademoiselle_cynthia murdoch
at the same moment a man stepped out from the shadow of a tree and walked slowly in the same direction
i heard mrs_inglethorp call mademoiselle_cynthia impatiently and the girl started and ran back to the house he looked about forty very dark with a melancholy clean shaven face
he looked up at my window as he passed and i recognized him though he had changed much in the fifteen year that had elapsed since we last met
some violent emotion seemed to be mastering him it was mr_john_cavendish younger brother monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish i wondered what it was that had brought that singular expression to his face
then i dismissed him from my mind and returned to the contemplation of my own affair the evening passed pleasantly enough and i dreamed that night of that enigmatical woman mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish
i did not see mrs mr_john_cavendish until lunch time when she volunteered to take me for a walk and we spent a charming afternoon roaming in the woods returning to the house about five
the next morning dawned bright and sunny and i was full of the anticipation of a delightful visit as we entered the large hall mr_john_cavendish beckoned us both into the smoking room
i saw at once by his face that something disturbing had occurred we followed him in and he shut the door after us
look here mary_cavendish there the deuce of a mess evie had a row with mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp and she off evie
off mr_john_cavendish nodded gloomily yes you see she went to the mater and oh here evie herself miss_howard entered
her lips were set grimly together and she carried a small suit case she looked excited and determined and slightly on the defensive
at any rate she burst out i ve spoken my mind my dear evelyn_howard cried mrs mr_john_cavendish this cant be true
miss_howard nodded grimly true enough afraid i said some things to emily she wont forget or forgive in a hurry
dont mind if they ve only sunk in a bit probably water off a duck back though i said right out you re an old woman emily and there no fool like an old fool
the man twenty year younger than you and dont you fool yourself as to what he married you for money well dont let him have too much of it
farmer mrs_raikes has got a very pretty young wife just ask your mr_alfred_inglethorp how much time he spends over there she was very angry
natural i went on i going to warn you whether you like it or not that man would as soon murder you in your bed as look at you
he a bad lot you can say what you like to me but remember what i ve told you he a bad lot
what did she say miss_howard made an extremely expressive grimace darling mr_alfred_inglethorp dearest mr_alfred_inglethorp wicked calumnies wicked lies wicked woman to accuse her dear husband
the sooner i left her house the better so i off but not now this minute for a moment we sat and stared at her
finally mr_john_cavendish finding his persuasions of no avail went off to look up the trains his wife followed him murmuring something about persuading mrs_inglethorp to think better of it
as she left the room miss_howard face changed she leant towards me eagerly mr_hastings you re honest i can trust you
i was a little startled she laid her hand on my arm and sank her voice to a whisper
look after her mr_hastings my poor emily they re a lot of sharks all of them oh i know what i talking about
there isnt one of them that not hard up and trying to get money out of her i ve protected her as much as i could
now i out of the way they ll impose upon her of course miss_howard i said i ll do everything i can but i sure you re excited and overwrought
she interrupted me by slowly shaking her forefinger young man trust me i ve lived in the world rather longer than you have
all i ask you is to keep your eyes open you ll see what i mean the throb of the motor came through the open window and miss_howard rose and moved to the door
mr_john_cavendish voice sounded outside with her hand on the handle she turned her head over her shoulder and beckoned to me
above all mr_hastings watch that devil her husband there was no time for more miss_howard was swallowed up in an eager chorus of protests and good byes
as the motor drove away mrs mr_john_cavendish suddenly detached herself from the group and moved across the drive to the lawn to meet a tall bearded man who had been evidently making for the house
the inglethorps did not appear the colour rose in her cheeks as she held out her hand to him who is that
i asked sharply for instinctively i distrusted the man that dr_bauerstein said mr_john_cavendish shortly and who is dr_bauerstein
he staying in the village doing a rest cure after a bad nervous breakdown he a london specialist a very clever man one of the greatest living experts on poisons i believe
and he a great friend of mary_cavendish put in mademoiselle_cynthia the irrepressible mr_john_cavendish frowned and changed the subject
come for a stroll mr_hastings this has been a most rotten business she always had a rough tongue but there is no stauncher friend in england than evelyn_howard
he took the path through the plantation and we walked down to the village through the woods which bordered one side of the estate
as we passed through one of the gates on our way home again a pretty young woman of gipsy type coming in the opposite direction bowed and smiled
that a pretty girl i remarked appreciatively mr_john_cavendish face hardened that is mrs_raikes the one that miss_howard
i thought of the white haired old lady in the big house and that vivid wicked little face that had just smiled into ours and a vague chill of foreboding crept over me
exactly said mr_john_cavendish with rather unnecessary abruptness i brushed it aside styles is really a glorious old place i said to mr_john_cavendish
he nodded rather gloomily yes it a fine property it ll be mine some day should be mine now by rights if my father had only made a decent will
and then i shouldnt be so damned hard up as i am now hard up are you my dear mr_hastings i dont mind telling you that i at my wits end for money
couldnt your brother help you monsieur_lawrence he gone through every penny he ever had publishing rotten verses in fancy bindings no we re an impecunious lot
my mother always been awfully good to us i must say that is up to now since her marriage of course he broke off frowning
for the first time i felt that with evelyn_howard something indefinable had gone from the atmosphere her presence had spelt security
now that security was removed and the air seemed rife with suspicion the sinister face of dr_bauerstein recurred to me unpleasantly
a vague suspicion of every one and everything filled my mind just for a moment i had a premonition of approaching evil
chapter ii the th and th of july i had arrived at styles on the th of july i come now to the events of the th and th of that month
for the convenience of the reader i will recapitulate the incidents of those day in as exact a manner as possible
i received a letter from evelyn_howard a couple of day after her departure telling me she was working as a nurse at the big hospital in middlingham a manufacturing town some fifteen miles away and begging me to let her know if mrs_inglethorp should show any wish to be reconciled
the only fly in the ointment of my peaceful day was mrs mr_john_cavendish extraordinary and for my part unaccountable preference for the society of dr_bauerstein
what she saw in the man i cannot imagine but she was always asking him up to the house and often went off for long expeditions with him
they were elicited subsequently at the trial by a process of long and tedious cross examinations i must confess that i was quite unable to see his attraction
the famous bazaar had taken place on saturday and an entertainment in connection with the same charity at which mrs_inglethorp was to recite a war poem was to be held that night
we were all busy during the morning arranging and decorating the hall in the village where it was to take place
the th of july fell on a monday it was a day of turmoil we had a late luncheon and spent the afternoon resting in the garden
i noticed that mr_john_cavendish manner was somewhat unusual he seemed very excited and restless after tea mrs_inglethorp went to lie down to rest before her efforts in the evening
and i challenged mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish to a single at tennis about a quarter to seven mrs_inglethorp called us that we should be late as supper was early that night
we had rather a scramble to get ready in time and before the meal was over the motor was waiting at the door
the entertainment was a great success mrs_inglethorp recitation receiving tremendous applause there were also some tableaux in which mademoiselle_cynthia took part
she did not return with us having been asked to a supper party and to remain the night with some friend who had been acting with her in the tableaux
the following morning mrs_inglethorp stayed in bed to breakfast as she was rather overtired but she appeared in her briskest mood about and swept monsieur_lawrence and myself off to a luncheon party
such a charming invitation from mrs rolleston lady tadminster sister you know the rollestons came over with the conqueror one of our oldest families
we had a pleasant luncheon and as we drove away monsieur_lawrence suggested that we should return by tadminster which was barely a mile out of our way and pay a visit to mademoiselle_cynthia in her dispensary
mrs_inglethorp replied that this was an excellent idea but as she had several letters to write she would drop us there and we could come back with mademoiselle_cynthia in the pony trap
we were detained under suspicion by the hospital porter until mademoiselle_cynthia appeared to vouch for us looking very cool and sweet in her long white overall
she took us up to her sanctum and introduced us to her fellow dispenser a rather awe inspiring individual whom mademoiselle_cynthia cheerily addressed as nibs
mary_cavendish had excused herself on the plea of an engagement with dr_bauerstein what a lot of bottle
i exclaimed as my eye travelled round the small room do you really know what in them all say something original groaned mademoiselle_cynthia
we are really thinking of bestowing a prize on the first individual who does not say what a lot of bottle
every single person who comes up here says that and i know the next thing you re going to say is how many people have you poisoned
i pleaded guilty with a laugh if you people only knew how fatally easy it is to poison someone by mistake you wouldnt joke about it
come on let have tea we ve got all sorts of secret stories in that cupboard no monsieur_lawrence that the poison cupboard the big cupboard that right
we had a very cheery tea and assisted mademoiselle_cynthia to wash up afterwards we had just put away the last tea spoon when a knock came at the door
the countenances of mademoiselle_cynthia and nibs were suddenly petrified into a stern and forbidding expression come in said mademoiselle_cynthia in a sharp professional tone
a young and rather scared looking nurse appeared with a bottle which she proffered to nibs who waved her towards mademoiselle_cynthia with the somewhat enigmatical remark i not really here to day
mademoiselle_cynthia took the bottle and examined it with the severity of a judge this should have been sent up this morning
i gathered from the little nurse expression that there was not the least likelihood of her having the hardihood to retail this message to the dreaded sister
sister is very sorry she forgot sister should read the rules outside the door so now it cant be done until to morrow finished mademoiselle_cynthia
dont you think you could possibly let us have it to night well said mademoiselle_cynthia graciously we are very busy but if we have time it shall be done
the little nurse withdrew and mademoiselle_cynthia promptly took a jar from the shelf refilled the bottle and placed it on the table outside the door
i laughed discipline must be maintained exactly come out on our little balcony you can see all the outside wards there
i followed mademoiselle_cynthia and her friend and they pointed out the different wards to me monsieur_lawrence remained behind but after a few moments mademoiselle_cynthia called to him over her shoulder to come and join us
then she looked at her watch nothing more to do nibs no all right then we can lock up and go
i had seen monsieur_lawrence in quite a different light that afternoon compared to mr_john_cavendish he was an astoundingly difficult person to get to know
yet he had a certain charm of manner and i fancied that if one really knew him well one could have a deep affection for him
i had always fancied that his manner to mademoiselle_cynthia was rather constrained and that she on her side was inclined to be shy of him
he was the opposite of his brother in almost every respect being unusually shy and reserved but they were both gay enough this afternoon and chatted together like a couple of children
as we drove through the village i remembered that i wanted some stamps so accordingly we pulled up at the post office
i drew aside and apologised when suddenly with a loud exclamation he clasped me in his arms and kissed me warmly
as i came out again i cannoned into a little man who was just entering mon ami mr_hastings he cried
it is indeed mon ami mr_hastings hercule_poirot i exclaimed i turned to the pony trap this is a very pleasant meeting for me miss mademoiselle_cynthia
this is my old friend monsieur hercule_poirot whom i have not seen for year oh we know monsieur hercule_poirot said mademoiselle_cynthia gaily
but i had no idea he was a friend of yours yes indeed said hercule_poirot seriously i know mademoiselle_cynthia
then as i looked at him inquiringly yes my friend she had kindly extended hospitality to seven of my countrypeople who alas are refugees from their native land
it is by the charity of that good mrs_inglethorp that i am here we belgians will always remember her with gratitude
hercule_poirot was an extraordinary looking little man he was hardly more than five feet four inches but carried himself with great dignity
his head was exactly the shape of an egg and he always perched it a little on one side his moustache was very stiff and military
the neatness of his attire was almost incredible i believe a speck of dust would have caused him more pain than a bullet wound
yet this quaint dandified little man who i was sorry to see now limped badly had been in his time one of the most celebrated members of the belgian police
as a detective his flair had been extraordinary and he had achieved triumphs by unravelling some of the most baffling case of the day
he pointed out to me the little house inhabited by him and his fellow belgians and i promised to go and see him at an early date
then he raised his hat with a flourish to mademoiselle_cynthia and we drove away he a dear little man said mademoiselle_cynthia
i no idea you knew him you ve been entertaining a celebrity unawares i replied and for the rest of the way home i recited to them the various exploits and triumphs of hercule_poirot
we arrived back in a very cheerful mood as we entered the hall mrs_inglethorp came out of her boudoir she looked flushed and upset
oh it you she said is there anything the matter aunt emily asked mademoiselle_cynthia certainly not said mrs_inglethorp sharply
then catching sight of mademoiselle_dorcas the parlourmaid going into the dining room she called to her to bring some stamps into the boudoir
what should there be yes m the old servant hesitated then added diffidently dont you think m you better get to bed
you re looking very tired perhaps you re right mademoiselle_dorcas yes no not now i ve some letters i must finish by post time have you lighted the fire in my room as i told you
yes m then i ll go to bed directly after supper she went into the boudoir again and mademoiselle_cynthia stared after her
he did not seem to have heard her for without a word he turned on his heel and went out of the house
goodness gracious i wonder what up she said to monsieur_lawrence i suggested a quick game of tennis before supper and mademoiselle_cynthia agreeing i ran upstairs to fetch my racquet
mrs mr_john_cavendish was coming down the stairs it may have been my fancy but she too was looking odd and disturbed
had a good walk with dr_bauerstein i asked trying to appear as indifferent as i could i didnt go she replied abruptly
her hand clenched itself on the banisters then she seemed to nerve herself for some encounter and went rapidly past me down the stairs across the hall to the boudoir the door of which she shut behind her
as i ran out to the tennis court a few moments later i had to pass the open boudoir window and was unable to help overhearing the following scrap of dialogue
where is mrs_inglethorp in the boudoir mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish was saying in the voice of a woman desperately controlling herself then you wont show it to me
to which mrs_inglethorp replied my dear mary_cavendish it has nothing to do with that matter then show it to me
i tell you it is not what you imagine it does not concern you in the least to which mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish replied with a rising bitterness of course i might have known you would shield him
mademoiselle_cynthia was waiting for me and greeted me eagerly with i say there been the most awful row i ve got it all out of mademoiselle_dorcas
what kind of a row between aunt emily and him i do hope she found him out at last
was mademoiselle_dorcas there then of course not she happened to be near the door it was a real old bust up i do wish i knew what it was all about
i thought of mrs_raikes gipsy face and evelyn_howard warnings but wisely decided to hold my peace whilst mademoiselle_cynthia exhausted every possible hypothesis and cheerfully hoped aunt emily will send him away and will never speak to him again
i was anxious to get hold of mr_john_cavendish but he was nowhere to be seen evidently something very momentous had occurred that afternoon
i tried to forget the few words i had overheard but do what i would i could not dismiss them altogether from my mind
what was mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish concern in the matter mr mrs_inglethorp was in the drawing room when i came down to supper his face was impassive as ever and the strange unreality of the man struck me afresh
mrs_inglethorp came down last she still looked agitated and during the meal there was a somewhat constrained silence mrs_inglethorp was unusually quiet
as a rule he surrounded his wife with little attentions placing a cushion at her back and altogether playing the part of the devoted husband
immediately after supper mrs_inglethorp retired to her boudoir again send my coffee in here mary_cavendish she called i ve just five minutes to catch the post
mademoiselle_cynthia and i went and sat by the open window in the drawing room mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish brought our coffee to us
she seemed excited do you young people want lights or do you enjoy the twilight she asked will you take mrs_inglethorp her coffee mademoiselle_cynthia
i will pour it out do not trouble mary_cavendish said mrs_inglethorp i will take it to emily he poured it out and went out of the room carrying it carefully
monsieur_lawrence followed him and mrs mr_john_cavendish sat down by us we three sat for some time in silence it was a glorious night hot and still
mrs mr_john_cavendish fanned herself gently with a palm leaf it almost too hot she murmured we shall have a thunderstorm
alas that these harmonious moments can never endure my paradise was rudely shattered by the sound of a well known and heartily disliked voice in the hall
dr_bauerstein exclaimed mademoiselle_cynthia what a funny time to come i glanced jealously at mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish but she seemed quite undisturbed the delicate pallor of her cheeks did not vary
in a few moments mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp had ushered the doctor in the latter laughing and protesting that he was in no fit state for a drawing room
in truth he presented a sorry spectacle being literally plastered with mud what have you been doing doctor cried mrs mr_john_cavendish
i must make my apologies said the doctor i did not really mean to come in but mr mrs_inglethorp insisted
well dr_bauerstein you are in a plight said mr_john_cavendish strolling in from the hall have some coffee and tell us what you have been up to
he laughed rather ruefully as he described how he had discovered a very rare species of fern in an inaccessible place and in his efforts to obtain it had lost his footing and slipped ignominiously into a neighbouring pond
thank you i will the sun soon dried me off he added but i afraid my appearance is very disreputable
at this juncture mrs_inglethorp called to mademoiselle_cynthia from the hall and the girl ran out just carry up my despatch case will you dear
i going to bed the door into the hall was a wide one i had risen when mademoiselle_cynthia did mr_john_cavendish was close by me
there were therefore three witness who could swear that mrs_inglethorp was carrying her coffee as yet untasted in her hand
my evening was utterly and entirely spoilt by the presence of dr_bauerstein it seemed to me the man would never go
he rose at last however and i breathed a sigh of relief i ll walk down to the village with you said mr mrs_inglethorp
i must see our agent over those estate accounts he turned to mr_john_cavendish no one need sit up
the night of the tragedy to make this part of my story clear i append the following plan of the first floor of styles
i will take the latch key chapter iii the servants room are reached through the door they have no communication with the right wing where the inglethorps room were situated
he had a candle in his hand and the agitation of his face told me at once that something was seriously wrong
it seemed to be the middle of the night when i was awakened by monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish what the matter
i asked sitting up in bed and trying to collect my scattered thoughts we are afraid my mother is very ill
i sprang out of bed and pulling on a dressing gown followed monsieur_lawrence along the passage and the gallery to the right wing of the house
she seems to be having some kind of fit unfortunately she has locked herself in i ll come at once mr_john_cavendish joined us and one or two of the servants were standing round in a state of awe stricken excitement
monsieur_lawrence turned to his brother what do you think we had better do never i thought had his indecision of character been more apparent
mr_john_cavendish rattled the handle of mrs_inglethorp door violently but with no effect it was obviously locked or bolted on the inside
the whole household was aroused by now the most alarming sounds were audible from the interior of the room clearly something must be done
try going through mr mrs_inglethorp room sir cried mademoiselle_dorcas oh the poor mistress suddenly i realized that mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp was not with us that he alone had given no sign of his presence
it was pitch dark but monsieur_lawrence was following with the candle and by its feeble light we saw that the bed had not been slept in and that there was no sign of the room having been occupied
mr_john_cavendish opened the door of his room we went straight to the connecting door that too was locked or bolted on the inside
what was to be done oh dear sir cried mademoiselle_dorcas wringing her hand what ever shall we do we must try and break the door in i suppose
here let one of the maids go down and wake baily and tell him to go for dr_wilkins at once
it ll be a tough job though now then we ll have a try at the door half a moment though isnt there a door into miss mademoiselle_cynthia room
yes sir but that always bolted it never been undone well we might just see he ran rapidly down the corridor to mademoiselle_cynthia room
mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish was there shaking the girl who must have been an unusually sound sleeper and trying to wake her in a moment or two he was back
no good that bolted too we must break in the door i think this one is a shade less solid than the one in the passage
the framework of the door was solid and for a long time it resisted our efforts but at last we felt it give beneath our weight and finally with a resounding crash it was burst open
mrs_inglethorp was lying on the bed her whole form agitated by violent convulsions in one of which she must have overturned the table beside her
we strained and heaved together we stumbled in together monsieur_lawrence still holding his candle as we entered however her limbs relaxed and she fell back upon the pillows
mr_john_cavendish strode across the room and lit the gas turning to annie one of the housemaids he sent her downstairs to the dining room for brandy
i turned to monsieur_lawrence to suggest that i had better leave them now that there was no further need of my services but the words were frozen on my lips
then he went across to his mother whilst i unbolted the door that gave on the corridor never have i seen such a ghastly look on any man face
he was white as chalk the candle he held in his shaking hand was sputtering onto the carpet and his eyes petrified with terror or some such kindred emotion stared fixedly over my head at a point on the further wall
it was as though he had seen something that turned him to stone i instinctively followed the direction of his eyes but i could see nothing unusual
the still feebly flickering ashes in the grate and the row of prim ornaments on the mantelpiece were surely harmless enough
the violence of mrs_inglethorp attack seemed to be passing she was able to speak in short gasps better now very sudden stupid of me to lock myself in
a shadow fell on the bed and looking up i saw mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish standing near the door with her arm around mademoiselle_cynthia
she seemed to be supporting the girl who looked utterly dazed and unlike herself her face was heavily flushed and she yawned repeatedly
poor mademoiselle_cynthia is quite frightened said mrs mr_john_cavendish in a low clear voice she herself i noticed was dressed in her white land smock
i saw that a faint streak of daylight was showing through the curtains of the windows and that the clock on the mantelpiece pointed to close upon five clock
then it must be later than i thought a strangled cry from the bed startled me a fresh access of pain seized the unfortunate old lady
the convulsions were of a violence terrible to behold everything was confusion we thronged round her powerless to help or alleviate
a final convulsion lifted her from the bed until she appeared to rest upon her head and her heels with her body arched in an extraordinary manner
in vain mary_cavendish and mr_john_cavendish tried to administer more brandy the moments flew again the body arched itself in that peculiar fashion
for one instant he stopped dead staring at the figure on the bed and at the same instant mrs_inglethorp cried out in a strangled voice her eyes fixed on the doctor
at that moment dr_bauerstein pushed his way authoritatively into the room mr_alfred_inglethorp alfred then she fell back motionless on the pillows
with a stride the doctor reached the bed and seizing her arms worked them energetically applying what i knew to be artificial respiration
he issued a few short sharp orders to the servants an imperious wave of his hand drove us all to the door
we watched him fascinated though i think we all knew in our hearts that it was too late and that nothing could be done now
i could see by the expression on his face that he himself had little hope finally he abandoned his task shaking his head gravely
at that moment we heard footsteps outside and dr_wilkins mrs_inglethorp own doctor a portly fussy little man came bustling in
in a few words dr_bauerstein explained how he had happened to be passing the lodge gates as the car came out and had run up to the house as fast as he could whilst the car went on to fetch dr_wilkins
with a faint gesture of the hand he indicated the figure on the bed ve ry sad ve ry sad murmured dr_wilkins
poor dear lady always did far too much far too much against my advice i warned her her heart was far from strong
take it easy i said to her take it easy but no her zeal for good works was too great nature rebelled na ture re belled
dr_bauerstein i noticed was watching the local doctor narrowly he still kept his eyes fixed on him as he spoke
the convulsions were of a peculiar violence dr_wilkins i am sorry you were not here in time to witness them
they were quite tetanic in character ah said dr_wilkins wisely i should like to speak to you in private said dr_bauerstein
we all trooped out into the corridor leaving the two doctors alone and i heard the key turned in the lock behind us
he turned to mr_john_cavendish you do not object certainly not we went slowly down the stairs i was violently excited
i have a certain talent for deduction and dr_bauerstein manner had started a flock of wild surmises in my mind
mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish laid her hand upon my arm what is it why did dr_bauerstein seem so peculiar i looked at her
do you know what i think what listen i looked round the others were out of earshot i lowered my voice to a whisper
i believe she has been poisoned i certain dr_bauerstein suspects it what she shrank against the wall the pupils of her eyes dilating wildly
then with a sudden cry that startled me she cried out no no not that not that and breaking from me fled up the stairs
i followed her afraid that she was going to faint i found her leaning against the bannisters deadly pale she waved me away impatiently
no no leave me i rather be alone let me just be quiet for a minute or two go down to the others
we were all silent but i suppose i voiced the thoughts of us all when i at last broke it by saying where is mr mrs_inglethorp
i obeyed her reluctantly mr_john_cavendish and monsieur_lawrence were in the dining room i joined them mr_john_cavendish shook his head
he not in the house our eyes met where was mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp his absence was strange and inexplicable i remembered mrs_inglethorp dying words
what lay beneath them what more could she have told us if she had had time at last we heard the doctors descending the stairs
dr_wilkins was looking important and excited and trying to conceal an inward exultation under a manner of decorous calm dr_bauerstein remained in the background his grave bearded face unchanged
dr_wilkins was the spokesman for the two he addressed himself to mr_john_cavendish mr_john_cavendish i should like your consent to a postmortem
is that necessary asked mr_john_cavendish gravely a spasm of pain crossed his face absolutely said dr_bauerstein you mean by that
that neither dr_wilkins nor myself could give a death certificate under the circumstances mr_john_cavendish bent his head
in that case i have no alternative but to agree thank you said dr_wilkins briskly we propose that it should take place to morrow night or rather to night
under the circumstances i am afraid an inquest can hardly be avoided these formalities are necessary but i beg that you wont distress yourselves
and he glanced at the daylight there was a pause and then dr_bauerstein drew two keys from his pocket and handed them to mr_john_cavendish
these are the keys of the two room i have locked them and in my opinion they would be better kept locked for the present
i had been turning over an idea in my head and i felt that the moment had now come to broach it
mr_john_cavendish i knew had a horror of any kind of publicity and was an easygoing optimist who preferred never to meet trouble half way
the doctors then departed yet i was a little chary of doing so it might be difficult to convince him of the soundness of my plan
monsieur_lawrence on the other hand being less conventional and having more imagination i felt i might count upon as an ally
there was no doubt that the moment had come for me to take the lead mr_john_cavendish i said i am going to ask you something
well you remember my speaking of my friend hercule_poirot the belgian who is here he has been a most famous detective
yes i want you to let me call him in to investigate this matter what now before the post mortem yes time is an advantage if if there has been foul play
rubbish cried monsieur_lawrence angrily in my opinion the whole thing is a mare nest of dr_bauerstein dr_wilkins hadnt an idea of such a thing until dr_bauerstein put it into his head
but like all specialists dr_bauerstein got a bee in his bonnet poisons are his hobby so of course he sees them everywhere
i confess that i was surprised by monsieur_lawrence attitude he was so seldom vehement about anything mr_john_cavendish hesitated i cant feel as you do monsieur_lawrence he said at last
i inclined to give mr_hastings a free hand though i should prefer to wait a bit we dont want any unnecessary scandal
no no i cried eagerly you need have no fear of that hercule_poirot is discretion itself very well then have it your own way
i leave it in your hand though if it is as we suspect it seems a clear enough case god forgive me if i am wronging him
i looked at my watch it was six clock i determined to lose no time five minutes delay however i allowed myself
i spent it in ransacking the library until i discovered a medical book which gave a description of strychnine poisoning chapter iv
one could save time by taking a narrow path through the long grass which cut off the detours of the winding drive
hercule_poirot investigates the house which the belgians occupied in the village was quite close to the park gates so i accordingly went that way
i had nearly reached the lodge when my attention was arrested by the running figure of a man approaching me it was mr mrs_inglethorp
where had he been how did he intend to explain his absence he accosted me eagerly my god this is terrible
my poor wife i have only just heard where have you been i asked denby kept me late last night
it was one clock before we finished then i found that i forgotten the latch key after all i didnt want to arouse the household so denby gave me a bed
how did you hear the news i asked dr_wilkins knocked denby up to tell him my poor emily
she was so self sacrificing such a noble character she over taxed her strength a wave of revulsion swept over me what a consummate hypocrite the man was
i must hurry on i said thankful that he did not ask me whither i was bound in a few minutes i was knocking at the door of leastways cottage
getting no answer i repeated my summons impatiently a window above me was cautiously opened and hercule_poirot himself looked out he gave an exclamation of surprise at seeing me
in a few brief words i explained the tragedy that had occurred and that i wanted his help wait my friend i will let you in and you shall recount to me the affair whilst i dress
there he installed me in a chair and i related the whole story keeping back nothing and omitting no circumstance however insignificant whilst he himself made a careful and deliberate toilet
i told him of my awakening of mrs_inglethorp dying words of her husband absence of the quarrel the day before of the scrap of conversation between mary_cavendish and her mother in law that i had overheard of the former quarrel between mrs_inglethorp and evelyn_howard and of the latter innuendoes
in a few moments he had unbarred the door and i followed him up to his room i was hardly as clear as i could wish
i repeated myself several time and occasionally had to go back to some detail that i had forgotten hercule_poirot smiled kindly on me
the mind is confused is it not so take time mon ami you are agitated you are excited it is but natural
those of importance we will put on one side those of no importance pouf he screwed up his cherub like face and puffed comically enough blow them away
presently when we are calmer we will arrange the facts neatly each in his proper place we will examine and reject
that all very well i objected but how are you going to decide what is important and what isnt that always seems the difficulty to me
hercule_poirot shook his head energetically he was now arranging his moustache with exquisite care not so voyons one fact leads to another so we continue
does the next fit in with that a merveille good we can proceed this next little fact no ah that is curious
there is something missing a link in the chain that is not there we examine we search and that little curious fact that possibly paltry little detail that will not tally we put it here
he made an extravagant gesture with his hand it is significant it is tremendous es ah hercule_poirot shook his forefinger so fiercely at me that i quailed before it
beware peril to the detective who says it is so small it does not matter it will not agree i will forget it
that way lies confusion everything matters i know you always told me that that why i have gone into all the details of this thing whether they seemed to me relevant or not
and i am pleased with you you have a good memory and you have given me the facts faithfully of the order in which you present them i say nothing truly it is deplorable
but i make allowances you are upset to that i attribute the circumstance that you have omitted one fact of paramount importance
what is that i asked you have not told me if mrs_inglethorp ate well last night
i stared at him surely the war had affected the little man brain he was carefully engaged in brushing his coat before putting it on and seemed wholly engrossed in the task
i dont remember i said and anyway i dont see you do not see but it is of the first importance
i cant see why i said rather nettled as far as i can remember she didnt eat much she was obviously upset and it had taken her appetite away
that was only natural yes said hercule_poirot thoughtfully it was only natural he opened a drawer and took out a small despatch case then turned to me
now i am ready we will proceed to the chateau and study matters on the spot excuse me mon ami you dressed in haste and your tie is on one side
permit me with a deft gesture he rearranged it ça est now shall we start we hurried up the village and turned in at the lodge gates
hercule_poirot stopped for a moment and gazed sorrowfully over the beautiful expanse of park still glittering with morning dew so beautiful so beautiful and yet the poor family plunged in sorrow prostrated with grief
he looked at me keenly as he spoke and i was aware that i reddened under his prolonged gaze was the family prostrated by grief
was the sorrow at mrs_inglethorp death so great i realized that there was an emotional lack in the atmosphere the dead woman had not the gift of commanding love
her death was a shock and a distress but she would not be passionately regretted hercule_poirot seemed to follow my thoughts
he nodded his head gravely no you are right he said it is not as though there was a blood tie
she has been kind and generous to these cavendishes but she was not their own mother blood tells always remember that blood tells
hercule_poirot i said i wish you would tell me why you wanted to know if mrs_inglethorp ate well last night
i have been turning it over in my mind but i cant see how it has anything to do with the matter
he was silent for a minute or two as we walked along but finally he said i do not mind telling you though as you know it is not my habit to explain until the end is reached
the present contention is that mrs_inglethorp died of strychnine poisoning presumably administered in her coffee yes well what time was the coffee served
about eight clock therefore she drank it between then and half past eight certainly not much later well strychnine is a fairly rapid poison
its effects would be felt very soon probably in about an hour yet in mrs_inglethorp case the symptoms do not manifest themselves until five clock the next morning nine hours
but a heavy meal taken at about the same time as the poison might retard its effects though hardly to that extent
but according to you she ate very little for supper and yet the symptoms do not develop until early the next morning
still it is a possibility to be taken into account now that is a curious circumstance my friend something may arise at the autopsy to explain it
in the meantime remember it as we neared the house mr_john_cavendish came out and met us his face looked weary and haggard
this is a very dreadful business monsieur hercule_poirot he said mr_hastings has explained to you that we are anxious for no publicity
i comprehend perfectly you see it is only suspicion so far we have nothing to go upon precisely it is a matter of precaution only
mr_john_cavendish turned to me taking out his cigarette case and lighting a cigarette as he did so you know that fellow mrs_inglethorp is back
yes i met him mr_john_cavendish flung the match into an adjacent flower bed a proceeding which was too much for hercule_poirot feelings
he retrieved it and buried it neatly it jolly difficult to know how to treat him that difficulty will not exist long pronounced hercule_poirot quietly
mr_john_cavendish looked puzzled not quite understanding the portent of this cryptic saying he handed the two keys which dr_bauerstein had given him to me
show monsieur hercule_poirot everything he wants to see the room are locked asked hercule_poirot dr_bauerstein considered it advisable
hercule_poirot nodded thoughtfully then he is very sure well that simplifies matters for us we went up together to the room of the tragedy
for convenience i append a plan of the room and the principal articles of furniture in it hercule_poirot locked the door on the inside and proceeded to a minute inspection of the room
he darted from one object to the other with the agility of a grasshopper i remained by the door fearing to obliterate any clues
hercule_poirot however did not seem grateful to me for my forbearance what have you my friend he cried that you remain there like how do you say it ah yes the stuck pig
i explained that i was afraid of obliterating any foot marks foot marks but what an idea there has already been practically an army in the room
what foot marks are we likely to find no come here and aid me in my search i will put down my little case until i need it
he did so on the round table by the window but it was an ill advised proceeding for the top of it being loose it tilted up and precipitated the despatch case on the floor
eh voilà une table cried hercule_poirot ah my friend one may live in a big house and yet have no comfort
after which piece of moralizing he resumed his search a small purple despatch case with a key in the lock on the writing table engaged his attention for some time
he took out the key from the lock and passed it to me to inspect i saw nothing peculiar however it was an ordinary key of the yale type with a bit of twisted wire through the handle
next he examined the framework of the door we had broken in assuring himself that the bolt had really been shot
however he went to the length of unbolting it and opening and shutting it several time this he did with the utmost precaution against making any noise
then he went to the door opposite leading into mademoiselle_cynthia room that door was also bolted as i had stated suddenly something in the bolt itself seemed to rivet his attention
he examined it carefully and then nimbly whipping out a pair of small forceps from his case he drew out some minute particle which he carefully sealed up in a tiny envelope
a small quantity of a dark fluid remained in the saucepan and an empty cup and saucer that had been drunk out of stood near it
on the chest of drawers there was a tray with a spirit lamp and a small saucepan on it i wondered how i could have been so unobservant as to overlook this
here was a clue worth having hercule_poirot delicately dipped his finger into liquid and tasted it gingerly he made a grimace
cocoa with i think rum in it he passed on to the debris on the floor where the table by the bed had been overturned
a reading lamp some books matches a bunch of keys and the crushed fragments of a coffee cup lay scattered about ah this is curious said hercule_poirot
i must confess that i see nothing particularly curious about it you do not observe the lamp the chimney is broken in two places they lie there as they fell
but see the coffee cup is absolutely smashed to powder well i said wearily i suppose someone must have stepped on it
he rose from his knees and walked slowly across to the mantelpiece where he stood abstractedly fingering the ornaments and straightening them a trick of his when he was agitated
mon ami he said turning to me somebody stepped on that cup grinding it to powder and the reason they did so was either because it contained strychnine or which is far more serious because it did not contain strychnine
exactly said hercule_poirot in an odd voice someone stepped on it i made no reply i was bewildered but i knew that it was no good asking him to explain
he picked up the bunch of keys from the floor and twirling them round in his fingers finally selected one very bright and shining which he tried in the lock of the purple despatch case
it fitted and he opened the box but after a moment hesitation closed and relocked it and slipped the bunch of keys as well as the key that had originally stood in the lock into his own pocket
in a moment or two he roused himself and went on with his investigations i have no authority to go through these paper
crossing the room to the left hand window a round stain hardly visible on the dark brown carpet seemed to interest him particularly
but it should be done at once he then made a very careful examination of the drawers of the wash stand he went down on his knees examining it minutely even going so far as to smell it
finally he poured a few drops of the cocoa into a test tube sealing it we have found in this room he said writing busily six points of interest
one a coffee cup that has been ground into powder two a despatch case with a key in the lock three a stain on the floor
shall i enumerate them or will you oh you i replied hastily very well then that may have been done some time ago i interrupted
no for it is still perceptibly damp and smells of coffee four a fragment of some dark green fabric only a thread or two but recognizable
ah i cried that was what you sealed up in the envelope yes it may turn out to be a piece of one of mrs_inglethorp own dresses and quite unimportant
we shall see five this with a dramatic gesture he pointed to a large splash of candle grease on the floor by the writing table
it must have been done since yesterday otherwise a good housemaid would have at once removed it with blotting paper and a hot iron
one of my best hats once but that is not to the point it was very likely done last night
we were very agitated or perhaps mrs_inglethorp herself dropped her candle you brought only one candle into the room
yes monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish was carrying it but he was very upset he seemed to see something over here i indicated the mantelpiece that absolutely paralysed him
it was not his candle that made this great patch for you perceive that this is white grease whereas monsieur_lawrence candle which is still on the dressing table is pink
that is interesting said hercule_poirot quickly yes it is suggestive his eye sweeping the whole length of the wall but on the other hand mrs_inglethorp had no candlestick in the room only a reading lamp
then i said what do you deduce to which my friend only made a rather irritating reply urging me to use my own natural faculties
and the sixth point i asked i suppose it is the sample of cocoa no said hercule_poirot thoughtfully
i might have included that in the six but i did not no the sixth point i will keep to myself for the present
there is nothing more to be done here i think unless he stared earnestly and long at the dead ashes in the grate
he looked quickly round the room the fire burns and it destroys but by chance there might be let us see
deftly on hand and knees he began to sort the ashes from the grate into the fender handling them with the greatest caution
suddenly he gave a faint exclamation the forceps mr_hastings i quickly handed them to him and with skill he extracted a small piece of half charred paper
there mon ami he cried what do you think of that i scrutinized the fragment this is an exact reproduction of it i was puzzled
it was unusually thick quite unlike ordinary notepaper suddenly an idea struck me hercule_poirot i cried this is a fragment of a will
exactly i looked up at him sharply you are not surprised no he said gravely i expected it
i relinquished the piece of paper and watched him put it away in his case with the same methodical care that he bestowed on everything
my brain was in a whirl what was this complication of a will who had destroyed it the person who had left the candle grease on the floor
obviously but how had anyone gained admission all the doors had been bolted on the inside now my friend said hercule_poirot briskly we will go
we passed through mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp room and hercule_poirot delayed long enough to make a brief but fairly comprehensive examination of it
i should like to ask a few questions of the parlourmaid mademoiselle_dorcas her name is is it not we went out through that door locking both it and that of mrs_inglethorp room as before
i took him down to the boudoir which he had expressed a wish to see and went myself in search of mademoiselle_dorcas
when i returned with her however the boudoir was empty hercule_poirot i cried where are you i am here my friend
he had stepped outside the french window and was standing apparently lost in admiration before the various shaped flower beds
admirable he murmured admirable what symmetry observe that crescent and those diamonds their neatness rejoices the eye the spacing of the plants also is perfect
it has been recently done is it not so yes i believe they were at it yesterday afternoon but come in mademoiselle_dorcas is here
eh bien eh bien do not grudge me a moment satisfaction of the eye yes but this affair is more important
and how do you know that these fine begonias are not of equal importance i shrugged my shoulders there was really no arguing with him if he chose to take that line
you do not agree but such things have been well we will come in and interview the brave mademoiselle_dorcas
mademoiselle_dorcas was standing in the boudoir her hand folded in front of her and her grey hair rose in stiff waves under her white cap
she was the very model and picture of a good old fashioned servant in her attitude towards hercule_poirot she was inclined to be suspicious but he soon broke down her defences
he drew forward a chair pray be seated mademoiselle_cynthia thank you sir you have been with your mistress many year is it not so
ten year sir that is a long time and very faithful service you were much attached to her were you not
she was a very good mistress to me sir then you will not object to answering a few questions i put them to you with mr_john_cavendish full approval
oh certainly sir then i will begin by asking you about the events of yesterday afternoon your mistress had a quarrel
yes sir but i dont know that i ought mademoiselle_dorcas hesitated hercule_poirot looked at her keenly my good mademoiselle_dorcas it is necessary that i should know every detail of that quarrel as fully as possible
do not think that you are betraying your mistress secrets your mistress lies dead and it is necessary that we should know all if we are to avenge her
nothing can bring her back to life but we do hope if there has been foul play to bring the murderer to justice
amen to that said mademoiselle_dorcas fiercely and naming no names there one in this house that none of us could ever abide
and an ill day it was when first he darkened the threshold hercule_poirot waited for her indignation to subside and then resuming his business like tone he asked
now as to this quarrel what is the first you heard of it well sir i happened to be going along the hall outside yesterday
what time was that i couldnt say exactly sir but it wasnt tea time by a long way perhaps four clock or it may have been a bit later
well sir as i said i happened to be passing along when i heard voices very loud and angry in here
the door was shut but the mistress was speaking very sharp and clear and i heard what she said quite plainly
i didnt exactly mean to listen but well there it is i stopped you have lied to me and deceived me she said
i didnt hear what mr mrs_inglethorp replied he spoke a good bit lower than she did but she answered how dare you
i have kept you and clothed you and fed you you owe everything to me and this is how you repay me
by bringing disgrace upon our name again i didnt hear what he said but she went on nothing that you can say will make any difference
i see my duty clearly my mind is made up you need not think that any fear of publicity or scandal between husband and wife will deter me
then i thought i heard them coming out so i went off quickly you are sure it was mr mrs_inglethorp voice you heard
oh yes sir whose else could it be well what happened next later i came back to the hall but it was all quiet
at five clock mrs_inglethorp rang the bell and told me to bring her a cup of tea nothing to eat to the boudoir
she was looking dreadful so white and upset mademoiselle_dorcas she says i ve had a great shock i sorry for that m i says
i dont know if it was a letter or just a piece of paper but it had writing on it and she kept staring at it almost as if she couldnt believe what was written there
you ll feel better after a nice hot cup of tea m she had something in her hand she whispered to herself as though she had forgotten i was there these few words and everything changed
i hurried off and got her a good strong cup of tea and she thanked me and said she feel better when she drunk it
and then she says to me never trust a man mademoiselle_dorcas they re not worth it i dont know what to do she says
scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing mademoiselle_dorcas i rather hush it up if i could mrs mr_john_cavendish came in just then so she didnt say any more
she still had the letter or whatever it was in her hand yes sir what would she be likely to do with it afterwards
well i dont know sir i expect she would lock it up in that purple case of hers is that where she usually kept important paper
yes sir she brought it down with her every morning and took it up every night when did she lose the key of it
she missed it yesterday at lunch time sir and told me to look carefully for it she was very much put out about it
but she had a duplicate key oh yes sir mademoiselle_dorcas was looking very curiously at him and to tell the truth so was i
what was all this about a lost key hercule_poirot smiled never mind mademoiselle_dorcas it is my business to know things
is this the key that was lost he drew from his pocket the key that he had found in the lock of the despatch case upstairs
mademoiselle_dorcas eyes looked as though they would pop out of her head that it sir right enough but where did you find it
i looked everywhere for it ah but you see it was not in the same place yesterday as it was to day
now to pass to another subject had your mistress a dark green dress in her wardrobe mademoiselle_dorcas was rather startled by the unexpected question
no sir are you quite sure oh yes sir has anyone else in the house got a green dress
mademoiselle_dorcas reflected miss mademoiselle_cynthia has a green evening dress light or dark green a light green sir a sort of chiffon they call it
ah that is not what i want and nobody else has anything green no sir not that i know of
hercule_poirot face did not betray a trace of whether he was disappointed or otherwise he merely remarked good we will leave that and pass on
have you any reason to believe that your mistress was likely to take a sleeping powder last night not last night sir i know she didnt
why do you know so positively because the box was empty she took the last one two day ago and she didnt have any more made up
you are quite sure of that positive sir then that is cleared up by the way your mistress didnt ask you to sign any paper yesterday
to sign a paper no sir when mr_hastings and mr monsieur_lawrence came in yesterday evening they found your mistress busy writing letters
i suppose you can give me no idea to whom these letters were addressed i afraid i couldnt sir i was out in the evening
perhaps annie could tell you though she a careless girl never cleared the coffee cups away last night that what happens when i not here to look after things
hercule_poirot lifted his hand since they have been left mademoiselle_dorcas leave them a little longer i pray you i should like to examine them
very well sir what time did you go out last evening about six clock sir thank you mademoiselle_dorcas that is all i have to ask you
he rose and strolled to the window i have been admiring these flower beds how many gardeners are employed here by the way
only three now sir five we had before the war when it was kept as a gentleman place should be
i wish you could have seen it then sir a fair sight it was but now there only old manning and young william and a new fashioned woman gardener in breeches and such like
ah these are dreadful time the good time will come again mademoiselle_dorcas at least we hope so now will you send annie to me here
yes sir thank you sir how did you know that mrs_inglethorp took sleeping powders i asked in lively curiosity as mademoiselle_dorcas left the room
and about the lost key and the duplicate one thing at a time as to the sleeping powders i knew by this
he suddenly produced a small cardboard box such as chemists use for powders where did you find it
in the wash stand drawer in mrs_inglethorp bedroom it was number six of my catalogue but i suppose as the last powder was taken two day ago it is not of much importance
probably not but do you notice anything that strikes you as peculiar about this box i examined it closely
no i cant say that i do look at the label i read the label carefully one powder to be taken at bedtime if required
mrs_inglethorp no i see nothing unusual not the fact that there is no chemist name ah i exclaimed
to be sure that is odd have you ever known a chemist to send out a box like that without his printed name
no i cant say that i have i was becoming quite excited but hercule_poirot damped my ardour by remarking
yet the explanation is quite simple so do not intrigue yourself my friend an audible creaking proclaimed the approach of annie so i had no time to reply
annie was a fine strapping girl and was evidently labouring under intense excitement mingled with a certain ghoulish enjoyment of the tragedy
i sent for you annie because i thought you might be able to tell me something about the letters mrs_inglethorp wrote last night
hercule_poirot came to the point at once with a business like briskness how many were there and can you tell me any of the names and addresses
one was to miss_howard and one was to mr_wells the lawyer and the other two i dont think i remember sir oh yes one was to ross the caterers in tadminster
annie considered there were four letters sir the other one i dont remember think urged hercule_poirot annie racked her brains in vain
i sorry sir but it clean gone i dont think i can have noticed it it does not matter said hercule_poirot not betraying any sign of disappointment
now i want to ask you about something else there is a saucepan in mrs_inglethorp room with some cocoa in it
yes sir it was put in her room every evening and she warmed it up in the night whenever she fancied it
did she have that every night what was it plain cocoa yes sir made with milk with a teaspoonful of sugar and two teaspoonfuls of rum in it
who took it to her room i did sir always yes sir at what time when i went to draw the curtains as a rule sir
no sir you see there not much room on the gas stove so cook used to make it early before putting the vegetables on for supper
then i used to bring it up and put it on the table by the swing door and take it into her room later
did you bring it straight up from the kitchen then the swing door is in the left wing is it not
yes sir and the table is it on this side of the door or on the farther servants side
it this side sir what time did you bring it up last night about quarter past seven i should say sir
and when did you take it into mrs_inglethorp room when i went to shut up sir about eight clock
mrs_inglethorp came up to bed before i finished then between and clock the cocoa was standing on the table in the left wing
yes sir annie had been growing redder and redder in the face and now she blurted out unexpectedly and if there was salt in it sir it wasnt me
i never took the salt near it what makes you think there was salt in it asked hercule_poirot seeing it on the tray sir
i never noticed it when i took the tray up but when i came to take it into the mistress room i saw it at once and i suppose i ought to have taken it down again and asked cook to make some fresh
but i was in a hurry because mademoiselle_dorcas was out and i thought maybe the cocoa itself was all right and the salt had only gone on the tray
you saw some salt on the tray yes coarse kitchen salt it looked so i dusted it off with my apron and took it in
i had the utmost difficulty in controlling my excitement unknown to herself annie had provided us with an important piece of evidence
how she would have gaped if she had realized that her coarse kitchen salt was strychnine one of the most deadly poisons known to mankind
i marvelled at hercule_poirot calm his self control was astonishing i awaited his next question with impatience but it disappointed me
when you went into mrs_inglethorp room was the door leading into miss mademoiselle_cynthia room bolted oh yes sir it always was
it had never been opened and the door into mr mrs_inglethorp room did you notice if that was bolted too
annie hesitated i couldnt rightly say sir it was shut but i couldnt say whether it was bolted or not
when you finally left the room did mrs_inglethorp bolt the door after you no sir not then but i expect she did later
she usually did lock it at night the door into the passage that is did you notice any candle grease on the floor when you did the room yesterday
then if there had been a large patch of candle grease on the floor you think you would have been sure to have seen it
candle grease oh no sir mrs_inglethorp didnt have a candle only a reading lamp yes sir and i would have taken it out with a piece of blotting paper and a hot iron
then hercule_poirot repeated the question he had put to mademoiselle_dorcas did your mistress ever have a green dress no sir
nor a mantle nor a cape nor a how do you call it a sports coat not green sir nor anyone else in the house
annie reflected no sir you are sure of that quite sure bien that is all i want to know
thank you very much with a nervous giggle annie took herself creakingly out of the room my pent up excitement burst forth
hercule_poirot i cried i congratulate you this is a great discovery what is a great discovery why that it was the cocoa and not the coffee that was poisoned
of course it did not take effect until the early morning since the cocoa was only drunk in the middle of the night
that explains everything so you think that the cocoa mark well what i say mr_hastings the cocoa contained strychnine of course
that salt on the tray what else could it have been it might have been salt replied hercule_poirot placidly i shrugged my shoulders
if he was going to take the matter that way it was no good arguing with him the idea crossed my mind not for the first time that poor old hercule_poirot was growing old
privately i thought it lucky that he had associated with him someone of a more receptive type of mind hercule_poirot was surveying me with quietly twinkling eyes
you are not pleased with me mon ami my dear hercule_poirot i said coldly it is not for me to dictate to you
you have a right to your own opinion just as i have to mine a most admirable sentiment remarked hercule_poirot rising briskly to his feet
now i have finished with this room by the way whose is the smaller desk in the corner mr mrs_inglethorp
ah he tried the roll top tentatively locked but perhaps one of mrs_inglethorp keys would open it he tried several twisting and turning them with a practiced hand and finally uttering an ejaculation of satisfaction
voilà it is not the key but it will open it at a pinch he slid back the roll top and ran a rapid eye over the neatly filed paper
to my surprise he did not examine them merely remarking approvingly as he relocked the desk decidedly he is a man of method this mr mrs_inglethorp
i felt that my friend was not what he had been as he rambled on disconnectedly there were no stamps in his desk but there might have been eh mon ami
a man of method was in hercule_poirot estimation the highest praise that could be bestowed on any individual there might have been
yes his eyes wandered round the room this boudoir has nothing more to tell us it did not yield much only this
he pulled a crumpled envelope out of his pocket and tossed it over to me it was rather a curious document
a plain dirty looking old envelope with a few words scrawled across it apparently at random the following is a facsimile of it
chapter it isnt strychnine is it where did you find this i asked hercule_poirot in lively curiosity in the waste paper basket
you recognise the handwriting yes it is mrs_inglethorp but what does it mean hercule_poirot shrugged his shoulders i cannot say but it is suggestive
a wild idea flashed across me was it possible that mrs_inglethorp mind was deranged had she some fantastic idea of demoniacal possession
and if that were so was it not also possible that she might have taken her own life i was about to expound these theories to hercule_poirot when his own words distracted me
come he said now to examine the coffee cups my dear hercule_poirot what on earth is the good of that now that we know about the cocoa
he laughed with apparent enjoyment raising his arms to heaven in mock despair in what i could not but consider the worst possible taste
and anyway i said with increasing coldness as mrs_inglethorp took her coffee upstairs with her i do not see what you expect to find unless you consider it likely that we shall discover a packet of strychnine on the coffee tray
oh là là that miserable cocoa cried hercule_poirot flippantly hercule_poirot was sobered at once come come my friend he said slipping his arms through mine
ne vous fâchez pas allow me to interest myself in my coffee cups and i will respect your cocoa there is it a bargain
he was so quaintly humorous that i was forced to laugh and we went together to the drawing room where the coffee cups and tray remained undisturbed as we had left them
hercule_poirot made me recapitulate the scene of the night before listening very carefully and verifying the position of the various cups
so mrs mr_john_cavendish stood by the tray and poured out yes then she came across to the window where you sat with mademoiselle_cynthia
yes here are the three cups and the cup on the mantel piece half drunk that would be mr monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish and the one on the tray
mr_john_cavendish i saw him put it down there good one two three four five but where then is the cup of mr mrs_inglethorp
with infinite care he took a drop or two from the grounds in each cup sealing them up in separate test tubes tasting each in turn as he did so
he does not take coffee then all are accounted for one moment my friend his physiognomy underwent a curious change
an expression gathered there that i can only describe as half puzzled and half relieved bien he said at last
it is evident i had an idea but clearly i was mistaken yes altogether i was mistaken yet it is strange
but no matter and with a characteristic shrug he dismissed whatever it was that was worrying him from his mind
i could have told him from the beginning that this obsession of his over the coffee was bound to end in a blind alley but i restrained my tongue
after all though he was old hercule_poirot had been a great man in his day breakfast is ready said mr_john_cavendish coming in from the hall
you will breakfast with us monsieur hercule_poirot hercule_poirot acquiesced i observed mr_john_cavendish already he was almost restored to his normal self
the shock of the events of the last night had upset him temporarily but his equable poise soon swung back to the normal
ever since the early hours of the morning mr_john_cavendish had been hard at work sending telegrams one of the first had gone to evelyn_howard writing notices for the paper and generally occupying himself with the melancholy duties that a death entails
he was a man of very little imagination in sharp contrast with his brother who had perhaps too much may i ask how things are proceeding he said
i think mr_john_cavendish said hercule_poirot gravely that you would do well not to buoy yourself up with any false hopes
do your investigations point to my mother having died a natural death or or must we prepare ourselves for the worst can you tell me the view of the other members of the family
my brother monsieur_lawrence is convinced that we are making a fuss over nothing he says that everything points to its being a simple case of heart failure
he does does he that is very interesting very interesting murmured hercule_poirot softly and mrs mr_john_cavendish a faint cloud passed over mr_john_cavendish face
i have not the least idea what my wife view on the subject are the answer brought a momentary stiffness in its train
mr_john_cavendish broke the rather awkward silence by saying with a slight effort i told you didnt i that mr mrs_inglethorp has returned
of course one has to treat him as usual but hang it all one gorge does rise at sitting down to eat with a possible murderer
hercule_poirot bent his head it an awkward position for all of us hercule_poirot nodded sympathetically i quite understand it is a very difficult situation for you mr_john_cavendish
i would like to ask you one question mr mrs_inglethorp reason for not returning last night was i believe that he had forgotten the latch key
is not that so yes i suppose you are quite sure that the latch key was forgotten that he did not take it after all
i have no idea i never thought of looking we always keep it in the hall drawer i ll go and see if it there now
hercule_poirot held up his hand with a faint smile no no mr_john_cavendish it is too late now i am certain that you would find it
if mr mrs_inglethorp did take it he has had ample time to replace it by now but do you think i think nothing
if anyone had chanced to look this morning before his return and seen it there it would have been a valuable point in his favour
that is all mr_john_cavendish looked perplexed do not worry said hercule_poirot smoothly i assure you that you need not let it trouble you
since you are so kind let us go and have some breakfast every one was assembled in the dining room under the circumstances we were naturally not a cheerful party
decorum and good breeding naturally enjoined that our demeanour should be much as usual yet i could not help wondering if this self control were really a matter of great difficulty
the reaction after a shock is always trying and i think we were all suffering from it there were no red eyes no signs of secretly indulged grief
i felt that i was right in my opinion that mademoiselle_dorcas was the person most affected by the personal side of the tragedy
i pass over mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp who acted the bereaved widower in a manner that i felt to be disgusting in its hypocrisy
did he know that we suspected him i wondered surely he could not be unaware of the fact conceal it as we would
did he feel some secret stirring of fear or was he confident that his crime would go unpunished surely the suspicion in the atmosphere must warn him that he was already a marked man
but did every one suspect him what about mrs mr_john_cavendish i watched her as she sat at the head of the table graceful composed enigmatic
in her soft grey frock with white ruffles at the wrists falling over her slender hand she looked very beautiful when she chose however her face could be sphinx like in its inscrutability
she was very silent hardly opening her lips and yet in some queer way i felt that the great strength of her personality was dominating us all
and little mademoiselle_cynthia did she suspect she looked very tired and ill i thought the heaviness and languor of her manner were very marked
i asked her if she were feeling ill and she answered frankly yes i ve got the most beastly headache have another cup of coffee mademoiselle_cynthia said hercule_poirot solicitously
it will revive you it is unparalleled for the mal de tête he jumped up and took her cup
no sugar said mademoiselle_cynthia watching him as he picked up the sugar tongs no sugar you abandon it in the war time eh
no i never take it in coffee sacré murmured hercule_poirot to himself as he brought back the replenished cup
only i heard him and glancing up curiously at the little man i saw that his face was working with suppressed excitement and his eyes were as green as a cat
i do not usually label myself as dense but i must confess that nothing out of the ordinary had attracted my attention
he had heard or seen something that had affected him strongly but what was it in another moment the door opened and mademoiselle_dorcas appeared
mr_wells to see you sir she said to mr_john_cavendish i remembered the name as being that of the lawyer to whom mrs_inglethorp had written the night before
mr_john_cavendish rose immediately show him into my study then he turned to us my mother lawyer he explained and in a lower voice he is also coroner you understand
perhaps you would like to come with me we acquiesced and followed him out of the room mr_john_cavendish strode on ahead
and i took the opportunity of whispering to hercule_poirot there will be an inquest then hercule_poirot nodded absently he seemed absorbed in thought so much so that my curiosity was aroused
what is it you are not attending to what i say it is true my friend i am much worried
why because mademoiselle_cynthia does not take sugar in her coffee what you cannot be serious
but i am most serious ah there is something there that i do not understand my instinct was right
what instinct the instinct that led me to insist on examining those coffee cups chut no more now we followed mr_john_cavendish into his study and he closed the door behind us
mr_wells was a pleasant man of middle age with keen eyes and the typical lawyer mouth mr_john_cavendish introduced us both and explained the reason of our presence
you will understand mr_wells he added that this is all strictly private we are still hoping that there will turn out to be no need for investigation of any kind
i wish we could have spared you the pain and publicity of an inquest but of course it quite unavoidable in the absence of a doctor certificate
quite so quite so said mr_wells soothingly yes i suppose so clever man dr_bauerstein great authority on toxicology
i believe indeed said mr_john_cavendish with a certain stiffness in his manner then he added rather hesitatingly shall we have to appear as witness all of us i mean
a slight pause ensued before the lawyer went on in his soothing manner any other evidence will be simply confirmatory a mere matter of form
you of course and ah er mr er mrs_inglethorp i see a faint expression of relief swept over mr_john_cavendish face it puzzled me for i saw no occasion for it
if you know of nothing to the contrary pursued mr_wells i had thought of friday that will give us plenty of time for the doctor report
the post mortem is to take place to night i believe yes then that arrangement will suit you perfectly i need not tell you my dear mr_john_cavendish how distressed i am at this most tragic affair
can you give us no help in solving it monsieur interposed hercule_poirot speaking for the first time since we had entered the room
i yes we heard that mrs_inglethorp wrote to you last night you should have received the letter this morning i did but it contains no information
it is merely a note asking me to call upon her this morning as she wanted my advice on a matter of great importance
she gave you no hint as to what that matter might be unfortunately no that is a pity said mr_john_cavendish
a great pity agreed hercule_poirot gravely there was silence hercule_poirot remained lost in thought for a few minutes finally he turned to the lawyer again
mr_wells there is one thing i should like to ask you that is if it is not against professional etiquette
the lawyer hesitated a moment and then replied the knowledge will be public property very soon so if mr_john_cavendish does not object not at all interpolated mr_john_cavendish
in the event of mrs_inglethorp death who would inherit her money i do not see any reason why i should not answer your question
by her last will dated august of last year after various unimportant legacies to servants etc she gave her entire fortune to her stepson mr_john_cavendish
was not that pardon the question mr_john_cavendish rather unfair to her other stepson mr monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish no i do not think so
you see under the terms of their father will while mr_john_cavendish inherited the property monsieur_lawrence at his stepmother death would come into a considerable sum of money
mrs_inglethorp left her money to her elder stepson knowing that he would have to keep up styles it was to my mind a very fair and equitable distribution
but i am right in saying am i not that by your english law that will was automatically revoked when mrs_inglethorp remarried
hercule_poirot nodded thoughtfully i see mr_wells bowed his head as i was about to proceed monsieur hercule_poirot that document is now null and void
hein said hercule_poirot he reflected for a moment and then asked was mrs_inglethorp herself aware of that fact
i do not know she may have been she was said mr_john_cavendish unexpectedly we were discussing the matter of wills being revoked by marriage only yesterday
ah one more question mr_wells you say her last will had mrs_inglethorp then made several former wills on an average she made a new will at least once a year said mr_wells imperturbably
she was given to changing her mind as to her testamentary dispositions now benefiting one now another member of her family
suppose suggested hercule_poirot that unknown to you she had made a new will in favour of someone who was not in any sense of the word a member of the family we will say miss_howard for instance would you be surprised
not in the least ah hercule_poirot seemed to have exhausted his questions i drew close to him while mr_john_cavendish and the lawyer were debating the question of going through mrs_inglethorp paper
do you think mrs_inglethorp made a will leaving all her money to miss_howard i asked in a low voice with some curiosity
hercule_poirot smiled no then why did you ask hush mr_john_cavendish had turned to hercule_poirot will you come with us monsieur hercule_poirot
we are going through my mother paper mr mrs_inglethorp is quite willing to leave it entirely to mr_wells and myself
which simplifies matters very much murmured the lawyer as technically of course he was entitled he did not finish the sentence
we will look through the desk in the boudoir first explained mr_john_cavendish and go up to her bedroom afterwards she kept her most important paper in a purple despatch case which we must look through carefully
yes said the lawyer it is quite possible that there may be a later will than the one in my possession
there is a later will it was hercule_poirot who spoke what mr_john_cavendish and the lawyer looked at him startled
or rather pursued my friend imperturbably there was one what do you mean there was one where is it now
he took out the charred fragment we had found in the grate in mrs_inglethorp room and handed it to the lawyer with a brief explanation of when and where he had found it
burnt burnt yes see here but possibly this is an old will i do not think so in fact i am almost certain that it was made no earlier than yesterday afternoon
what impossible broke simultaneously from both man hercule_poirot turned to mr_john_cavendish if you will allow me to send for your gardener i will prove it to you
oh of course but i dont see hercule_poirot raised his hand do as i ask you afterwards you shall question as much as you please
very well he rang the bell mademoiselle_dorcas answered it in due course mademoiselle_dorcas will you tell manning to come round and speak to me here
yes sir mademoiselle_dorcas withdrew we waited in a tense silence hercule_poirot alone seemed perfectly at his ease and dusted a forgotten corner of the bookcase
the clumping of hobnailed boots on the gravel outside proclaimed the approach of manning mr_john_cavendish looked questioningly at hercule_poirot the latter nodded
come inside manning said mr_john_cavendish i want to speak to you manning came slowly and hesitatingly through the french window and stood as near it as he could
his back was much bent though he was probably not as old as he looked but his eyes were sharp and intelligent and belied his slow and rather cautious speech
he held his cap in his hand twisting it very carefully round and round manning said mr_john_cavendish this gentleman will put some questions to you which i want you to answer
you were planting a bed of begonias round by the south side of the house yesterday afternoon were you not manning
yes sir mumbled manning hercule_poirot stepped forward briskly manning eye swept over him with a faint contempt yes sir me and willum
and mrs_inglethorp came to the window and called you did she not yes sir she did tell me in your own words exactly what happened after that
she just told willum to go on his bicycle down to the village and bring back a form of will or such like
well sir nothing much i dont know what exactly she wrote it down for him well well he did sir
and what happened next we went on with the begonias sir did not mrs_inglethorp call you again yes sir both me and willum she called
she made us come right in and sign our names at the bottom of a long paper under where she signed
and then did you see anything of what was written above her signature asked hercule_poirot sharply no sir there was a bit of blotting paper over that part
and you signed where she told you yes sir first me and then willum what did she do with it afterwards
well sir she slipped it into a long envelope and put it inside a sort of purple box that was standing on the desk
what time was it when she first called you about four i should say sir not earlier
couldnt it have been about half past three no i shouldnt say so sir it would be more likely to be a bit after four not before it
the gardener glanced at his master who nodded whereupon manning lifted a finger to his forehead with a low mumble and backed cautiously out of the window
thank you manning that will do said hercule_poirot pleasantly we all looked at each other good heavens murmured mr_john_cavendish
what an extraordinary coincidence how a coincidence that my mother should have made a will on the very day of her death
mr_wells cleared his throat and remarked drily are you so sure it is a coincidence mr_john_cavendish what do you mean
your mother you tell me had a violent quarrel with someone yesterday afternoon what do you mean cried mr_john_cavendish again
there was a tremor in his voice and he had gone very pale in consequence of that quarrel your mother very suddenly and hurriedly makes a new will
the contents of that will we shall never know she told no one of its provisions this morning no doubt she would have consulted me on the subject but she had no chance
the will disappears and she takes its secret with her to her grave mr_john_cavendish i much fear there is no coincidence there
monsieur hercule_poirot i am sure you agree with me that the facts are very suggestive suggestive or not interrupted mr_john_cavendish we are most grateful to monsieur hercule_poirot for elucidating the matter
but for him we should never have known of this will i suppose i may not ask you monsieur what first led you to suspect the fact
mr_john_cavendish i think would have pressed his questions further but at that moment the loud purr of a motor was audible and we all turned to the window as it swept past
hercule_poirot smiled and answered a scribbled over old envelope and a freshly planted bed of begonias evie cried mr_john_cavendish
excuse me mr_wells he went hurriedly out into the hall hercule_poirot looked inquiringly at me miss_howard i explained
ah i am glad she has come there is a woman with a head and a heart too mr_hastings though the good god gave her no beauty
i followed mr_john_cavendish example and went out into the hall where miss_howard was endeavouring to extricate herself from the voluminous mass of veils that enveloped her head
as her eyes fell on me a sudden pang of guilt shot through me this was the woman who had warned me so earnestly and to whose warning i had alas paid no heed
how soon and how contemptuously i had dismissed it from my mind now that she had been proved justified in so tragic a manner i felt ashamed
i wondered whether if she had remained at styles the tragedy would have taken place or would the man have feared her watchful eyes
she had known mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp only too well i was relieved when she shook me by the hand with her well remembered painful grip
the eyes that met mine were sad but not reproachful that she had been crying bitterly i could tell by the redness of her eyelids but her manner was unchanged from its old gruffness
started the moment i got the wire just come off night duty hired car quickest way to get here
have you had anything to eat this morning evie asked mr_john_cavendish no i thought not come along breakfast not cleared away yet and they ll make you some fresh tea
he turned to me look after her mr_hastings will you mr_wells is waiting for me oh here monsieur hercule_poirot
he helping us you know evie miss_howard shook hand with hercule_poirot but glanced suspiciously over her shoulder at mr_john_cavendish
what do you mean helping us helping us to investigate nothing to investigate have they taken him to prison yet
taken who to prison who mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp of course my dear evie do be careful monsieur_lawrence is of the opinion that my mother died from heart seizure
more fool monsieur_lawrence retorted miss_howard of course mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp murdered poor emily as i always told you he would
my dear evie dont shout so whatever we may think or suspect it is better to say as little as possible for the present
the inquest isnt until friday not until fiddlesticks the snort miss_howard gave was truly magnificent you re all off your heads
the man will be out of the country by then if he any sense he wont stay here tamely and wait to be hanged
mr_john_cavendish looked at her helplessly i know what it is she accused him you ve been listening to the doctors
never should what do they know nothing at all or just enough to make them dangerous i ought to know my own father was a doctor
that little dr_wilkins is about the greatest fool that even i have ever seen heart seizure sort of thing he would say
anyone with any sense could see at once that her husband had poisoned her i always said he murder her in her bed poor soul
now he done it and all you can do is to murmur silly things about heart seizure and inquest on friday
you ought to be ashamed of yourself mr_john_cavendish what do you want me to do asked mr_john_cavendish unable to help a faint smile
dash it all evie i cant haul him down to the local police station by the scruff of his neck
well you might do something find out how he did it he a crafty beggar dare say he soaked fly paper
it occurred to me very forcibly at that moment that to harbour miss_howard and mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp under the same roof and keep the peace between them was likely to prove a herculean task and i did not envy mr_john_cavendish
ask cook if she missed any i could see by the expression of his face that he fully appreciated the difficulty of the position
as she left the room hercule_poirot came over from the window where he had been standing and sat down facing miss_howard
for the moment he sought refuge in retreat and left the room precipitately mademoiselle_dorcas brought in fresh tea mademoiselle_cynthia he said gravely i want to ask you something
ask away said the lady eyeing him with some disfavour i want to be able to count upon your help
i ll help you to hang mr_alfred_inglethorp with pleasure she replied gruffly hanging too good for him ought to be drawn and quartered like in good old time
we are at one then said hercule_poirot for i too want to hang the criminal mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp him or another
no question of another poor emily was never murdered until he came along i dont say she wasnt surrounded by sharks she was
but it was only her purse they were after her life was safe enough but along comes mr mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp and within two months hey presto
believe me miss_howard said hercule_poirot very earnestly if mr mrs_inglethorp is the man he shall not escape me on my honour i will hang him as high as haman
that better said miss_howard more enthusiastically but i must ask you to trust me now your help may be very valuable to me
i will tell you why because in all this house of mourning yours are the only eyes that have wept
miss_howard blinked and a new note crept into the gruffness of her voice if you mean that i was fond of her yes i was
you know emily was a selfish old woman in her way she was very generous but she always wanted a return
she never let people forget what she had done for them and that way she missed love dont think she ever realized it though or felt the lack of it
hope not anyway i was on a different footing i took my stand from the first so many pounds a year
i worth to you well and good but not a penny piece besides not a pair of gloves nor a theatre ticket
she didnt understand was very offended sometimes said i was foolishly proud it wasnt that but i couldnt explain anyway i kept my self respect
and so out of the whole bunch i was the only one who could allow myself to be fond of her
i watched over her i guarded her from the lot of them and then a glib tongued scoundrel comes along and pooh
all my year of devotion go for nothing hercule_poirot nodded sympathetically i understand mademoiselle_cynthia i understand all you feel
it is most natural you think that we are lukewarm that we lack fire and energy but trust me it is not so
mr_john_cavendish stuck his head in at this juncture and invited us both to come up to mrs_inglethorp room as he and mr_wells had finished looking through the desk in the boudoir
as we went up the stairs mr_john_cavendish looked back to the dining room door and lowered his voice confidentially look here what going to happen when these two meet
i shook my head helplessly i ve told mary_cavendish to keep them apart if she can will she be able to do so
the lord only knows there one thing mrs_inglethorp himself wont be too keen on meeting her you ve got the keys still havent you hercule_poirot
i asked as we reached the door of the locked room taking the keys from hercule_poirot mr_john_cavendish unlocked it and we all passed in
the lawyer went straight to the desk and mr_john_cavendish followed him my mother kept most of her important paper in this despatch case i believe he said
hercule_poirot drew out the small bunch of keys permit me i locked it out of precaution this morning but it not locked now
impossible see and mr_john_cavendish lifted the lid as he spoke milles tonnerres cried hercule_poirot dumfounded and i who have both the keys in my pocket
he flung himself upon the case suddenly he stiffened eh voilà une affaire this lock has been forced what hercule_poirot laid down the case again
but who forced it why should they when but the door was locked these exclamations burst from us disjointedly
hercule_poirot answered them categorically almost mechanically who that is the question why ah if i only knew when since i was here an hour ago
as to the door being locked it is a very ordinary lock probably any other of the doorkeys in this passage would fit it
he was outwardly calm but i noticed his hand which from long force of habit were mechanically straightening the spill vases on the mantel piece were shaking violently
we stared at one another blankly hercule_poirot had walked over to the mantel piece see here it was like this he said at last
there was something in that case some piece of evidence slight in itself perhaps but still enough of a clue to connect the murderer with the crime
it was vital to him that it should be destroyed before it was discovered and its significance appreciated therefore he took the risk the great risk of coming in here
finding the case locked he was obliged to force it thus betraying his presence for him to take that risk it must have been something of great importance
but what was it ah cried hercule_poirot with a gesture of anger that i do not know a document of some kind without doubt possibly the scrap of paper mademoiselle_dorcas saw in her hand yesterday afternoon
and i his anger burst forth freely miserable animal that i am i guessed nothing i have behaved like an imbecile i should never have left that case here
i should have carried it away with me ah triple pig and now it is gone it is destroyed but is it destroyed
he rushed like a madman from the room and i followed him as soon as i had sufficiently recovered my wits
is there not yet a chance we must leave no stone unturned but by the time i had reached the top of the stairs he was out of sight
mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish was standing where the staircase branched staring down into the hall in the direction in which he had disappeared
what has happened to your extraordinary little friend mr_hastings he has just rushed past me like a mad bull
he rather upset about something i remarked feebly i really did not know how much hercule_poirot would wish me to disclose
as i saw a faint smile gather on mrs mr_john_cavendish expressive mouth i endeavoured to try and turn the conversation by saying they havent met yet have they
who mr mrs_inglethorp and miss_howard she looked at me in rather a disconcerting manner do you think it would be such a disaster if they did meet
well dont you i said rather taken aback no she was smiling in her quiet way i should like to see a good flare up
it would clear the air at present we are all thinking so much and saying so little mr_john_cavendish doesnt think so i remarked
he anxious to keep them apart oh mr_john_cavendish something in her tone fired me and i blurted out old mr_john_cavendish an awfully good sort
she studied me curiously for a minute or two and then said to my great surprise you are loyal to your friend
i like you for that arent you my friend too i am a very bad friend why do you say that
because it is true i am charming to my friend one day and forget all about them the next
i dont know what impelled me but i was nettled and i said foolishly and not in the best of taste
yet you seem to be invariably charming to dr_bauerstein instantly i regretted my words her face stiffened i had the impression of a steel curtain coming down and blotting out the real woman
without a word she turned and went swiftly up the stairs whilst i stood like an idiot gaping after her i was recalled to other matters by a frightful row going on below
the little man appeared to be taking the whole house into his confidence a proceeding of which i for one doubted the wisdom
once again i could not help regretting that my friend was so prone to lose his head in moments of excitement
i could hear hercule_poirot shouting and expounding i was vexed to think that my diplomacy had been in vain i stepped briskly down the stairs
the sight of me calmed hercule_poirot almost immediately i drew him aside my dear fellow i said is this wise
surely you dont want the whole house to know of this occurrence you are actually playing into the criminal hand you think so mr_hastings
i am sure of it well well my friend i will be guided by you good although unfortunately it is a little too late now
he looked so crestfallen and abashed that i felt quite sorry though i still thought my rebuke a just and wise one
sure well he said at last let us go mon ami you have finished here for the moment yes
you will walk back with me to the village willingly he picked up his little suit case and we went out through the open window in the drawing room
mademoiselle_cynthia murdoch was just coming in and hercule_poirot stood aside to let her pass excuse me mademoiselle_cynthia one minute yes
she turned inquiringly did you ever make up mrs_inglethorp medicines a slight flush rose in her face as she answered rather constrainedly
no only her powders the flush deepened as mademoiselle_cynthia replied oh yes i did make up some sleeping powders for her once
these hercule_poirot produced the empty box which had contained powders she nodded can you tell me what they were sulphonal
veronal no they were bromide powders ah thank you mademoiselle_cynthia good morning as we walked briskly away from the house i glanced at him more than once
i had often before noticed that if anything excited him his eyes turned green like a cat they were shining like emeralds now
my friend he broke out at last i have a little idea a very strange and probably utterly impossible idea
and yet it fits in i shrugged my shoulders i privately thought that hercule_poirot was rather too much given to these fantastic ideas
in this case surely the truth was only too plain and apparent so that is the explanation of the blank label on the box i remarked
very simple as you said i really wonder that i did not think of it myself hercule_poirot did not appear to be listening to me
they have made one more discovery la bas he observed jerking his thumb over his shoulder in the direction of styles
locked up in the desk in the boudoir they found a will of mrs_inglethorp dated before her marriage leaving her fortune to mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp
mr_wells told me as we were going upstairs what was it it must have been made just at the time they were engaged
it came quite as a surprise to mr_wells and to mr_john_cavendish also it was written on one of those printed will forms and witnessed by two of the servants not mademoiselle_dorcas
did mr mrs_inglethorp know of it he says not one might take that with a grain of salt i remarked sceptically
tell me how did those scribbled words on the envelope help you to discover that a will was made yesterday afternoon
mon ami have you ever when writing a letter been arrested by the fact that you did not know how to spell a certain word
and have you not in such a case tried the word once or twice on the edge of the blotting paper or a spare scrap of paper to see if it looked right
all these wills are very confusing hercule_poirot smiled yes often i suppose every one has exactly well that is what mrs_inglethorp did
you will notice that the word possessed is spelt first with one and subsequently with two correctly to make sure she had further tried it in a sentence thus i am possessed
it told me that mrs_inglethorp had been writing the word possessed that afternoon and having the fragment of paper found in the grate fresh in my mind the possibility of a will a document almost certain to contain that word occurred to me at once
in the general confusion the boudoir had not been swept that morning and near the desk were several traces of brown mould and earth
now what did that tell me this possibility was confirmed by a further circumstance the weather had been perfectly fine for some day and no ordinary boots would have left such a heavy deposit
the mould in the beds was exactly similar to that on the floor of the boudoir and also i learnt from you that they had been planted yesterday afternoon
i was now sure that one or possibly both of the gardeners for there were two sets of footprints in the bed had entered the boudoir for if mrs_inglethorp had merely wished to speak to them she would in all probability have stood at the window and they would not have come into the room at all
i was now quite convinced that she had made a fresh will and had called the two gardeners in to witness her signature
i strolled to the window and saw at once that the begonia beds had been newly planted events proved that i was right in my supposition
that was very ingenious i could not help admitting i must confess that the conclusions i drew from those few scribbled words were quite erroneous
he smiled you gave too much rein to your imagination imagination is a good servant and a bad master
the simplest explanation is always the most likely another point how did you know that the key of the despatch case had been lost
i did not know it it was a guess that turned out to be correct you observed that it had a piece of twisted wire through the handle
now if it had been lost and recovered mrs_inglethorp would at once have replaced it on her bunch but on her bunch i found what was obviously the duplicate key very new and bright which led me to the hypothesis that somebody else had inserted the original key in the lock of the despatch case
that suggested to me at once that it had possibly been wrenched off a flimsy key ring yes i said mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp without doubt
hercule_poirot looked at me curiously you are very sure of his guilt well naturally every fresh circumstance seems to establish it more clearly
on the contrary said hercule_poirot quietly there are several points in his favour oh come now yes i see only one
and that that he was not in the house last night bad shot as you english say you have chosen the one point that to my mind tells against him
because if mr mrs_inglethorp knew that his wife would be poisoned last night he would certainly have arranged to be away from the house
how is that his excuse was an obviously trumped up one that leaves us two possibilities either he knew what was going to happen
or he had a reason of his own for his absence and that reason i asked sceptically hercule_poirot shrugged his shoulders
how should i know discreditable without doubt this mr mrs_inglethorp i should say is somewhat of a scoundrel but that does not of necessity make him a murderer
i shook my head unconvinced we do not agree eh said hercule_poirot well let us leave it time will show which of us is right
now let us turn to other aspects of the case what do you make of the fact that all the doors of the bedroom were bolted on the inside
the doors were bolted our own eyes have told us that yet the presence of the candle grease on the floor and the destruction of the will prove that during the night someone entered the room
well i considered one must look at it logically true i should put it this way you agree so far
well i said encouraged as the person who entered did not do so by the window nor by miraculous means it follows that the door must have been opened from inside by mrs_inglethorp herself
perfectly put with admirable clearness proceed that strengthens the conviction that the person in question was her husband
she had bolted the door leading into his room a most unusual proceeding on her part she had had a most violent quarrel with him that very afternoon
she would naturally open the door to her own husband hercule_poirot shook his head why should she no he was the last person she would admit
but you agree with me that the door must have been opened by mrs_inglethorp herself there is another possibility
she may have forgotten to bolt the door into the passage when she went to bed and have got up later towards morning and bolted it then
now to turn to another feature what do you make of the scrap of conversation you overheard between mrs mr_john_cavendish and her mother in law
hercule_poirot is that seriously your opinion no i do not say it is so but it might be i had forgotten that i said thoughtfully
it seems incredible that a woman like mrs mr_john_cavendish proud and reticent to the last degree should interfere so violently in what was certainly not her affair
that is as enigmatical as ever precisely it was an astonishing thing for a woman of her breeding to do
it is certainly curious i agreed still it is unimportant and need not be taken into account a groan burst from hercule_poirot
what have i always told you everything must be taken into account if the fact will not fit the theory let the theory go
well we shall see i said nettled yes we shall see we had reached leastways cottage and hercule_poirot ushered me upstairs to his own room
he offered me one of the tiny russian cigarettes he himself occasionally smoked i was amused to notice that he stowed away the used matches most carefully in a little china pot
my momentary annoyance vanished hercule_poirot had placed our two chairs in front of the open window which commanded a view of the village street
the fresh air blew in warm and pleasant it was going to be a hot day suddenly my attention was arrested by a weedy looking young man rushing down the street at a great pace
it was the expression on his face that was extraordinary a curious mingling of terror and agitation look hercule_poirot i said
he leant forward tiens he said it is mr_mace from the chemist shop he is coming here
the young man came to a halt before leastways cottage and after hesitating a moment pounded vigorously at the door
a little minute cried hercule_poirot from the window i come motioning to me to follow him he ran swiftly down the stairs and opened the door
mr_mace began at once oh mr hercule_poirot i sorry for the inconvenience but i heard that you just come back from the hall
yes we have the young man moistened his dry lips his face was working curiously it all over the village about old mrs_inglethorp dying so suddenly
they do say he lowered his voice cautiously that it poison hercule_poirot face remained quite impassive only the doctors can tell us that mr_mace
yes exactly of course the young man hesitated and then his agitation was too much for him he clutched hercule_poirot by the arm and sank his voice to a whisper
just tell me this mr hercule_poirot it isnt it isnt strychnine is it i hardly heard what hercule_poirot replied something evidently of a non committal nature
the young man departed and as he closed the door hercule_poirot eyes met mine yes he said nodding gravely
he will have evidence to give at the inquest we went slowly upstairs again i was opening my lips when hercule_poirot stopped me with a gesture of his hand
not now not now mon ami i have need of reflection my mind is in some disorder which is not well
for about ten minutes he sat in dead silence perfectly still except for several expressive motions of his eyebrows and all the time his eyes grew steadily greener
at last he heaved a deep sigh it is well the bad moment has passed now all is arranged and classified
one must never permit confusion the case is not clear yet no for it is of the most complicated it puzzles me
me hercule_poirot there are two facts of significance and what are they the first is the state of the weather yesterday
that is very important but it was a glorious day i interrupted hercule_poirot you re pulling my leg not at all
the thermometer registered degrees in the shade do not forget that my friend it is the key to the whole riddle
and the second point i asked the important fact that monsieur mrs_inglethorp wears very peculiar clothes has a black beard and uses glasses
hercule_poirot i cannot believe you are serious i am absolutely serious my friend but this is childish no it is very momentous
and supposing the coroner jury returns a verdict of wilful murder against mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp what becomes of your theories then
they would not be shaken because twelve stupid man had happened to make a mistake but that will not occur
for one thing a country jury is not anxious to take responsibility upon itself and mr mrs_inglethorp stands practically in the position of local squire
also he added placidly i should not allow it you would not allow it no i looked at the extraordinary little man divided between annoyance and amusement
he was so tremendously sure of himself as though he read my thoughts he nodded gently oh yes mon ami i would do what i say
he got up and laid his hand on my shoulder his physiognomy underwent a complete change tears came into his eyes
in all this you see i think of that poor mrs_inglethorp who is dead she was not extravagantly loved no
but she was very good to us belgians i owe her a debt i endeavoured to interrupt but hercule_poirot swept on
let me tell you this mr_hastings she would never forgive me if i let mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp her husband be arrested now
when a word from me could save him chapter vi the inquest in the interval before the inquest hercule_poirot was unfailing in his activity
i rather resented his not taking me into his confidence the more so as i could not in the least guess what he was driving at
it occurred to me that he might have been making inquiries at mrs_raikes farm so finding him out when i called at leastways cottage on wednesday evening i walked over there by the fields hoping to meet him
twice he was closeted with mr_wells he also took long walks into the country but there was no sign of him and i hesitated to go right up to the farm itself
as i walked away i met an aged rustic who leered at me cunningly you from the hall baint you
he asked yes i looking for a friend of mine whom i thought might have walked this way
a little chap as waves his hand when he talks one of them belgies from the village yes i said eagerly
he has been here then oh ay he been here right enough more once too friend of yours is he
ah you gentlemen from the hall you a pretty lot and he leered more jocosely than ever why do the gentlemen from the hall come here often
i asked as carelessly as i could he winked at me knowingly one does mister naming no names mind
evelyn_howard had been right then and i experienced a sharp twinge of disgust as i thought of mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp liberality with another woman money
and a very liberal gentleman too oh thank you sir i sure i walked on sharply had that piquant gipsy face been at the bottom of the crime or was it the baser mainspring of money
he once or twice observed to me that he thought mademoiselle_dorcas must have made an error in fixing the time of the quarrel
probably a judicious mixture of both on one point hercule_poirot seemed to have a curious obsession he suggested to her repeatedly that it was and not clock when she had heard the voices
quite an hour or even more had elapsed between the time when she had heard the voices and clock when she had taken tea to her mistress
but mademoiselle_dorcas was unshaken the inquest was held on friday at the stylites arms in the village hercule_poirot and i sat together not being required to give evidence
the preliminaries were gone through the jury viewed the body and mr_john_cavendish gave evidence of identification further questioned he described his awakening in the early hours of the morning and the circumstances of his mother death
there was a breathless hush and every eye was fixed on the famous london specialist who was known to be one of the greatest authorities of the day on the subject of toxicology
shorn of its medical phraseology and technicalities it amounted to the fact that mrs_inglethorp had met her death as the result of strychnine poisoning
judging from the quantity recovered she must have taken not less than three quarters of a grain of strychnine but probably one grain or slightly over
the medical evidence was next taken in a few brief words he summed up the result of the post mortem is it possible that she could have swallowed the poison by accident
asked the coroner i should consider it very unlikely strychnine is not used for domestic purposes as some poisons are and there are restrictions placed on its sale
does anything in your examination lead you to determine how the poison was administered no you arrived at styles before dr_wilkins i believe
that is so the motor met me just outside the lodge gates and i hurried there as fast as i could
will you relate to us exactly what happened next i entered mrs_inglethorp room she was at that moment in a typical tetanic convulsion
she turned towards me and gasped out mr_alfred_inglethorp alfred could the strychnine have been administered in mrs_inglethorp after dinner coffee which was taken to her by her husband
possibly but strychnine is a fairly rapid drug in its action the symptoms appear from one to two hours after it has been swallowed
i presume mrs_inglethorp took the coffee after dinner about eight clock whereas the symptoms did not manifest themselves until the early hours of the morning which on the face of it points to the drug having been taken much later in the evening
it is retarded under certain conditions none of which however appear to have been present in this case mrs_inglethorp was in the habit of drinking a cup of cocoa in the middle of the night
could the strychnine have been administered in that no i myself took a sample of the cocoa remaining in the saucepan and had it analysed
there was no strychnine present i heard hercule_poirot chuckle softly beside me how did you know i whispered
listen i should say the doctor was continuing that i would have been considerably surprised at any other result why simply because strychnine has an unusually bitter taste
it can be detected in a solution of in and can only be disguised by some strongly flavoured substance
cocoa would be quite powerless to mask it one of the jury wanted to know if the same objection applied to coffee
then you consider it more likely that the drug was administered in the coffee but that for some unknown reason its action was delayed
no coffee has a bitter taste of its own which would probably cover the taste of strychnine yes but the cup being completely smashed there is no possibility of analyzing its contents
this concluded dr_bauerstein evidence dr_wilkins corroborated it on all points sounded as to the possibility of suicide he repudiated it utterly
the deceased he said suffered from a weak heart but otherwise enjoyed perfect health and was of a cheerful and well balanced disposition
she would be one of the last people to take her own life monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish was next called his evidence was quite unimportant being a mere repetition of that of his brother
just as he was about to step down he paused and said rather hesitatingly i should like to make a suggestion if i may
he glanced deprecatingly at the coroner who replied briskly certainly mr_john_cavendish we are here to arrive at the truth of this matter and welcome anything that may lead to further elucidation
of course i may be quite wrong but it still seems to me that my mother death might be accounted for by natural means
it is just an idea of mine explained monsieur_lawrence how do you make that out mr_john_cavendish
my mother at the time of her death and for some time before it was taking a tonic containing strychnine ah said the coroner
i believe continued monsieur_lawrence that there have been case where the cumulative effect of a drug administered for some time has ended by causing death
the jury looked up interested also is it not possible that she may have taken an overdose of her medicine by accident
this is the first we have heard of the deceased taking strychnine at the time of her death we are much obliged to you mr_john_cavendish
dr_wilkins was recalled and ridiculed the idea what mr_john_cavendish suggests is quite impossible any doctor would tell you the same
strychnine is in a certain sense a cumulative poison but it would be quite impossible for it to result in sudden death in this way
there would have to be a long period of chronic symptoms which would at once have attracted my attention the whole thing is absurd
and the second suggestion that mrs_inglethorp may have inadvertently taken an overdose three or even four doses would not have resulted in death
mrs_inglethorp always had an extra large amount of medicine made up at a time as she dealt with coot the cash chemists in tadminster
she would have had to take very nearly the whole bottle to account for the amount of strychnine found at the post mortem
then you consider that we may dismiss the tonic as not being in any way instrumental in causing her death certainly
the same juryman who had interrupted before here suggested that the chemist who made up the medicine might have committed an error
the supposition is ridiculous that of course is always possible replied the doctor but mademoiselle_dorcas who was the next witness called dispelled even that possibility
the medicine had not been newly made up on the contrary mrs_inglethorp had taken the last dose on the day of her death
having elicited from mademoiselle_dorcas how she had been awakened by the violent ringing of her mistress bell and had subsequently roused the household he passed to the subject of the quarrel on the preceding afternoon
mademoiselle_dorcas evidence on this point was substantially what hercule_poirot and i had already heard so i will not repeat it here
so the question of the tonic was finally abandoned and the coroner proceeded with his task the next witness was mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish
in answer to the coroner question she told how her alarm clock having aroused her at as usual she was dressing when she was startled by the sound of something heavy falling
she stood very upright and spoke in a low clear and perfectly composed voice that would have been the table by the bed commented the coroner
mademoiselle_dorcas came running down and woke my husband and we all went to my mother in law room but it was locked the coroner interrupted her
i opened my door continued mary_cavendish and listened in a few minutes a bell rang violently i really do not think we need trouble you further on that point
we know all that can be known of the subsequent happenings but i should be obliged if you would tell us all you overheard of the quarrel the day before
she raised her hand and adjusted the ruffle of lace at her neck turning her head a little as she did so
i there was a faint insolence in her voice and quite spontaneously the thought flashed across my mind she is gaining time
i understand continued the coroner deliberately that you were sitting reading on the bench just outside the long window of the boudoir
yes that is so is it not this was news to me and glancing sideways at hercule_poirot i fancied that it was news to him as well
there was the faintest pause the mere hesitation of a moment before she answered yes that is so and the boudoir window was open was it not
surely her face grew a little paler as she answered yes then you cannot have failed to hear the voices inside especially as they were raised in anger
in fact they would be more audible where you were than in the hall possibly will you repeat to us what you overheard of the quarrel
i really do not remember hearing anything do you mean to say you did not hear voices oh yes i heard the voices but i did not hear what they said
a faint spot of colour came into her cheek i am not in the habit of listening to private conversation
the coroner persisted and you remember nothing at all nothing mrs mr_john_cavendish not one stray word or phrase to make you realize that it was a private conversation
she paused and seemed to reflect still outwardly as calm as ever yes i remember mrs_inglethorp said something
i do not remember exactly what about causing scandal between husband and wife ah the coroner leant back satisfied that corresponds with what mademoiselle_dorcas heard
but excuse me mrs mr_john_cavendish although you realized it was a private conversation you did not move away you remained where you were
i felt certain that at that moment she would willingly have torn the little lawyer with his insinuations into pieces but she replied quietly enough no
i caught the momentary gleam of her tawny eyes as she raised them i was very comfortable where i was
i fixed my mind on my book and that is all you can tell us that is all
the examination was over though i doubted if the coroner was entirely satisfied with it i think he suspected that mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish could tell more if she chose
amy hill shop assistant was next called and deposed to having sold a will form on the afternoon of the th to william earl under gardener at styles
william earl and manning succeeded her and testified to witnessing a document manning fixed the time at about william was of the opinion that it was rather earlier
mademoiselle_cynthia murdoch came next she had however little to tell she had known nothing of the tragedy until awakened by mrs mr_john_cavendish
you did not hear the table fall no i was fast asleep the coroner smiled a good conscience makes a sound sleeper he observed
thank you miss murdoch that is all miss_howard miss howard produced the letter written to her by mrs_inglethorp on the evening of the th
hercule_poirot and i had of course already seen it it added nothing to our knowledge of the tragedy the following is a facsimile
styles court essex hand written note july th my dear evelyn_howard can we not bury the hachet i have found it hard to forgive the things you said against my dear husband
but i am an old woman and very fond of you yours affectionately emily inglethorpe it was handed to the jury who scrutinized it attentively
i fear it does not help us much said the coroner with a sigh there is no mention of any of the events of that afternoon
plain as a pikestaff to me said miss_howard shortly it shows clearly enough that my poor old friend had just found out she been made a fool of
it says nothing of the kind in the letter the coroner pointed out no because emily never could bear to put herself in the wrong
but i know her she wanted me back but she wasnt going to own that i been right she went round about
most people do dont believe in it myself mr_wells smiled faintly so i noticed did several of the jury
miss_howard was obviously quite a public character anyway all this tomfoolery is a great waste of time continued the lady glancing up and down the jury disparagingly
talk talk talk when all the time we know perfectly well the coroner interrupted her in an agony of apprehension thank you miss_howard that is all
i fancy he breathed a sigh of relief when she complied then came the sensation of the day the coroner called albert mr_mace chemist assistant
in answer to the coroner questions he explained that he was a qualified pharmacist but had only recently come to this particular shop as the assistant formerly there had just been called up for the army
it was our agitated young man of the pale face these preliminaries completed the coroner proceeded to business mr_mace have you lately sold strychnine to any unauthorized person
yes sir when was this last monday night monday not tuesday no sir monday the th will you tell us to whom you sold it
you could have heard a pin drop yes sir it was to mr mrs_inglethorp every eye turned simultaneously to where mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp was sitting impassive and wooden
i half thought he was going to rise from his chair but he remained seated although a remarkably well acted expression of astonishment rose on his face
he started slightly as the damning words fell from the young man lips you are sure of what you say asked the coroner sternly
quite sure sir are you in the habit of selling strychnine indiscriminately over the counter the wretched young man wilted visibly under the coroner frown
oh no sir of course not but seeing it was mr mrs_inglethorp of the hall i thought there was no harm in it
it was only human nature to endeavour to please the hall especially when it might result in custom being transferred from coot to the local establishment
he said it was to poison a dog inwardly i sympathized is it not customary for anyone purchasing poison to sign a book
yes sir mr mrs_inglethorp did so have you got the book here yes sir it was produced and with a few words of stern censure the coroner dismissed the wretched mr_mace
then amidst a breathless silence mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp was called did he realize i wondered how closely the halter was being drawn around his neck
the coroner went straight to the point on monday evening last did you purchase strychnine for the purpose of poisoning a dog
mrs_inglethorp replied with perfect calmness no i did not there is no dog at styles except an outdoor sheepdog which is in perfect health
you deny absolutely having purchased strychnine from albert mr_mace on monday last i do do you also deny this
the coroner handed him the register in which his signature was inscribed certainly i do the hand writing is quite different from mine
i will show you he took an old envelope out of his pocket and wrote his name on it handing it to the jury
it was certainly utterly dissimilar then what is your explanation of mr_mace statement mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp replied imperturbably mr_mace must have been mistaken
the coroner hesitated for a moment and then said mr mrs_inglethorp as a mere matter of form would you mind telling us where you were on the evening of monday july th
really i cant remember that is absurd mr mrs_inglethorp said the coroner sharply think again mrs_inglethorp shook his head
i cannot tell you i have an idea that i was out walking in what direction i really cant remember
the coroner face grew graver were you in company with anyone no did you meet anyone on your walk no
i am to take it then that you decline to say where you were at the time that mr_mace positively recognized you as entering the shop to purchase strychnine
that is a pity said the coroner dryly if you like to take it that way yes be careful mr mrs_inglethorp
hercule_poirot was fidgeting nervously sacre he murmured does this imbecile of a man want to be arrested
mrs_inglethorp was indeed creating a bad impression his futile denials would not have convinced a child the coroner however passed briskly to the next point and hercule_poirot drew a deep breath of relief
you had a discussion with your wife on tuesday afternoon pardon me interrupted mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp you have been misinformed i had no quarrel with my dear wife
the whole story is absolutely untrue i was absent from the house the entire afternoon have you anyone who can testify to that
you have my word said mrs_inglethorp haughtily the coroner did not trouble to reply there are two witness who will swear to having heard your disagreement with mrs_inglethorp
those witness were mistaken i was puzzled the man spoke with such quiet assurance that i was staggered i looked at hercule_poirot
there was an expression of exultation on his face which i could not understand was he at last convinced of mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp guilt
mr mrs_inglethorp said the coroner you have heard your wife dying words repeated here can you explain them in any way
certainly i can you can it seems to me very simple the room was dimly lighted dr_bauerstein is much of my height and build and like me wears a beard
in the dim light and suffering as she was my poor wife mistook him for me ah murmured hercule_poirot to himself
but it is an idea that you think it is true i whispered i do not say that
but it is truly an ingenious supposition you read my wife last words as an accusation mrs_inglethorp was continuing they were on the contrary an appeal to me
the coroner reflected a moment then he said i believe mr mrs_inglethorp that you yourself poured out the coffee and took it to your wife that evening
i poured it out yes but i did not take it to her i meant to do so but i was told that a friend was at the hall door so
i laid down the coffee on the hall table when i came through the hall again a few minutes later it was gone
this statement might or might not be true but it did not seem to me to improve matters much for mrs_inglethorp
in any case he had had ample time to introduce the poison at that point hercule_poirot nudged me gently indicating two man who were sitting together near the door
one was a little sharp dark ferret faced man the other was tall and fair i questioned hercule_poirot mutely he put his lips to my ear
do you know who that little man is i shook my head that is detective inspector james japp of scotland yard jimmy japp
the other man is from scotland yard too things are moving quickly my friend i stared at the two man intently
i was still staring when i was startled and recalled by the verdict being given wilful murder against some person or persons unknown
there was certainly nothing of the policeman about them i should never have suspected them of being official personages chapter vii
hercule_poirot pays his debts as we came out of the stylites arms hercule_poirot drew me aside by a gentle pressure of the arm
i understood his object he was waiting for the scotland yard man in a few moments they emerged and hercule_poirot at once stepped forward and accosted the shorter of the two
i fear you do not remember me inspector japp why if it isnt mr hercule_poirot cried the inspector he turned to the other man
you ve heard me speak of mr hercule_poirot it was in he and i worked together the abercrombie forgery case you remember he was run down in brussels
ah those were great day moosier then do you remember baron altara there was a pretty rogue for you he eluded the clutches of half the police in europe
as these friendly reminiscences were being indulged in i drew nearer and was introduced to detective inspector japp who in his turn introduced us both to his companion superintendent summerhaye
but we nailed him in antwerp thanks to mr hercule_poirot here i need hardly ask what you are doing here gentlemen remarked hercule_poirot
japp closed one eye knowingly no indeed pretty clear case i should say but hercule_poirot answered gravely there i differ from you
oh come said summerhaye opening his lips for the first time surely the whole thing is clear as daylight the man caught red handed
how he could be such a fool beats me but japp was looking attentively at hercule_poirot hold your fire summerhaye he remarked jocularly
me and moosier here have met before and there no man judgment i sooner take than his if i not greatly mistaken he got something up his sleeve
isnt that so moosier hercule_poirot smiled i have drawn certain conclusions yes summerhaye was still looking rather sceptical but japp continued his scrutiny of hercule_poirot
that where the yard at a disadvantage in a case of this kind where the murder only out so to speak after the inquest
it this way he said so far we ve only seen the case from the outside a lot depends on being on the spot first thing and that where mr hercule_poirot had the start of us
we shouldnt have been here as soon as this even if it hadnt been for the fact that there was a smart doctor on the spot who gave us the tip through the coroner
from the evidence at the inquest mr mrs_inglethorp murdered his wife as sure as i stand here and if anyone but you hinted the contrary i laugh in his face
but you ve been on the spot from the first and you may have picked up some little hints i must say i was surprised the jury didnt bring it in wilful murder against him right off
i think they would have if it hadnt been for the coroner he seemed to be holding them back perhaps though you have a warrant for his arrest in your pocket now suggested hercule_poirot
a kind of wooden shutter of officialdom came down from japp expressive countenance perhaps i have and perhaps i havent he remarked dryly
hercule_poirot looked at him thoughtfully i am very anxious messieurs that he should not be arrested i dare say observed summerhaye sarcastically
japp was regarding hercule_poirot with comical perplexity cant you go a little further mr hercule_poirot a wink as good as a nod from you
you ve been on the spot and the yard doesnt want to make any mistakes you know hercule_poirot nodded gravely that is exactly what i thought
well i will tell you this use your warrant arrest mr mrs_inglethorp but it will bring you no kudos the case against him will be dismissed at once
comme ça and he snapped his fingers expressively japp face grew grave though summerhaye gave an incredulous snort as for me i was literally dumb with astonishment
i could only conclude that hercule_poirot was mad japp had taken out a handkerchief and was gently dabbing his brow
i darent do it mr hercule_poirot i take your word but there others over me who ll be asking what the devil i mean by it
cant you give me a little more to go on hercule_poirot reflected a moment it can be done he said at last
i would have preferred to work in the dark just for the present but what you say is very just the word of a belgian policeman whose day is past is not enough
i admit i do not wish it it forces my hand and mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp must not be arrested that i have sworn as my friend mr_hastings here knows
see then my good japp you go at once to styles well in about half an hour we re seeing the coroner and the doctor first
at styles mr mrs_inglethorp will give you or if he refuses as is probable i will give you such proofs that shall satisfy you that the case against him could not possibly be sustained
good call for me in passing the last house in the village i will go with you is that a bargain
and on behalf of the yard i much obliged to you though i bound to confess i cant at present see the faintest possible loop hole in the evidence but you always were a marvel
that a bargain said japp heartily so long then moosier the two detectives strode away summerhaye with an incredulous grin on his face
i had some warm moments in that court i did not figure to myself that the man would be so pig headed as to refuse to say anything at all
well my friend cried hercule_poirot before i could get in a word what do you think mon dieu decidedly it was the policy of an imbecile
m there are other explanations besides that of imbecility i remarked for if the case against him is true how could he defend himself except by silence
why in a thousand ingenious way cried hercule_poirot see say that it is i who have committed this murder i can think of seven most plausible stories
far more convincing than mr mrs_inglethorp stony denials i could not help laughing my dear hercule_poirot i am sure you are capable of thinking of seventy
but seriously in spite of what i heard you say to the detectives you surely cannot still believe in the possibility of mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp innocence
why not now as much as before nothing has changed but the evidence is so conclusive yes too conclusive
we turned in at the gate of leastways cottage and proceeded up the now familiar stairs yes yes too conclusive continued hercule_poirot almost to himself
real evidence is usually vague and unsatisfactory it has to be examined sifted but here the whole thing is cut and dried
no my friend this evidence has been very cleverly manufactured so cleverly that it has defeated its own ends how do you make that out
because so long as the evidence against him was vague and intangible it was very hard to disprove but in his anxiety the criminal has drawn the net so closely that one cut will set mrs_inglethorp free
i was silent and in a minute or two hercule_poirot continued let us look at the matter like this here is a man let us say who sets out to poison his wife
he has lived by his wits as the saying goes presumably therefore he has some wits he is not altogether a fool
he goes boldly to the village chemist and purchases strychnine under his own name with a trumped up story about a dog which is bound to be proved absurd
no he waits until he has had a violent quarrel with her of which the whole household is cognisant and which naturally directs their suspicions upon him
he prepares no defence no shadow of an alibi yet he knows the chemist assistant must necessarily come forward with the facts
well how does he set about it he does not employ the poison that night bah do not ask me to believe that any man could be so idiotic
only a lunatic who wished to commit suicide by causing himself to be hanged would act so still i do not see
i began neither do i see i tell you mon ami it puzzles me me hercule_poirot
but if you believe him innocent how do you explain his buying the strychnine very simply he did not buy it
i beg your pardon he saw a man with a black beard like mr mrs_inglethorp and wearing glasses like mr mrs_inglethorp and dressed in mr mrs_inglethorp rather noticeable clothes
he could not recognize a man whom he had probably only seen in the distance since you remember he himself had only been in the village a fortnight and mrs_inglethorp dealt principally with coot in tadminster
but mr_mace recognized him then you think mon ami do you remember the two points i laid stress upon
leave the first one for the moment what was the second the important fact that mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp wears peculiar clothes has a black beard and uses glasses i quoted
exactly now suppose anyone wished to pass himself off as mr_john_cavendish or monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish would it be easy no i said thoughtfully
of course an actor but hercule_poirot cut me short ruthlessly and why would it not be easy i will tell you my friend
to make up successfully as one of these two in broad daylight it would need an actor of genius and a certain initial facial resemblance
because they are both clean shaven man but in the case of mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp all that is changed his clothes his beard the glasses which hide his eyes those are the salient points about his personal appearance
now what is the first instinct of the criminal to divert suspicion from himself is it not so and how can he best do that
by throwing it on someone else in this instance there was a man ready to his hand everybody was predisposed to believe in mr mrs_inglethorp guilt
it was a foregone conclusion that he would be suspected but to make it a sure thing there must be tangible proof such as the actual buying of the poison and that with a man of the peculiar appearance of mr mrs_inglethorp was not difficult
remember this young mr_mace had never actually spoken to mr mrs_inglethorp how should he doubt that the man in his clothes with his beard and his glasses was not mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp
it may be so i said fascinated by hercule_poirot eloquence but if that was the case why does he not say where he was at six clock on monday evening
ah why indeed said hercule_poirot calming down if he were arrested he probably would speak but i do not want it to come to that
if he did not murder his wife he is nevertheless a scoundrel and has something of his own to conceal quite apart from the murder
i must make him see the gravity of his position there is of course something discreditable behind his silence what can it be
i mused won over to hercule_poirot view for the moment although still retaining a faint conviction that the obvious deduction was the correct one
can you not guess asked hercule_poirot smiling no can you oh yes i had a little idea sometime ago and it has turned out to be correct
you never told me i said reproachfully hercule_poirot spread out his hand apologetically pardon me mon ami you were not precisely sympathique
perhaps i said doubtfully for i was really quite indifferent to the fate of mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp and thought that a good fright would do him no harm
he turned to me earnestly tell me you see now that he must not be arrested hercule_poirot who was watching me intently gave a sigh
come my friend he said changing the subject apart from mr mrs_inglethorp how did the evidence at the inquest strike you
oh pretty much what i expected did nothing strike you as peculiar about it my thoughts flew to mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish and i hedged in what way
well mr monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish evidence for instance i was relieved oh monsieur_lawrence no i dont think so he always a nervous chap
his suggestion that his mother might have been poisoned accidentally by means of the tonic she was taking that did not strike you as strange hein
no i cant say it did the doctors ridiculed it of course but it was quite a natural suggestion for a layman to make
but monsieur_lawrence is not a layman you told me yourself that he had started by studying medicine and that he had taken his degree
yes that true i never thought of that i was rather startled it is odd hercule_poirot nodded from the first his behaviour has been peculiar
of all the household he alone would be likely to recognize the symptoms of strychnine poisoning and yet we find him the only member of the family to uphold strenuously the theory of death from natural causes
if it had been monsieur mr_john_cavendish i could have understood it he has no technical knowledge and is by nature unimaginative
but monsieur_lawrence no and now to day he puts forward a suggestion that he himself must have known was ridiculous there is food for thought in this mon ami
it very confusing i agreed then there is mrs mr_john_cavendish continued hercule_poirot that another who is not telling all she knows
what do you make of her attitude i dont know what to make of it it seems inconceivable that she should be shielding mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp
yet that is what it looks like hercule_poirot nodded reflectively yes it is queer one thing is certain she overheard a good deal more of that private conversation than she was willing to admit
and yet she is the last person one would accuse of stooping to eavesdrop exactly one thing her evidence has shown me
i made a mistake mademoiselle_dorcas was quite right the quarrel did take place earlier in the afternoon about four clock as she said
i looked at him curiously i had never understood his insistence on that point yes a good deal that was peculiar came out to day continued hercule_poirot
dr_bauerstein now what was he doing up and dressed at that hour in the morning it is astonishing to me that no one commented on the fact
he has insomnia i believe i said doubtfully which is a very good or a very bad explanation remarked hercule_poirot
it covers everything and explains nothing i shall keep my eye on our clever dr_bauerstein any more faults to find with the evidence
i inquired satirically mon ami replied hercule_poirot gravely when you find that people are not telling you the truth look out
now unless i am much mistaken at the inquest to day only one at most two persons were speaking the truth without reservation or subterfuge
oh come now hercule_poirot i wont cite monsieur_lawrence or mrs mr_john_cavendish but there mr_john_cavendish and miss_howard surely they were speaking the truth
miss_howard evidence unimportant as it was had been given in such a downright straightforward manner that it had never occurred to me to doubt her sincerity
still i had a great respect for hercule_poirot sagacity except on the occasions when he was what i described to myself as foolishly pig headed
both of them my friend one i grant you but both his words gave me an unpleasant shock
do you really think so i asked miss_howard had always seemed to me so essentially honest almost uncomfortably so
hercule_poirot gave me a curious look which i could not quite fathom he seemed to speak and then checked himself
but it was strange that she never heard a sound sleeping next door whereas mrs mr_john_cavendish in the other wing of the building distinctly heard the table fall
miss murdoch too i continued there nothing untruthful about her no well she young and she sleeps soundly
i did not quite like the tone of his voice but at that moment a smart knock reached our ears and looking out of the window we perceived the two detectives waiting for us below
hercule_poirot seized his hat gave a ferocious twist to his moustache and carefully brushing an imaginary speck of dust from his sleeve motioned me to precede him down the stairs there we joined the detectives and set out for styles
i think the appearance of the two scotland yard man was rather a shock especially to mr_john_cavendish though of course after the verdict he had realized that it was only a matter of time
ah yes indeed she must be a famous sleeper that one still the presence of the detectives brought the truth home to him more than anything else could have done
hercule_poirot had conferred with japp in a low tone on the way up and it was the latter functionary who requested that the household with the exception of the servants should be assembled together in the drawing room
i realized the significance of this it was up to hercule_poirot to make his boast good personally i was not sanguine
hercule_poirot might have excellent reasons for his belief in mrs_inglethorp innocence but a man of the type of summerhaye would require tangible proofs and these i doubted if hercule_poirot could supply
before very long we had all trooped into the drawing room the door of which japp closed hercule_poirot politely set chairs for every one
i think that for the first time we realized that the thing was not a bad dream but a tangible reality
the scotland yard man were the cynosure of all eyes we had read of such things now we ourselves were actors in the drama
to morrow the daily paper all over england would blazon out the news in staring headlines mysterious tragedy in essex wealthy lady poisoned
there would be pictures of styles snap shots of the family leaving the inquest the village photographer had not been idle all the things that one had read a hundred time things that happen to other people not to oneself
and now in this house a murder had been committed in front of us were the detectives in charge of the case
i think every one was a little surprised that it should be he and not one of the official detectives who took the initiative
mesdames and messieurs said hercule_poirot bowing as though he were a celebrity about to deliver a lecture i have asked you to come here all together for a certain object
the well known glib phraseology passed rapidly through my mind in the interval before hercule_poirot opened the proceedings that object it concerns mr mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp
mrs_inglethorp was sitting a little by himself i think unconsciously every one had drawn his chair slightly away from him and he gave a faint start as hercule_poirot pronounced his name
mr mrs_inglethorp said hercule_poirot addressing him directly a very dark shadow is resting on this house the shadow of murder
mrs_inglethorp shook his head sadly my poor wife he murmured poor emily it is terrible i do not think monsieur said hercule_poirot pointedly that you quite realize how terrible it may be for you
and as mrs_inglethorp did not appear to understand he added mr mrs_inglethorp you are standing in very grave danger
the two detectives fidgeted i saw the official caution anything you say will be used in evidence against you actually hovering on summerhaye lips
hercule_poirot went on do you understand now monsieur no what do you mean i mean said hercule_poirot deliberately that you are suspected of poisoning your wife
a little gasp ran round the circle at this plain speaking good heavens cried mrs_inglethorp starting up what a monstrous idea
i poison my dearest emily i do not think hercule_poirot watched him narrowly that you quite realize the unfavourable nature of your evidence at the inquest
mr mrs_inglethorp knowing what i have now told you do you still refuse to say where you were at six clock on monday afternoon
with a groan mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp sank down again and buried his face in his hand hercule_poirot approached and stood over him
speak he cried menacingly with an effort mrs_inglethorp raised his face from his hand then slowly and deliberately he shook his head
you will not speak no i do not believe that anyone could be so monstrous as to accuse me of what you say
hercule_poirot nodded thoughtfully like a man whose mind is made up soit he said then i must speak for you
mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp sprang up again you how can you speak you do not know he broke off abruptly hercule_poirot turned to face us
i hercule_poirot affirm that the man who entered the chemist shop and purchased strychnine at six clock on monday last was not mr mrs_inglethorp for at six clock on that day mr mrs_inglethorp was escorting mrs_raikes back to her home from a neighbouring farm
i can produce no less than five witness to swear to having seen them together either at six or just after and as you may know the abbey farm mrs_raikes home is at least two and a half miles distant from the village
mesdames and messieurs i speak listen there is absolutely no question as to the alibi chapter viii fresh suspicions
there was a moment stupefied silence japp who was the least surprised of any of us was the first to speak
my word he cried you re the goods and no mistake mr hercule_poirot these witness of yours are all right i suppose
voilà i have prepared a list of them names and addresses you must see them of course but you will find it all right
i sure of that japp lowered his voice i much obliged to you a pretty mare nest arresting him would have been
he turned to mrs_inglethorp but if you ll excuse me sir why couldnt you say all this at the inquest
i will tell you why interrupted hercule_poirot there was a certain rumour a most malicious and utterly untrue one interrupted mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp in an agitated voice
and mr mrs_inglethorp was anxious to have no scandal revived just at present am i right quite right
with my poor emily not yet buried can you wonder i was anxious that no more lying rumours should be started
mrs_inglethorp nodded between you and me sir remarked japp i sooner have any amount of rumours than be arrested for murder
and i venture to think your poor lady would have felt the same and if it hadnt been for mr hercule_poirot here arrested you would have been as sure as eggs is eggs
i was foolish no doubt murmured mrs_inglethorp but you do not know inspector how i have been persecuted and maligned
now sir said japp turning briskly to mr_john_cavendish i should like to see the lady bedroom please and after that i ll have a little chat with the servants
and he shot a baleful glance at evelyn_howard dont you bother about anything mr hercule_poirot here will show me the way
as they all went out of the room hercule_poirot turned and made me a sign to follow him upstairs there he caught me by the arm and drew me aside
quick go to the other wing stand there just this side of the baize door do not move till i come
i followed his instructions taking up my position by the baize door and wondering what on earth lay behind the request
then turning rapidly he rejoined the two detectives why was i to stand in this particular spot on guard i looked thoughtfully down the corridor in front of me
an idea struck me with the exception of mademoiselle_cynthia murdoch every one room was in this left wing had that anything to do with it
was i to report who came or went i stood faithfully at my post the minutes passed nobody came nothing happened
it must have been quite twenty minutes before hercule_poirot rejoined me you have not stirred no i ve stuck here like a rock
nothing happened ah was he pleased or disappointed you ve seen nothing at all no but you have probably heard something
a big bump eh mon ami no is it possible ah but i am vexed with myself i am not usually clumsy
i made but a slight gesture i know hercule_poirot gestures with the left hand and over went the table by the bed he looked so childishly vexed and crest fallen that i hastened to console him
never mind old chap what does it matter your triumph downstairs excited you i can tell you that was a surprise to us all
there must be more in this affair of mrs_inglethorp with mrs_raikes than we thought to make him hold his tongue so persistently
what are you going to do now where are the scotland yard fellows gone down to interview the servants i showed them all our exhibits
i am disappointed in japp he has no method hullo i said looking out of the window here dr_bauerstein
i believe you re right about that man hercule_poirot i dont like him he is clever observed hercule_poirot meditatively oh clever as the devil
i must say i was overjoyed to see him in the plight he was in on tuesday you never saw such a spectacle
and i described the doctor adventure he looked a regular scarecrow plastered with mud from head to foot you saw him then
yes of course he didnt want to come in it was just after dinner but mr mrs_inglethorp insisted what hercule_poirot caught me violently by the shoulders
was dr_bauerstein here on tuesday evening here and you never told me why did you not tell me why
why he appeared to be in an absolute frenzy my dear hercule_poirot i expostulated i never thought it would interest you
i didnt know it was of any importance importance it is of the first importance so dr_bauerstein was here on tuesday night the night of the murder
mr_hastings do you not see that alters everything everything i had never seen him so upset loosening his hold of me he mechanically straightened a pair of candlesticks still murmuring to himself
yes that alters everything everything suddenly he seemed to come to a decision allons he said we must act at once
where is mr_john_cavendish mr_john_cavendish was in the smoking room hercule_poirot went straight to him mr_john_cavendish i have some important business in tadminster
a new clue may i take your motor why of course do you mean at once if you please
mr_john_cavendish rang the bell and ordered round the car in another ten minutes we were racing down the park and along the high road to tadminster
now hercule_poirot i remarked resignedly perhaps you will tell me what all this is about well mon ami a good deal you can guess for yourself
of course you realize that now mr mrs_inglethorp is out of it the whole position is greatly changed we are face to face with an entirely new problem
we know now that there is one person who did not buy the poison we have cleared away the manufactured clues
i have ascertained that anyone in the household with the exception of mrs mr_john_cavendish who was playing tennis with you could have personated mr mrs_inglethorp on monday evening
now for the real ones in the same way we have his statement that he put the coffee down in the hall
we must find out who did take that coffee to mrs_inglethorp eventually or who passed through the hall whilst it was standing there
no one took much notice of that at the inquest but now it has a very different significance from your account there are only two people whom we can positively say did not go near the coffee mrs
mr_john_cavendish and mademoiselle_cynthia yes that is so i felt an inexpressible lightening of the heart mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish could certainly not rest under suspicion
in clearing mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp continued hercule_poirot i have been obliged to show my hand sooner than i intended as long as i might be thought to be pursuing him the criminal would be off his guard
now he will be doubly careful yes doubly careful he turned to me abruptly tell me mr_hastings you yourself have you no suspicions of anybody
to tell the truth an idea wild and extravagant in itself had once or twice that morning flashed through my brain
i hesitated i had rejected it as absurd nevertheless it persisted you couldnt call it a suspicion i murmured
it so utterly foolish come now urged hercule_poirot encouragingly do not fear speak your mind you should always pay attention to your instincts
well then i blurted out it absurd but i suspect miss_howard of not telling all she knows miss_howard
i cant help feeling i continued blunderingly that we ve rather left her out of the possible suspects simply on the strength of her having been away from the place
yes you ll laugh at me not at all why should i but after all she was only fifteen miles away a car would do it in half an hour
can we say positively that she was away from styles on the night of the murder yes my friend said hercule_poirot unexpectedly we can
well i learnt that miss_howard had been on afternoon duty on tuesday and that a convoy coming in unexpectedly she had kindly offered to remain on night duty which offer was gratefully accepted
one of my first actions was to ring up the hospital where she was working well that disposes of that
oh i said rather nonplussed really i continued it her extraordinary vehemence against mrs_inglethorp that started me off suspecting her
i cant help feeling she do anything against him and i had an idea she might know something about the destroying of the will
she might have burnt the new one mistaking it for the earlier one in his favour she is so terribly bitter against him
you consider her vehemence unnatural es she is so very violent i wondered really whether she is quite sane on that point
hercule_poirot shook his head energetically no no you are on a wrong tack there there is nothing weak minded or degenerate about miss_howard
she is an excellent specimen of well balanced english beef and brawn she is sanity itself yet her hatred of mrs_inglethorp seems almost a mania
my idea was a very ridiculous one no doubt that she had intended to poison him and that in some way mrs_inglethorp got hold of it by mistake
but i dont at all see how it could have been done the whole thing is absurd and ridiculous to the last degree
it is always wise to suspect everybody until you can prove logically and to your own satisfaction that they are innocent
still you are right in one thing now what reasons are there against miss_howard having deliberately poisoned mrs_inglethorp
why she was devoted to her i exclaimed tcha tcha cried hercule_poirot irritably you argue like a child
if miss_howard were capable of poisoning the old lady she would be quite equally capable of simulating devotion no we must look elsewhere
you are perfectly correct in your assumption that her vehemence against mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp is too violent to be natural but you are quite wrong in the deduction you draw from it
i have drawn my own deductions which i believe to be correct but i will not speak of them at present
he paused a minute then went on now to my way of thinking there is one insuperable objection to miss_howard being the murderess
and that is that in no possible way could mrs_inglethorp death benefit miss_howard now there is no murder without a motive
i reflected could not mrs_inglethorp have made a will in her favour hercule_poirot shook his head but you yourself suggested that possibility to mr_wells
hercule_poirot smiled that was for a reason i did not want to mention the name of the person who was actually in my mind
miss_howard occupied very much the same position so i used her name instead still mrs_inglethorp might have done so
why that will made on the afternoon of her death may but hercule_poirot shake of the head was so energetic that i stopped
no my friend i have certain little ideas of my own about that will but i can tell you this much it was not in miss_howard favour
i accepted his assurance though i did not really see how he could be so positive about the matter
well i said with a sigh we will acquit miss_howard then it is partly your fault that i ever came to suspect her
it was what you said about her evidence at the inquest that set me off hercule_poirot looked puzzled what did i say about her evidence at the inquest
dont you remember when i cited her and mr_john_cavendish as being above suspicion oh ah yes he seemed a little confused but recovered himself
by the way mr_hastings there is something i want you to do for me certainly what is it next time you happen to be alone with monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish i want you to say this to him
i have a message for you from hercule_poirot he says find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace nothing more
nothing less find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace is that right i asked much mystified excellent
but what does it mean ah that i will leave you to find out you have access to the facts
just say that to him and see what he says very well but it all extremely mysterious we were running into tadminster now and hercule_poirot directed the car to the analytical chemist
hercule_poirot hopped down briskly and went inside in a few minutes he was back again there he said
that is all my business what were you doing there i asked in lively curiosity i left something to be analysed
yes but what the sample of cocoa i took from the saucepan in the bedroom but that has already been tested
i cried stupefied dr_bauerstein had it tested and you yourself laughed at the possibility of there being strychnine in it
i know dr_bauerstein had it tested replied hercule_poirot quietly well then well i have a fancy for having it analysed again that is all
and not another word on the subject could i drag out of him this proceeding of hercule_poirot in respect of the cocoa puzzled me intensely
however my confidence in him which at one time had rather waned was fully restored since his belief in mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp innocence had been so triumphantly vindicated
the funeral of mrs_inglethorp took place the following day and on monday as i came down to a late breakfast mr_john_cavendish drew me aside and informed me that mr mrs_inglethorp was leaving that morning to take up his quarters at the stylites arms until he should have completed his plans
i could see neither rhyme nor reason in it and really it a great relief to think he going mr_hastings continued my honest friend
it was bad enough before when we thought he done it but i hanged if it isnt worse now when we all feel guilty for having been so down on the fellow
the fact is we ve treated him abominably of course things did look black against him i dont see how anyone could blame us for jumping to the conclusions we did
still there it is we were in the wrong and now there a beastly feeling that one ought to make amends which is difficult when one doesnt like the fellow a bit better than one did before
the whole thing damned awkward and i thankful he had the tact to take himself off it a good thing styles wasnt the mater to leave to him
couldnt bear to think of the fellow lording it here he welcome to her money you ll be able to keep up the place all right
there are the death duties of course but half my father money goes with the place and monsieur_lawrence will stay with us for the present so there is his share as well
we shall be pinched at first of course because as i once told you i am in a bit of a hole financially myself
i asked oh yes still the johnnies will wait now in the general relief at mrs_inglethorp approaching departure we had the most genial breakfast we had experienced since the tragedy
mademoiselle_cynthia whose young spirits were naturally buoyant was looking quite her pretty self again and we all with the exception of monsieur_lawrence who seemed unalterably gloomy and nervous were quietly cheerful at the opening of a new and hopeful future
glaring headlines sandwiched biographies of every member of the household subtle innuendoes the usual familiar tag about the police having a clue
the war was momentarily inactive and the newspapers seized with avidity on this crime in fashionable life the mysterious affair at styles was the topic of the moment
the paper of course had been full of the tragedy nothing was spared us it was a slack time naturally it was very annoying for the cavendishes
the house was constantly besieged by reporters who were consistently denied admission but who continued to haunt the village and the grounds where they lay in wait with cameras for any unwary members of the household
we all lived in a blast of publicity the scotland yard man came and went examining questioning lynx eyed and reserved of tongue
towards what end they were working we did not know had they any clue or would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes
after breakfast mademoiselle_dorcas came up to me rather mysteriously and asked if she might have a few words with me
certainly what is it mademoiselle_dorcas well it just this sir you ll be seeing the belgian gentleman to day perhaps i nodded
well sir you know how he asked me so particular if the mistress or anyone else had a green dress
but since then i ve remembered what the young gentlemen mr_john_cavendish and monsieur_lawrence were still the young gentlemen to mademoiselle_dorcas call the dressing up box
yes yes you have found one my interest was aroused no not that sir it up in the front attic sir
a great chest full of old clothes and fancy dresses and what not and it came to me sudden like that there might be a green dress amongst them
so if you tell the belgian gentleman i will tell him mademoiselle_dorcas i promised thank you very much sir a very nice gentleman he is sir
i dont hold with foreigners as a rule but from what the newspapers say i make out as how these brave belges isnt the ordinary run of foreigners and certainly he a most polite spoken gentleman
and quite a different class from them two detectives from london what goes prying about and asking questions dear old mademoiselle_dorcas
as she stood there with her honest face upturned to mine i thought what a fine specimen she was of the old fashioned servant that is so fast dying out
i thought i might as well go down to the village at once and look up hercule_poirot but i met him half way coming up to the house and at once gave him mademoiselle_dorcas message
ah the brave mademoiselle_dorcas we will look at the chest although but no matter we will examine it all the same
we entered the house by one of the windows there was no one in the hall and we went straight up to the attic
sure enough there was the chest a fine old piece all studded with brass nails and full to overflowing with every imaginable type of garment
hercule_poirot bundled everything out on the floor with scant ceremony there were one or two green fabrics of varying shades but hercule_poirot shook his head over them all
he seemed somewhat apathetic in the search as though he expected no great results from it suddenly he gave an exclamation
what is it look the chest was nearly empty and there reposing right at the bottom was a magnificent black beard
ohó said hercule_poirot ohó he turned it over in his hand examining it closely new he remarked
after a moment hesitation he replaced it in the chest heaped all the other things on top of it as before and made his way briskly downstairs
yes quite new he went straight to the pantry where we found mademoiselle_dorcas busily polishing her silver hercule_poirot wished her good morning with gallic politeness and went on we have been looking through that chest mademoiselle_dorcas
i am much obliged to you for mentioning it there is indeed a fine collection there are they often used may i ask
well sir not very often nowadays though from time to time we do have what the young gentlemen call a dress up night
i shall never forget the night he came down as the char of persia i think he called it a sort of eastern king it was
and very funny it is sometimes sir mr monsieur_lawrence he wonderful most comic he had the big paper knife in his hand and mind mademoiselle_dorcas he says you ll have to be very respectful
miss mademoiselle_cynthia she was what they call an apache or some such name a frenchified sort of cut throat i take it to be
this is my specially sharpened scimitar and it off with your head if i at all displeased with you a real sight she looked
you never have believed a pretty young lady like that could have made herself into such a ruffian nobody would have known her
these evenings must have been great fun said hercule_poirot genially i suppose mr monsieur_lawrence wore that fine black beard in the chest upstairs when he was shah of persia
he did have a beard sir replied mademoiselle_dorcas smiling and well i know it for he borrowed two skeins of my black wool to make it with
and i sure it looked wonderfully natural at a distance i didnt know as there was a beard up there at all
it must have been got quite lately i think there was a red wig i know but nothing else in the way of hair
burnt corks they use mostly though tis messy getting it off again miss mademoiselle_cynthia was a nigger once and oh the trouble she had
so mademoiselle_dorcas knows nothing about that black beard said hercule_poirot thoughtfully as we walked out into the hall again
do you think it is the one i whispered eagerly hercule_poirot nodded i do you notice it had been trimmed
no yes it was cut exactly the shape of mr mrs_inglethorp and i found one or two snipped hairs mr_hastings this affair is very deep
you realize that he chose the one place in the house to hide it where its presence would not be remarked
who put it in the chest i wonder someone with a good deal of intelligence remarked hercule_poirot dryly yes he is intelligent
but we must be more intelligent we must be so intelligent that he does not suspect us of being intelligent at all
i acquiesced there mon ami you will be of great assistance to me i was pleased with the compliment
there had been time when i hardly thought that hercule_poirot appreciated me at my true worth yes he continued staring at me thoughtfully you will be invaluable
this was naturally gratifying but hercule_poirot next words were not so welcome i must have an ally in the house he observed reflectively
you have me i protested true but you are not sufficient i was hurt and showed it hercule_poirot hurried to explain himself
you do not quite take my meaning you are known to be working with me i want somebody who is not associated with us in any way
oh i see how about mr_john_cavendish no i think not the dear fellow isnt perhaps very bright i said thoughtfully
here comes miss_howard said hercule_poirot suddenly she is the very person but i am in her black books since i cleared mr mrs_inglethorp
still we can but try with a nod that was barely civil miss_howard assented to hercule_poirot request for a few minutes conversation
we went into the little morning room and hercule_poirot closed the door well monsieur hercule_poirot said miss_howard impatiently what is it
out with it i busy do you remember mademoiselle_cynthia that i once asked you to help me yes i do
the lady nodded and i told you i help you with pleasure to hang mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp ah hercule_poirot studied her seriously
miss_howard i will ask you one question i beg of you to reply to it truthfully never tell lies replied miss_howard
it is this do you still believe that mrs_inglethorp was poisoned by her husband what do you mean
she asked sharply you neednt think your pretty explanations influence me in the slightest i ll admit that it wasnt he who bought strychnine at the chemist shop
what of that i dare say he soaked fly paper as i told you at the beginning that is arsenic not strychnine said hercule_poirot mildly
what does that matter arsenic would put poor emily out of the way just as well as strychnine if i convinced he did it it doesnt matter a jot to me how he did it
exactly if you are convinced he did it said hercule_poirot quietly i will put my question in another form
did you ever in your heart of hearts believe that mrs_inglethorp was poisoned by her husband good heavens cried miss_howard
havent i always told you the man is a villain havent i always told you he would murder her in her bed
havent i always hated him like poison exactly said hercule_poirot that bears out my little idea entirely what little idea
miss_howard do you remember a conversation that took place on the day of my friend arrival here he repeated it to me and there is a sentence of yours that has impressed me very much
do you remember affirming that if a crime had been committed and anyone you loved had been murdered you felt certain that you would know by instinct who the criminal was even if you were quite unable to prove it
yes i remember saying that i believe it too i suppose you think it nonsense not at all and yet you will pay no attention to my instinct against mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp
no said hercule_poirot curtly because your instinct is not against mr mrs_inglethorp what no you wish to believe he committed the crime
you believe him capable of committing it but your instinct tells you he did not commit it it tells you more shall i go on
she was staring at him fascinated and made a slight affirmative movement of the hand shall i tell you why you have been so vehement against mr mrs_inglethorp
it is because you have been trying to believe what you wish to believe it is because you are trying to drown and stifle your instinct which tells you another name
no no no cried miss_howard wildly flinging up her hand dont say it oh dont say it it isnt true
it cant be true i dont know what put such a wild such a dreadful idea into my head i am right am i not asked hercule_poirot
yes yes you must be a wizard to have guessed but it cant be so it too monstrous too impossible it must be mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp
hercule_poirot shook his head gravely dont ask me about it continued miss_howard because i shant tell you i wont admit it even to myself
i must be mad to think of such a thing hercule_poirot nodded as if satisfied i will ask you nothing
it is enough for me that it is as i thought and i i too have an instinct we are working together towards a common end
dont ask me to help you because i wont i wouldnt lift a finger to to she faltered you will help me in spite of yourself
i ask you nothing but you will be my ally you will not be able to help yourself you will do the only thing that i want of you
and that is you will watch evelyn_howard bowed her head yes i cant help doing that i am always watching always hoping i shall be proved wrong
if we are wrong well and good said hercule_poirot no one will be more pleased than i shall but if we are right
if we are right miss_howard on whose side are you then i dont know i dont know come now
it could be hushed up there must be no hushing up but emily herself she broke off miss_howard said hercule_poirot gravely this is unworthy of you
suddenly she took her face from her hand yes she said quietly that was not evelyn_howard who spoke
she flung her head up proudly this is evelyn_howard and she is on the side of justice let the cost be what it may
and with these words she walked firmly out of the room there said hercule_poirot looking after her goes a very valuable ally
that woman mr_hastings has got brains as well as a heart i did not reply instinct is a marvellous thing mused hercule_poirot
it can neither be explained nor ignored you and miss_howard seem to know what you are talking about i observed coldly
perhaps you dont realize that i am still in the dark really is that so mon ami
yes enlighten me will you hercule_poirot studied me attentively for a moment or two then to my intense surprise he shook his head decidedly
no my friend oh look here why not two is enough for a secret well i think it is very unfair to keep back facts from me
i am not keeping back facts every fact that i know is in your possession you can draw your own deductions from them
this time it is a question of ideas still it would be interesting to know hercule_poirot looked at me very earnestly and again shook his head
you see he said sadly you have no instincts it was intelligence you were requiring just now i pointed out
the two often go together said hercule_poirot enigmatically the remark seemed so utterly irrelevant that i did not even take the trouble to answer it
but i decided that if i made any interesting and important discoveries as no doubt i should i would keep them to myself and surprise hercule_poirot with the ultimate result
there are time when it is one duty to assert oneself chapter ix dr_bauerstein i had had no opportunity as yet of passing on hercule_poirot message to monsieur_lawrence
but now as i strolled out on the lawn still nursing a grudge against my friend high handedness i saw monsieur_lawrence on the croquet lawn aimlessly knocking a couple of very ancient balls about with a still more ancient mallet
it struck me that it would be a good opportunity to deliver my message otherwise hercule_poirot himself might relieve me of it
it was true that i did not quite gather its purport but i flattered myself that by monsieur_lawrence reply and perhaps a little skillful cross examination on my part i should soon perceive its significance
accordingly i accosted him i ve been looking for you i remarked untruthfully have you yes the truth is i ve got a message for you from hercule_poirot
he told me to wait until i was alone with you i said dropping my voice significantly and watching him intently out of the corner of my eye
yes i have always been rather good at what is called i believe creating an atmosphere well there was no change of expression in the dark melancholic face
had he any idea of what i was about to say this is the message i dropped my voice still lower
find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace what on earth does he mean monsieur_lawrence stared at me in quite unaffected astonishment
dont you know not in the least do you i was compelled to shake my head what extra coffee cup
i dont know he better ask mademoiselle_dorcas or one of the maids if he wants to know about coffee cups
i dont know anything about the coffee cups except that we ve got some that are never used which are a perfect dream
it their business not mine old worcester you re not a connoisseur are you mr_hastings i shook my head you miss a lot
a really perfect bit of old china it pure delight to handle it or even to look at it well what am i to tell hercule_poirot
tell him i dont know what he talking about it double dutch to me all right i was moving off towards the house again when he suddenly called me back
i say what was the end of that message say it over again will you find the extra coffee cup and you can rest in peace
are you sure you dont know what it means i asked him earnestly he shook his head no he said musingly i dont
i i wish i did the boom of the gong sounded from the house and we went in together hercule_poirot had been asked by mr_john_cavendish to remain to lunch and was already seated at the table
but after the cheese and biscuits had been handed round and mademoiselle_dorcas had left the room hercule_poirot suddenly leant forward to mrs mr_john_cavendish
pardon me madame for recalling unpleasant memories but i have a little idea hercule_poirot little ideas were becoming a perfect byword and would like to ask one or two questions
by tacit consent all mention of the tragedy was barred we conversed on the war and other outside topics of me
what i want to ask is this the door leading into mrs_inglethorp room from that of mademoiselle_cynthia it was bolted you say
certainly you are too amiable madame certainly it was bolted replied mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish rather surprised i said so at the inquest
bolted yes she looked perplexed i mean explained hercule_poirot you are sure it was bolted and not merely locked
i said bolted meaning that it was fastened and i could not open it but i believe all the doors were found bolted on the inside
oh i see what you mean no i dont know still as far as you are concerned the door might equally well have been locked
you yourself did not happen to notice madame when you entered mrs_inglethorp room whether that door was bolted or not
oh yes i i believe it was but you did not see it no i never looked
but i did interrupted monsieur_lawrence suddenly i happened to notice that it was bolted ah that settles it and hercule_poirot looked crestfallen
i could not help rejoicing that for once one of his little ideas had come to naught after lunch hercule_poirot begged me to accompany him home
i consented rather stiffly you are annoyed is it not so he asked anxiously as we walked through the park
not at all i said coldly that is well that lifts a great load from my mind this was not quite what i had intended
i had hoped that he would have observed the stiffness of my manner still the fervour of his words went towards the appeasing of my just displeasure
i thawed i gave monsieur_lawrence your message i said and what did he say he was entirely puzzled
i had expected hercule_poirot to be disappointed but to my surprise he replied that that was as he had thought and that he was very glad
yes i am quite sure he had no idea of what you meant my pride forbade me to ask any questions
hercule_poirot switched off on another tack mademoiselle_cynthia was not at lunch to day how was that she is at the hospital again
she resumed work to day ah she is an industrious little demoiselle and pretty too she is like pictures i have seen in italy
i would rather like to see that dispensary of hers do you think she would show it to me i am sure she would be delighted
it an interesting little place does she go there every day she has all wednesdays off and comes back to lunch on saturdays
those are her only time off i will remember women are doing great work nowadays and mademoiselle_cynthia is clever
oh yes she has brains that little one yes i believe she has passed quite a stiff exam without doubt
after all it is very responsible work i suppose they have very strong poisons there yes she showed them to us
they are kept locked up in a little cupboard i believe they have to be very careful they always take out the key before leaving the room
indeed it is near the window this cupboard no right the other side of the room why hercule_poirot shrugged his shoulders
i wondered that is all will you come in we had reached the cottage no i think i ll be getting back
i shall go round the long way through the woods the woods round styles were very beautiful after the walk across the open park it was pleasant to saunter lazily through the cool glades
there was hardly a breath of wind the very chirp of the birds was faint and subdued i strolled on a little way and finally flung myself down at the foot of a grand old beech tree
my thoughts of mankind were kindly and charitable i even forgave hercule_poirot for his absurd secrecy in fact i was at peace with the world
then i yawned i thought about the crime and it struck me as being very unreal and far off i yawned again
probably i thought it really never happened of course it was all a bad dream the truth of the matter was that it was monsieur_lawrence who had murdered mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp with a croquet mallet
but it was absurd of mr_john_cavendish to make such a fuss about it and to go shouting out i tell you i wont have it
for about twelve feet away from me mr_john_cavendish and mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish were standing facing each other and they were evidently quarrelling
and quite as evidently they were unaware of my vicinity for before i could move or speak mr_john_cavendish repeated the words which had aroused me from my dream
i woke up with a start at once i realized that i was in a very awkward predicament i tell you mary_cavendish i wont have it
mary_cavendish voice came cool and liquid have you any right to criticize my actions it will be the talk of the village
my mother was only buried on saturday and here you are gadding about with the fellow oh she shrugged her shoulders if it is only village gossip that you mind
but it isnt i ve had enough of the fellow hanging about he a polish jew anyway a tinge of jewish blood is not a bad thing
it leavens the she looked at him stolid stupidity of the ordinary englishman fire in her eyes ice in her voice i did not wonder that the blood rose to mr_john_cavendish face in a crimson tide
mary_cavendish well her tone did not change the pleading died out of his voice am i to understand that you will continue to see dr_bauerstein against my express wishes
if i choose you defy me no but i deny your right to criticize my actions have you no friend of whom i should disapprove
mr_john_cavendish fell back a pace the colour ebbed slowly from his face what do you mean he said in an unsteady voice
you do see dont you that you have no right to dictate to me as to the choice of my friend
you see said mary_cavendish quietly mr_john_cavendish glanced at her pleadingly a stricken look on his face no right
have i no right mary_cavendish he said unsteadily he stretched out his hand mary_cavendish for a moment i thought she wavered
a softer expression came over her face then suddenly she turned almost fiercely away none she was walking away when mr_john_cavendish sprang after her and caught her by the arm
she hesitated and suddenly there swept across her face a strange expression old as the hills yet with something eternally young about it
mary_cavendish his voice was very quiet now are you in love with this fellow dr_bauerstein so might some egyptian sphinx have smiled
perhaps she said and then swiftly passed out of the little glade leaving mr_john_cavendish standing there as though he had been turned to stone
she freed herself quietly from his arm and spoke over her shoulder rather ostentatiously i stepped forward crackling some dead branches with my feet as i did so
mr_john_cavendish turned luckily he took it for granted that i had only just come upon the scene hullo mr_hastings have you seen the little fellow safely back to his cottage
quaint little chap is he any good though really he was considered one of the finest detectives of his day
oh well i suppose there must be something in it then what a rotten world it is though you find it so
i asked good lord yes there this terrible business to start with scotland yard man in and out of the house like a jack in the box
never know where they wont turn up next screaming headlines in every paper in the country damn all journalists i say do you know there was a whole crowd staring in at the lodge gates this morning
sort of madame tussaud chamber of horrors business that can be seen for nothing pretty thick isnt it cheer up mr_john_cavendish
i said soothingly it cant last for ever cant it though it can last long enough for us never to be able to hold up our heads again
enough to make a man morbid to be stalked by beastly journalists and stared at by gaping moon faced idiots wherever he goes
no no you re getting morbid on the subject but there worse than that what mr_john_cavendish lowered his voice have you ever thought mr_hastings
it a nightmare to me who did it i cant help feeling sometimes it must have been an accident because because who could have done it
now mrs_inglethorp out of the way there no one else no one i mean except one of us yes indeed that was nightmare enough for any man
one of us yes surely it must be so unless a new idea suggested itself to my mind rapidly i considered it
the light increased hercule_poirot mysterious doings his hints they all fitted in fool that i was not to have thought of this possibility before and what a relief for us all
no mr_john_cavendish i said it isnt one of us how could it be i know but still who else is there
cant you guess no i looked cautiously round and lowered my voice dr_bauerstein i whispered impossible
not at all but what earthly interest could he have in my mother death that i dont see i confessed but i ll tell you this hercule_poirot thinks so
i told him of hercule_poirot intense excitement on hearing that dr_bauerstein had been at styles on the fatal night and added he said twice that alters everything
hercule_poirot does he how do you know and i ve been thinking you know mrs_inglethorp said he had put down the coffee in the hall
well it was just then that dr_bauerstein arrived isnt it possible that as mrs_inglethorp brought him through the hall the doctor dropped something into the coffee in passing
m said mr_john_cavendish it would have been very risky yes but it was possible and then how could he know it was her coffee
no old fellow i dont think that will wash but i had remembered something else you re quite right that wasnt how it was done
listen and i then told him of the cocoa sample which hercule_poirot had taken to be analysed mr_john_cavendish interrupted just as i had done
but look here dr_bauerstein had had it analysed already yes yes that the point i didnt see it either until now
if dr_bauerstein the murderer nothing could be simpler than for him to substitute some ordinary cocoa for his sample and send that to be tested
dont you understand dr_bauerstein had it analysed that just it and of course they would find no strychnine but no one would dream of suspecting dr_bauerstein or think of taking another sample except hercule_poirot i added with belated recognition
yes but what about the bitter taste that cocoa wont disguise well we ve only his word for that
and there are other possibilities he admittedly one of the world greatest toxicologists one of the world greatest what say it again
he knows more about poisons than almost anybody i explained well my idea is that perhaps he found some way of making strychnine tasteless
or it may not have been strychnine at all but some obscure drug no one has ever heard of which produces much the same symptoms
m yes that might be said mr_john_cavendish but look here how could he have got at the cocoa that wasnt downstairs
no it wasnt i admitted reluctantly and then suddenly a dreadful possibility flashed through my mind i hoped and prayed it would not occur to mr_john_cavendish also
he was frowning perplexedly and i drew a deep breath of relief for the terrible thought that had flashed across my mind was this that dr_bauerstein might have had an accomplice
i glanced sideways at him yet surely it could not be surely no woman as beautiful as mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish could be a murderess
and suddenly i remembered that first conversation at tea on the day of my arrival and the gleam in her eyes as she had said that poison was a woman weapon
yet beautiful women had been known to poison how agitated she had been on that fatal tuesday evening had mrs_inglethorp discovered something between her and dr_bauerstein and threatened to tell her husband
was it to stop that denunciation that the crime had been committed then i remembered that enigmatical conversation between hercule_poirot and evelyn_howard
was this what they had meant was this the monstrous possibility that evelyn_howard had tried not to believe yes it all fitted in
no wonder miss_howard had suggested hushing it up now i understood that unfinished sentence of hers emily herself and in my heart i agreed with her
would not mrs_inglethorp have preferred to go unavenged rather than have such terrible dishonour fall upon the name of mr_john_cavendish
there another thing said mr_john_cavendish suddenly and the unexpected sound of his voice made me start guiltily something which makes me doubt if what you say can be true
i asked thankful that he had gone away from the subject of how the poison could have been introduced into the cocoa
what that why the fact that dr_bauerstein demanded a post mortem he neednt have done so little dr_wilkins would have been quite content to let it go at heart disease
yes i said doubtfully but we dont know perhaps he thought it safer in the long run someone might have talked afterwards
the whole thing would have come out then and he would have been in an awkward position for no one would have believed that a man of his reputation could have been deceived into calling it heart disease
then the home office might have ordered exhumation yes that possible admitted mr_john_cavendish still he added i blest if i can see what his motive could have been
i trembled look here i said i may be altogether wrong and remember all this is in confidence
oh of course that goes without saying we had walked as we talked and now we passed through the little gate into the garden
voices rose near at hand for tea was spread out under the sycamore tree as it had been on the day of my arrival
mademoiselle_cynthia was back from the hospital and i placed my chair beside her and told her of hercule_poirot wish to visit the dispensary
of course i love him to see it he better come to tea there one day i must fix it up with him
he made me take the brooch out of my tie the other day and put it in again because he said it wasnt straight
he such a dear little man but he is funny i laughed it quite a mania with him yes isnt it
we were silent for a minute or two and then glancing in the direction of mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish and dropping her voice mademoiselle_cynthia said mr_hastings
yes after tea i want to talk to you her glance at mary_cavendish had set me thinking i fancied that between these two there existed very little sympathy
mrs_inglethorp had made no provisions of any kind for her but i imagined that mr_john_cavendish and mary_cavendish would probably insist on her making her home with them at any rate until the end of the war
for the first time it occurred to me to wonder about the girl future mr_john_cavendish i knew was very fond of her and would be sorry to let her go
mr_john_cavendish who had gone into the house now reappeared his good natured face wore an unaccustomed frown of anger confound those detectives
i cant think what they re after they ve been in every room in the house turning things inside out and upside down it really is too bad
i suppose they took advantage of our all being out i shall go for that fellow japp when i next see him
lot of paul prys grunted miss_howard monsieur_lawrence opined that they had to make a show of doing something mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish said nothing
after tea i invited mademoiselle_cynthia to come for a walk and we sauntered off into the woods together well i inquired as soon as we were protected from prying eyes by the leafy screen
with a sigh mademoiselle_cynthia flung herself down and tossed off her hat the sunlight piercing through the branches turned the auburn of her hair to quivering gold
mr_hastings you are always so kind and you know such a lot it struck me at this moment that mademoiselle_cynthia was really a very charming girl
much more charming than mary_cavendish who never said things of that kind well i asked benignantly as she hesitated
i want to ask your advice what shall i do do yes you see aunt emily always told me i should be provided for
i suppose she forgot or didnt think she was likely to die anyway i am not provided for and i dont know what to do
do you think i ought to go away from here at once good heavens no they dont want to part with you i sure
mademoiselle_cynthia hesitated a moment plucking up the grass with her tiny hand then she said mrs mr_john_cavendish does she hates me
hates you i cried astonished mademoiselle_cynthia nodded yes i dont know why but she cant bear me and he cant either
there i know you re wrong i said warmly on the contrary mr_john_cavendish is very fond of you
oh yes mr_john_cavendish i meant monsieur_lawrence not of course that i care whether monsieur_lawrence hates me or not still it rather horrid when no one loves you isnt it
but they do mademoiselle_cynthia dear i said earnestly i sure you are mistaken look there is mr_john_cavendish and miss_howard mademoiselle_cynthia nodded rather gloomily
yes mr_john_cavendish likes me i think and of course evie for all her gruff way wouldnt be unkind to a fly
but monsieur_lawrence never speaks to me if he can help it and mary_cavendish can hardly bring herself to be civil to me
she wants evie to stay on is begging her to but she doesnt want me and and i dont know what to do
her beauty perhaps as she sat there with the sunlight glinting down on her head perhaps the sense of relief at encountering someone who so obviously could have no connection with the tragedy perhaps honest pity for her youth and loneliness
suddenly the poor child burst out crying i dont know what possessed me anyway i leant forward and taking her little hand i said awkwardly
marry me mademoiselle_cynthia unwittingly i had hit upon a sovereign remedy for her tears she sat up at once drew her hand away and said with some asperity dont be silly
i was a little annoyed i not being silly i am asking you to do me the honour of becoming my wife
to my intense surprise mademoiselle_cynthia burst out laughing and called me a funny dear it perfectly sweet of you she said but
you know you dont want to yes i do i ve got never mind what you ve got you dont really want to and i dont either
well of course that settles it i said stiffly but i dont see anything to laugh at there nothing funny about a proposal
no indeed said mademoiselle_cynthia somebody might accept you next time good bye you ve cheered me up very much
and with a final uncontrollable burst of merriment she vanished through the trees thinking over the interview it struck me as being profoundly unsatisfactory
it occurred to me suddenly that i would go down to the village and look up dr_bauerstein somebody ought to be keeping an eye on the fellow
at the same time it would be wise to allay any suspicions he might have as to his being suspected i remembered how hercule_poirot had relied on my diplomacy
accordingly i went to the little house with the apartments card inserted in the window where i knew he lodged and tapped on the door
an old woman came and opened it good afternoon i said pleasantly is dr_bauerstein in she stared at me
havent you heard heard what about him what about him he took took dead no took by the perlice
by the police i gasped do you mean they ve arrested him yes that it and i waited to hear no more but tore up the village to find hercule_poirot
to my extreme annoyance hercule_poirot was not in and the old belgian who answered my knock informed me that he believed he had gone to london
was it a sudden decision on his part or had he already made up his mind when he parted from me a few hours earlier
chapter the arrest i was dumbfounded what on earth could hercule_poirot be doing in london i retraced my steps to styles in some annoyance
with hercule_poirot away i was uncertain how to act had he foreseen this arrest had he not in all probability been the cause of it
those questions i could not resolve but in the meantime what was i to do should i announce the arrest openly at styles or not
though i did not acknowledge it to myself the thought of mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish was weighing on me would it not be a terrible shock to her
for the moment i set aside utterly any suspicions of her she could not be implicated otherwise i should have heard some hint of it
of course there was no possibility of being able permanently to conceal dr_bauerstein arrest from her it would be announced in every newspaper on the morrow
still i shrank from blurting it out if only hercule_poirot had been accessible i could have asked his advice what possessed him to go posting off to london in this unaccountable way
in spite of myself my opinion of his sagacity was immeasurably heightened i would never have dreamt of suspecting the doctor had not hercule_poirot put it into my head
after some reflecting i decided to take mr_john_cavendish into my confidence and leave him to make the matter public or not as he thought fit
yes decidedly the little man was clever he gave vent to a prodigious whistle as i imparted the news great scot
you were right then i couldnt believe it at the time no it is astonishing until you get used to the idea and see how it makes everything fit in
now what are we to do of course it will be generally known to morrow mr_john_cavendish reflected never mind he said at last we wont say anything at present
but to my intense surprise on getting down early the next morning and eagerly opening the newspapers there was not a word about the arrest
there is no need as you say it will be known soon enough there was a column of mere padding about the styles poisoning case but nothing further
it was rather inexplicable but i supposed that for some reason or other japp wished to keep it out of the paper
after breakfast i decided to go down to the village and see if hercule_poirot had returned yet but before i could start a well known face blocked one of the windows and the well known voice said bonjour mon ami
it worried me just a little for it suggested the possibility that there might be further arrest to come hercule_poirot i exclaimed with relief and seizing him by both hand i dragged him into the room
i was never so glad to see anyone listen i have said nothing to anybody but mr_john_cavendish is that right
my friend replied hercule_poirot i do not know what you are talking about dr_bauerstein arrest of course i answered impatiently
is dr_bauerstein arrested then did you not know it not the least in the world but pausing a moment he added still it does not surprise me
after all we are only four miles from the coast the coast i asked puzzled what has that got to do with it
no doubt i am very dense but i cannot see what the proximity of the coast has got to do with the murder of mrs_inglethorp
hercule_poirot shrugged his shoulders surely it is obvious not to me nothing at all of course replied hercule_poirot smiling
but we were speaking of the arrest of dr_bauerstein well he is arrested for the murder of mrs_inglethorp
what cried hercule_poirot in apparently lively astonishment dr_bauerstein arrested for the murder of mrs_inglethorp yes impossible that would be too good a farce
who told you that my friend well no one exactly told me i confessed but he is arrested
oh yes very likely but for espionage mon ami espionage i gasped precisely not for poisoning mrs_inglethorp
not unless our friend japp has taken leave of his senses replied hercule_poirot placidly but but i thought you thought so too
hercule_poirot gave me one look which conveyed a wondering pity and his full sense of the utter absurdity of such an idea
do you mean to say i asked slowly adapting myself to the new idea that dr_bauerstein is a spy
it did not strike you as peculiar that a famous london doctor should bury himself in a little village like this and should be in the habit of walking about at all hours of the night fully dressed
hercule_poirot nodded have you never suspected it it never entered my head no i confessed i never thought of such a thing
he is of course a german by birth said hercule_poirot thoughtfully though he has practiced so long in this country that nobody thinks of him as anything but an englishman
he was naturalized about fifteen year ago a very clever man a jew of course the blackguard i cried indignantly
not at all he is on the contrary a patriot think what he stands to lose i admire the man myself
but i could not look at it in hercule_poirot philosophical way and this is the man with whom mrs mr_john_cavendish has been wandering about all over the country
i cried indignantly yes i should fancy he had found her very useful remarked hercule_poirot so long as gossip busied itself in coupling their names together any other vagaries of the doctor passed unobserved
then you think he never really cared for her i asked eagerly rather too eagerly perhaps under the circumstances
that of course i cannot say but shall i tell you my own private opinion mr_hastings yes well it is this that mrs mr_john_cavendish does not care and never has cared one little jot about dr_bauerstein
do you really think so i could not disguise my pleasure i am quite sure of it and i will tell you why
yes because she cares for someone else mon ami oh what did he mean in spite of myself an agreeable warmth spread over me
i am not a vain man where women are concerned but i remembered certain evidences too lightly thought of at the time perhaps but which certainly seemed to indicate
she glanced round hastily to make sure there was no one else in the room and quickly produced an old sheet of brown paper
my pleasing thoughts were interrupted by the sudden entrance of miss_howard this she handed to hercule_poirot murmuring as she did so the cryptic words
on top of the wardrobe then she hurriedly left the room hercule_poirot unfolded the sheet of paper eagerly and uttered an exclamation of satisfaction
he spread it out on the table come here mr_hastings now tell me what is that initial or it was a medium sized sheet of paper rather dusty as though it had lain by for some time
at the top it bore the printed stamp of messrs parkson the well known theatrical costumiers and it was addressed to the debatable initial mr_john_cavendish esq styles court styles st mary_cavendish essex
but it was the label that was attracting hercule_poirot attention it might bet or it might be i said after studying the thing for a minute or two
it certainly isnt a good replied hercule_poirot folding up the paper again i also am of your way of thinking
it is an depend upon it where did it come from i asked curiously is it important moderately so
it confirms a surmise of mine having deduced its existence i set miss_howard to search for it and as you see she has been successful
what did she mean by on the top of the wardrobe she meant replied hercule_poirot promptly that she found it on top of a wardrobe
a funny place for a piece of brown paper i mused not at all the top of a wardrobe is an excellent place for brown paper and cardboard boxes
i have kept them there myself neatly arranged there is nothing to offend the eye hercule_poirot i asked earnestly have you made up your mind about this crime
yes that is to say i believe i know how it was committed ah unfortunately i have no proof beyond my surmise unless
with sudden energy he caught me by the arm and whirled me down the hall calling out in french in his excitement mademoiselle_cynthia mademoiselle_dorcas mademoiselle_cynthia mademoiselle_dorcas un moment il vous plaît
mademoiselle_dorcas quite flurried by the noise came hurrying out of the pantry my good mademoiselle_dorcas i have an idea a little idea if it should prove justified what magnificent chance
tell me on monday not tuesday mademoiselle_dorcas but monday the day before the tragedy did anything go wrong with mrs_inglethorp bell
mademoiselle_dorcas looked very surprised yes sir now you mention it it did though i dont know how you came to hear of it
a mouse or some such must have nibbled the wire through the man came and put it right on tuesday morning
with a long drawn exclamation of ecstasy hercule_poirot led the way back to the morning room see you one should not ask for outside proof no reason should be enough
but the flesh is weak it is consolation to find that one is on the right track ah my friend i am like a giant refreshed
i run i leap and in very truth run and leap he did gambolling wildly down the stretch of lawn outside the long window
what is your remarkable little friend doing asked a voice behind me and i turned to find mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish at my elbow
he asked mademoiselle_dorcas some question about a bell and appeared so delighted with her answer that he is capering about as you see
she smiled and so did i what is it all about really i cant tell you mary_cavendish laughed how ridiculous
he going out of the gate isnt he coming back to day i dont know i ve given up trying to guess what he ll do next
sometimes i feel sure he is as mad as a hatter and then just as he is at his maddest i find there is method in his madness
is he quite mad mr_hastings i honestly dont know i see in spite of her laugh mary_cavendish was looking thoughtful this morning
she seemed grave almost sad it occurred to me that it would be a good opportunity to tackle her on the subject of mademoiselle_cynthia
you are an excellent advocate i have no doubt mr_hastings but in this case your talents are quite thrown away
i began rather tactfully i thought but i had not gone far before she stopped me authoritatively mademoiselle_cynthia will run no risk of encountering any unkindness from me
but again she stopped me and her words were so unexpected that they quite drove mademoiselle_cynthia and her troubles out of my mind
i began to stammer feebly that i hoped she hadnt thought mr_hastings she said do you think i and my husband are happy together
i was considerably taken aback and murmured something about it not being my business to think anything of the sort
well she said quietly whether it is your business or not i will tell you that we are not happy
she began slowly walking up and down the room her head a little bent and that slim supple figure of hers swaying gently as she walked
i said nothing for i saw that she had not finished she stopped suddenly and looked up at me
you dont know anything about me do you she asked where i come from who i was before i married mr_john_cavendish anything in fact
well i will tell you i will make a father confessor of you you are kind i think yes i am sure you are kind
somehow i was not quite as elated as i might have been i remembered that mademoiselle_cynthia had begun her confidences in much the same way
besides a father confessor should be elderly it is not at all the role for a young man my father was english said mrs mr_john_cavendish but my mother was a russian
ah i said now i understand understand what a hint of something foreign different that there has always been about you
my mother was very beautiful i believe i dont know because i never saw her she died when i was quite a little child
i believe there was some tragedy connected with her death she took an overdose of some sleeping draught by mistake however that may be my father was broken hearted
shortly afterwards he went into the consular service everywhere he went i went with him when i was twenty three i had been nearly all over the world
it was a splendid life i loved it there was a smile on her face and her head was thrown back
she seemed living in the memory of those old glad day then my father died he left me very badly off
you will understand me when i say that it was a deadly life for a girl brought up as i had been
i had to go and live with some old aunts in yorkshire she shuddered the narrowness the deadly monotony of it almost drove me mad
she paused a minute and added in a different tone and then i met mr_john_cavendish yes you can imagine that from my aunts point of view it was a very good match for me
but i can honestly say it was not this fact which weighed with me no he was simply a way of escape from the insufferable monotony of my life
i told him what was true that i liked him very much that i hoped to come to like him more but that i was not in any way what the world calls in love with him
i said nothing and after a moment she went on dont misunderstand me i was quite honest with him he declared that that satisfied him and so we were married
she waited a long time a little frown had gathered on her forehead she seemed to be looking back earnestly into those past day
i think i am sure he cared for me at first but i suppose we were not well matched almost at once we drifted apart
he it is not a pleasing thing for my pride but it is the truth tired of me very soon i must have made some murmur of dissent for she went on quickly oh yes he did
not that it matters now now that we ve come to the parting of the way what do you mean
she answered quietly i mean that i am not going to remain at styles you and mr_john_cavendish are not going to live here
mr_john_cavendish may live here but i shall not you are going to leave him yes but why she paused a long time and said at last
and as she spoke i had a sudden vision of broad spaces virgin tracts of forests untrodden lands and a realization of what freedom would mean to such a nature as mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish
i seemed to see her for a moment as she was a proud wild creature as untamed by civilization as some shy bird of the hills
a little cry broke from her lips you dont know you dont know how this hateful place has been prison to me
perhaps because i want to be free i understand i said but but dont do anything rash oh rash her voice mocked at my prudence
then suddenly i said a thing i could have bitten out my tongue for you know that dr_bauerstein has been arrested
an instant coldness passed like a mask over her face blotting out all expression mr_john_cavendish was so kind as to break that to me this morning
well what do you think i asked feebly of what of the arrest what should i think
apparently he is a german spy so the gardener had told mr_john_cavendish her face and voice were absolutely cold and expressionless
did she care or did she not she moved away a step or two and fingered one of the flower vases
these are quite dead i must do them again would you mind moving thank you mr_hastings and she walked quietly past me out of the window with a cool little nod of dismissal
no surely she could not care for dr_bauerstein no woman could act her part with that icy unconcern hercule_poirot did not make his appearance the following morning and there was no sign of the scotland yard man
but at lunch time there arrived a new piece of evidence or rather lack of evidence we had vainly tried to trace the fourth letter which mrs_inglethorp had written on the evening preceding her death
our efforts having been in vain we had abandoned the matter hoping that it might turn up of itself one day
and this is just what did happen in the shape of a communication which arrived by the second post from a firm of french music publishers acknowledging mrs_inglethorp cheque and regretting they had been unable to trace a certain series of russian folksongs
so the last hope of solving the mystery by means of mrs_inglethorp correspondence on the fatal evening had to be abandoned
just before tea i strolled down to tell hercule_poirot of the new disappointment but found to my annoyance that he was once more out
gone to london again oh no monsieur he has but taken the train to tadminster to see a young lady dispensary he said
silly ass i ejaculated i told him wednesday was the one day she wasnt there well tell him to look us up to morrow morning will you
certainly monsieur but on the following day no sign of hercule_poirot i was getting angry he was really treating us in the most cavalier fashion
after lunch monsieur_lawrence drew me aside and asked if i was going down to see him no i dont think i shall
he can come up here if he wants to see us oh monsieur_lawrence looked indeterminate something unusually nervous and excited in his manner roused my curiosity
it nothing much but well if you are going will you tell him he dropped his voice to a whisper i think i ve found the extra coffee cup
what is it i asked i could go if there anything special i had almost forgotten that enigmatical message of hercule_poirot but now my curiosity was aroused afresh
monsieur_lawrence would say no more so i decided that i would descend from my high horse and once more seek out hercule_poirot at leastways cottage
this time i was received with a smile monsieur hercule_poirot was within would i mount i mounted accordingly hercule_poirot was sitting by the table his head buried in his hand
he sprang up at my entrance what is it i asked solicitously you are not ill i trust
no no not ill but i decide an affair of great moment whether to catch the criminal or not
i asked facetiously but to my great surprise hercule_poirot nodded gravely to speak or not to speak as your so great shakespeare says that is the question
i did not trouble to correct the quotation you are not serious hercule_poirot i am of the most serious
for the most serious of all things hangs in the balance and that is a woman happiness mon ami he said gravely
i did not quite know what to say the moment has come said hercule_poirot thoughtfully and i do not know what to do
for see you it is a big stake for which i play no one but i hercule_poirot would attempt it
and he tapped himself proudly on the breast after pausing a few minutes respectfully so as not to spoil his effect i gave him monsieur_lawrence message
aha he cried so he has found the extra coffee cup that is good he has more intelligence than would appear this long faced monsieur_lawrence of yours
i did not myself think very highly of monsieur_lawrence intelligence but i forebore to contradict hercule_poirot and gently took him to task for forgetting my instructions as to which were mademoiselle_cynthia day off
it is true i have the head of a sieve however the other young lady was most kind she was sorry for my disappointment and showed me everything in the kindest way
oh well that all right then and you must go to tea with mademoiselle_cynthia another day i told him about the letter
i am sorry for that he said i always had hopes of that letter but no it was not to be
this affair must all be unravelled from within he tapped his forehead these little grey cells it is up to them as you say over here
no i said rather surprised i know that there are no two finger marks alike but that as far as my science goes
then suddenly he asked are you a judge of finger marks my friend exactly he unlocked a little drawer and took out some photographs which he laid on the table
i have numbered them will you describe them to me i studied the proofs attentively
all greatly magnified i see no i should say are a man finger prints thumb and first finger no are a lady they are much smaller and quite different in every way
no i paused for some time there seem to be a lot of confused finger marks but here very distinctly are no
overlapping the others yes you recognize them beyond fail oh yes they are identical hercule_poirot nodded and gently taking the photographs from me locked them up again
i suppose i said that as usual you are not going to explain on the contrary no were the finger prints of monsieur_lawrence
no were those of mademoiselle_cynthia they are not important i merely obtained them for comparison no is a little more complicated
yes it is as you see highly magnified you may have noticed a sort of blur extending all across the picture
it is a well known process to the police and by means of it you can obtain a photograph of the finger prints of any object in a very short space of time
well my friend you have seen the finger marks it remains to tell you the particular object on which they had been left
i will not describe to you the special apparatus dusting powder etc which i used go on i am really excited eh bien
no represents the highly magnified surface of a tiny bottle in the top poison cupboard of the dispensary in the red cross hospital at tadminster which sounds like the house that jack built
photo good heavens i exclaimed but what were monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish finger marks doing on it he never went near the poison cupboard the day we were there
oh yes he did impossible we were all together the whole time hercule_poirot shook his head no my friend there was a moment when you were not all together
there was a moment when you could not have been all together or it would not have been necessary to call to monsieur_lawrence to come and join you on the balcony
i forgotten that i admitted but it was only for a moment long enough long enough for what
hercule_poirot smile became rather enigmatical long enough for a gentleman who had once studied medicine to gratify a very natural interest and curiosity
our eyes met hercule_poirot were pleasantly vague he got up and hummed a little tune i watched him suspiciously
hercule_poirot i said what was in this particular little bottle hercule_poirot looked out of the window hydro chloride of strychnine he said over his shoulder continuing to hum
good heavens i said it quite quietly i was not surprised i had expected that answer they use the pure hydro chloride of strychnine very little only occasionally for pills
it is the official solution liq strychnine hydro clor that is used in most medicines that is why the finger marks have remained undisturbed since then
visitors were not permitted below at that hour so in spite of my many apologies mademoiselle_cynthia colleague had to go down and fetch it for me
how did you manage to take this photograph i dropped my hat from the balcony explained hercule_poirot simply then you knew what you were going to find
no not at all i merely realized that it was possible from your story for monsieur_lawrence to go to the poison cupboard
the possibility had to be confirmed or eliminated hercule_poirot i said your gaiety does not deceive me this is a very important discovery
i do not know said hercule_poirot but one thing does strike me no doubt it has struck you too
what is that why that there is altogether too much strychnine about this case this is the third time we run up against it
there was strychnine in mrs_inglethorp tonic there is the strychnine sold across the counter at styles st mary_cavendish by mr_mace
now we have more strychnine handled by one of the household it is confusing and as you know i do not like confusion
before i could reply one of the other belgians opened the door and stuck his head in there is a lady below asking for mr_hastings
a lady i jumped up hercule_poirot followed me down the narrow stairs mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish was standing in the doorway
i have been visiting an old woman in the village she explained and as monsieur_lawrence told me you were with monsieur hercule_poirot
i thought i would call for you alas madame said hercule_poirot i thought you had come to honour me with a visit
i will some day if you ask me she promised him smiling that is well if you should need a father confessor madame she started ever so slightly remember papa hercule_poirot is always at your service
she stared at him for a few minutes as though seeking to read some deeper meaning into his words then she turned abruptly away
come will you not walk back with us too monsieur hercule_poirot enchanted madame all the way to styles mary_cavendish talked fast and feverishly
it struck me that in some way she was nervous of hercule_poirot eyes the weather had broken and the sharp wind was almost autumnal in its shrewishness
mary_cavendish shivered a little and buttoned her black sports coat closer the wind through the trees made a mournful noise like some great giant sighing
we walked up to the great door of styles and at once the knowledge came to us that something was wrong
mademoiselle_dorcas came running out to meet us she was crying and wringing her hand i was aware of other servants huddled together in the background all eyes and ears
oh am oh am i dont know how to tell you what is it mademoiselle_dorcas i asked impatiently
tell us at once it those wicked detectives they ve arrested him they ve arrested mr_john_cavendish arrested monsieur_lawrence i gasped
i saw a strange look come into mademoiselle_dorcas eyes no sir not mr monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish behind me with a wild cry mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish fell heavily against me and as i turned to catch her
i met the quiet triumph in hercule_poirot eyes chapter xi the case for the prosecution the trial of mr_john_cavendish for the murder of his stepmother took place two months later
she ranged herself passionately on her husband side scorning the mere idea of his guilt and fought for him tooth and nail
of the intervening weeks i will say little but my admiration and sympathy went out unfeignedly to mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish i expressed my admiration to hercule_poirot and he nodded thoughtfully
yes she is of those women who show at their best in adversity it brings out all that is sweetest and truest in them
her pride and her jealousy have jealousy i queried yes have you not realized that she is an unusually jealous woman
as i was saying her pride and jealousy have been laid aside she thinks of nothing but her husband and the terrible fate that is hanging over him
he spoke very feelingly and i looked at him earnestly remembering that last afternoon when he had been deliberating whether or not to speak
with his tenderness for a woman happiness i felt glad that the decision had been taken out of his hand
even now i said i can hardly believe it you see up to the very last minute i thought it was monsieur_lawrence
hercule_poirot grinned i know you did but mr_john_cavendish my old friend mr_john_cavendish every murderer is probably somebody old friend observed hercule_poirot philosophically
you cannot mix up sentiment and reason i must say i think you might have given me a hint perhaps mon ami i did not do so just because he was your old friend
i was rather disconcerted by this remembering how i had busily passed on to mr_john_cavendish what i believed to be hercule_poirot view concerning dr_bauerstein
nevertheless although he had been too clever for them this time and the charge of espionage could not be brought home to him his wings were pretty well clipped for the future
he by the way had been acquitted of the charge brought against him i asked hercule_poirot whether he thought mr_john_cavendish would be condemned
to my intense surprise he replied that on the contrary he was extremely likely to be acquitted but hercule_poirot i protested
oh my friend have i not said to you all along that i have no proofs it is one thing to know that a man is guilty it is quite another matter to prove him so
and in this case there is terribly little evidence that is the whole trouble i hercule_poirot know but i lack the last link in my chain
and unless i can find that missing link he shook his head gravely when did you first suspect mr_john_cavendish
not after that fragment of conversation you overheard between mrs mr_john_cavendish and her mother in law and her subsequent lack of frankness at the inquest
did you not put two and two together and reflect that if it was not mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp who was quarrelling with his wife and you remember he strenuously denied it at the inquest it must be either monsieur_lawrence or mr_john_cavendish
i asked after a minute or two did you not suspect him at all no indeed no now if it was monsieur_lawrence mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish conduct was just as inexplicable
but if on the other hand it was mr_john_cavendish the whole thing was explained quite naturally so i cried a light breaking in upon me it was mr_john_cavendish who quarrelled with his mother that afternoon
exactly and you have known this all along certainly mrs mr_john_cavendish behaviour could only be explained that way and yet you say he may be acquitted
at the police court proceedings we shall hear the case for the prosecution but in all probability his solicitors will advise him to reserve his defence
hercule_poirot shrugged his shoulders certainly i do that will be sprung upon us at the trial and ah by the way i have a word of caution to give you my friend
i must not appear in the case what no officially i have nothing to do with it until i have found that last link in my chain i must remain behind the scenes
mrs mr_john_cavendish must think i am working for her husband not against him i say that playing it a bit low down i protested
we have to deal with a most clever and unscrupulous man and we must use any means in our power otherwise he will slip through our fingers
not at all that is why i have been careful to remain in the background all the discoveries have been made by japp and japp will take all the credit
if i am called upon to give evidence at all he smiled broadly it will probably be as a witness for the defence
i could hardly believe my ears it is quite en règle continued hercule_poirot strangely enough i can give evidence that will demolish one contention of the prosecution
which one the one that relates to the destruction of the will mr_john_cavendish did not destroy that will
hercule_poirot was a true prophet i will not go into the details of the police court proceedings as it involves many tiresome repetitions
i will merely state baldly that mr_john_cavendish reserved his defence and was duly committed for trial september found us all in london
mary_cavendish took a house in kensington hercule_poirot being included in the family party i myself had been given a job at the war office so was able to see them continually
as the weeks went by the state of hercule_poirot nerves grew worse and worse that last link he talked about was still lacking
privately i hoped it might remain so for what happiness could there be for mary_cavendish if mr_john_cavendish were not acquitted on september th
mr_john_cavendish appeared in the dock at the old bailey charged with the wilful murder of emily agnes mrs_inglethorp and pleaded not guilty
sir ernest_heavywether the famous c had been engaged to defend him mr philips c opened the case for the crown
it was neither more nor less than the deliberate poisoning of a fond and trusting woman by the stepson to whom she had been more than a mother
the murder he said was a most premeditated and cold blooded one ever since his boyhood she had supported him he and his wife had lived at styles court in every luxury surrounded by her care and attention
he proposed to call witness to show how the prisoner a profligate and spendthrift had been at the end of his financial tether and had also been carrying on an intrigue with a certain mrs_raikes a neighbouring farmer wife
this having come to his stepmother ears she taxed him with it on the afternoon before her death and a quarrel ensued part of which was overheard
on the previous day the prisoner had purchased strychnine at the village chemist shop wearing a disguise by means of which he hoped to throw the onus of the crime upon another man to wit mrs_inglethorp husband of whom he had been bitterly jealous
she had been their kind and generous benefactress luckily for mr mrs_inglethorp he had been able to produce an unimpeachable alibi
on the afternoon of july th continued counsel immediately after the quarrel with her son mrs_inglethorp made a new will
this will was found destroyed in the grate of her bedroom the following morning but evidence had come to light which showed that it had been drawn up in favour of her husband
deceased had already made a will in his favour before her marriage but and mr philips wagged an expressive forefinger the prisoner was not aware of that
what had induced the deceased to make a fresh will with the old one still extant he could not say she was an old lady and might possibly have forgotten the former one or
this seemed to him more likely she may have had an idea that it was revoked by her marriage as there had been some conversation on the subject
ladies were not always very well versed in legal knowledge she had about a year before executed a will in favour of the prisoner
he would call evidence to show that it was the prisoner who ultimately handed his stepmother her coffee on the fatal night
later in the evening he had sought admission to her room on which occasion no doubt he found an opportunity of destroying the will which as far as he knew would render the one in his favour valid
the prisoner had been arrested in consequence of the discovery in his room by detective inspector japp a most brilliant officer of the identical phial of strychnine which had been sold at the village chemist to the supposed mr mrs_inglethorp on the day before the murder
it would be for the jury to decide whether or not these damning facts constituted an overwhelming proof of the prisoner guilt
and subtly implying that a jury which did not so decide was quite unthinkable mr philips sat down and wiped his forehead
the first witness for the prosecution were mostly those who had been called at the inquest the medical evidence being again taken first
sir ernest_heavywether who was famous all over england for the unscrupulous manner in which he bullied witness only asked two questions
i take it dr_bauerstein that strychnine as a drug acts quickly yes and that you are unable to account for the delay in this case
yes thank you mr_mace identified the phial handed him by counsel as that sold by him to mr mrs_inglethorp
pressed he admitted that he only knew mr mrs_inglethorp by sight he had never spoken to him the witness was not cross examined
mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp was called and denied having purchased the poison he also denied having quarrelled with his wife various witness testified to the accuracy of these statements
mademoiselle_dorcas faithful to her young gentlemen denied strenuously that it could have been mr_john_cavendish voice she heard and resolutely declared in the teeth of everything that it was mr mrs_inglethorp who had been in the boudoir with her mistress
the gardeners evidence as to the witnessing of the will was taken and then mademoiselle_dorcas was called a rather wistful smile passed across the face of the prisoner in the dock
he knew only too well how useless her gallant defiance was since it was not the object of the defence to deny this point
after various questions on other matters mr philips asked in the month of june last do you remember a parcel arriving for mr monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish from parkson
mrs mr_john_cavendish of course could not be called upon to give evidence against her husband mademoiselle_dorcas shook her head i dont remember sir
it may have done but mr monsieur_lawrence was away from home part of june in the event of a parcel arriving for him whilst he was away what would be done with it
it would either be put in his room or sent on after him by you no sir i should leave it on the hall table
it would be miss_howard who would attend to anything like that evelyn_howard was called and after being examined on other points was questioned as to the parcel
you do not know if it was sent after mr monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish to wales or whether it was put in his room
dont remember lots of parcels come cant remember one special one dont think it was sent after him should have remembered it if it was
supposing a parcel arrived addressed to mr monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish and afterwards it disappeared should you remark its absence no dont think so
i should think someone had taken charge of it i believe miss_howard that it was you who found this sheet of brown paper
he held up the same dusty piece which hercule_poirot and i had examined in the morning room at styles yes i did
how did you come to look for it the belgian detective who was employed on the case asked me to search for it
where did you eventually discover it on the top of of a wardrobe on top of the prisoner wardrobe i i believe so
did you not find it yourself yes then you must know where you found it yes it was on the prisoner wardrobe
an assistant from parkson theatrical costumiers testified that on june th they had supplied a black beard to mr_john_cavendish as requested
that is better it was ordered by letter and a postal order was enclosed no they had not kept the letter
all transactions were entered in their books they had sent the beard as directed to mr_john_cavendish esq styles court
sir ernest_heavywether rose ponderously where was the letter written from from styles court the same address to which you sent the parcel
yes and the letter came from there yes like a beast of prey ernest_heavywether fell upon him how do you know
i i dont understand how do you know that letter came from styles did you notice the postmark no but
ah you did not notice the postmark and yet you affirm so confidently that it came from styles it might in fact have been any postmark
es in fact the letter though written on stamped notepaper might have been posted from anywhere from wales for instance
elizabeth mr_wells second housemaid at styles stated that after she had gone to bed she remembered that she had bolted the front door instead of leaving it on the latch as mr mrs_inglethorp had requested
the witness admitted that such might be the case and sir ernest_heavywether signified that he was satisfied she had accordingly gone downstairs again to rectify her error
hearing a slight noise in the west wing she had peeped along the passage and had seen mr_john_cavendish knocking at mrs_inglethorp door
sir ernest_heavywether made short work of her and under his unmerciful bullying she contradicted herself hopelessly and sir ernest_heavywether sat down again with a satisfied smile on his face
with the evidence of annie as to the candle grease on the floor and as to seeing the prisoner take the coffee into the boudoir the proceedings were adjourned until the following day
as we went home mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish spoke bitterly against the prosecuting counsel that hateful man what a net he has drawn around my poor mr_john_cavendish
how he twisted every little fact until he made it seem what it wasnt well i said consolingly it will be the other way about to morrow
yes she said meditatively then suddenly dropped her voice mr_hastings you do not think surely it could not have been monsieur_lawrence
oh no that could not be but i myself was puzzled and as soon as i was alone with hercule_poirot i asked him what he thought sir ernest_heavywether was driving at
ah said hercule_poirot appreciatively he is a clever man that sir ernest_heavywether do you think he believes monsieur_lawrence guilty
no what he is trying for is to create such confusion in the minds of the jury that they are divided in their opinion as to which brother did it
he is endeavouring to make out that there is quite as much evidence against monsieur_lawrence as against mr_john_cavendish and i am not at all sure that he will not succeed
i do not think he believes or cares anything detective inspector japp was the first witness called when the trial was reopened and gave his evidence succinctly and briefly
after relating the earlier events he proceeded acting on information received superintendent summerhaye and myself searched the prisoner room during his temporary absence from the house
in his chest of drawers hidden beneath some underclothing we found first a pair of gold rimmed pince nez similar to those worn by mr mrs_inglethorp these were exhibited secondly this phial
the phial was that already recognized by the chemist assistant a tiny bottle of blue glass containing a few grains of a white crystalline powder and labelled strychnine hydrochloride
a fresh piece of evidence discovered by the detectives since the police court proceedings was a long almost new piece of blotting paper
it had been found in mrs_inglethorp cheque book and on being reversed at a mirror showed clearly the words erything of which i die possessed i leave to my beloved husband mr_alfred_inglethorp ing this placed beyond question the fact that the destroyed will had been in favour of the deceased lady husband
japp then produced the charred fragment of paper recovered from the grate and this with the discovery of the beard in the attic completed his evidence
poison but sir ernest_heavywether cross examination was yet to come what day was it when you searched the prisoner room
tuesday the th of july exactly a week after the tragedy yes you found these two objects you say in the chest of drawers
does it not strike you as unlikely that a man who had committed a crime should keep the evidence of it in an unlocked drawer for anyone to find
was the drawer unlocked yes he might have stowed them there in a hurry but you have just said it was a whole week since the crime
he would have had ample time to remove them and destroy them perhaps there is no perhaps about it
would he or would he not have had plenty of time to remove and destroy them yes was the pile of underclothes under which the things were hidden heavy or light
heavyish in other words it was winter underclothing obviously the prisoner would not be likely to go to that drawer perhaps not
would the prisoner in the hottest week of a hot summer be likely to go to a drawer containing winter underclothing
in that case is it not possible that the articles in question might have been put there by a third person and that the prisoner was quite unaware of their presence
kindly answer my question yes or no no i should not think it likely but it is possible
yes that is all more evidence followed evidence as to the financial difficulties in which the prisoner had found himself at the end of july
evidence as to his intrigue with mrs_raikes poor mary_cavendish that must have been bitter hearing for a woman of her pride
evelyn_howard had been right in her facts though her animosity against mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp had caused her to jump to the conclusion that he was the person concerned
monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish was then put into the box in a low voice in answer to mr philips questions he denied having ordered anything from parkson in june
in fact on june th he had been staying away in wales instantly sir ernest_heavywether chin was shooting pugnaciously forward
you deny having ordered a black beard from parkson on june th i do ah in the event of anything happening to your brother who will inherit styles court
the brutality of the question called a flush to monsieur_lawrence pale face the judge gave vent to a faint murmur of disapprobation and the prisoner in the dock leant forward angrily
ernest_heavywether cared nothing for his client anger answer my question if you please i suppose said monsieur_lawrence quietly that i should
what do you mean by you suppose your brother has no children you would inherit it wouldnt you yes
ah that better said ernest_heavywether with ferocious geniality and you inherit a good slice of money too wouldnt you
really sir ernest_heavywether protested the judge these questions are not relevant sir ernest_heavywether bowed and having shot his arrow proceeded
on tuesday the th july you went i believe with another guest to visit the dispensary at the red cross hospital in tadminster
yes did you while you happened to be alone for a few seconds unlock the poison cupboard and examine some of the bottle
i i may have done so i put it to you that you did do so yes sir ernest_heavywether fairly shot the next question at him
did you examine one bottle in particular no i do not think so be careful mr_john_cavendish i am referring to a little bottle of hydro chloride of strychnine
monsieur_lawrence was turning a sickly greenish colour o i am sure i didnt then how do you account for the fact that you left the unmistakable impress of your finger prints on it
the bullying manner was highly efficacious with a nervous disposition i i suppose i must have taken up the bottle
i suppose so too did you abstract any of the contents of the bottle certainly not then why did you take it up
i once studied to be a doctor such things naturally interest me ah so poisons naturally interest you do they still you waited to be alone before gratifying that interest of yours
that was pure chance if the others had been there i should have done just the same still as it happens the others were not there
no but in fact during the whole afternoon you were only alone for a couple of minutes and it happened
i say it happened to be during those two minutes that you displayed your natural interest in hydro chloride of strychnine monsieur_lawrence stammered pitiably
i i with a satisfied and expressive countenance sir ernest_heavywether observed i have nothing more to ask you mr_john_cavendish
the heads of the many fashionably attired women present were busily laid together and their whispers became so loud that the judge angrily threatened to have the court cleared if there was not immediate silence
this bit of cross examination had caused great excitement in court there was little more evidence the hand writing experts were called upon for their opinion of the signature of mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp in the chemist poison register
they all declared unanimously that it was certainly not his hand writing and gave it as their view that it might be that of the prisoner disguised
sir ernest_heavywether speech in opening the case for the defence was not a long one but it was backed by the full force of his emphatic manner
never he said in the course of his long experience had he known a charge of murder rest on slighter evidence
cross examined they admitted that it might be the prisoner hand writing cleverly counterfeited not only was it entirely circumstantial but the greater part of it was practically unproved
let them take the testimony they had heard and sift it impartially the strychnine had been found in a drawer in the prisoner room
that drawer was an unlocked one as he had pointed out and he submitted that there was no evidence to prove that it was the prisoner who had concealed the poison there
it was in fact a wicked and malicious attempt on the part of some third person to fix the crime on the prisoner
the prosecution had been unable to produce a shred of evidence in support of their contention that it was the prisoner who ordered the black beard from parkson
the quarrel which had taken place between prisoner and his stepmother was freely admitted but both it and his financial embarrassments had been grossly exaggerated
his learned friend sir ernest_heavywether nodded carelessly at mr philips had stated that if the prisoner were an innocent man he would have come forward at the inquest to explain that it was he and not mr mrs_inglethorp who had been the participator in the quarrel
the prisoner returning to the house on tuesday evening had been authoritatively told that there had been a violent quarrel between mr and mrs_inglethorp
he thought the facts had been misrepresented what had actually occurred was this no suspicion had entered the prisoner head that anyone could possibly have mistaken his voice for that of mr mrs_inglethorp
the prosecution averred that on monday july th the prisoner had entered the chemist shop in the village disguised as mr mrs_inglethorp
the prisoner on the contrary was at that time at a lonely spot called marston spinney where he had been summoned by an anonymous note couched in blackmailing terms and threatening to reveal certain matters to his wife unless he complied with its demands
the prisoner had accordingly gone to the appointed spot and after waiting there vainly for half an hour had returned home
unfortunately he had met with no one on the way there or back who could vouch for the truth of his story but luckily he had kept the note and it would be produced as evidence
as for the statement relating to the destruction of the will the prisoner had formerly practiced at the bar and was perfectly well aware that the will made in his favour a year before was automatically revoked by his stepmother remarriage
he would call evidence to show who did destroy the will and it was possible that that might open up quite a new view of the case
he naturally concluded that his stepmother had had two quarrels finally he would point out to the jury that there was evidence against other people besides mr_john_cavendish
he would direct their attention to the fact that the evidence against mr monsieur_lawrence mr_john_cavendish was quite as strong if not stronger than that against his brother
he would now call the prisoner mr_john_cavendish acquitted himself well in the witness box under sir ernest_heavywether skilful handling he told his tale credibly and well
the anonymous note received by him was produced and handed to the jury to examine the readiness with which he admitted his financial difficulties and the disagreement with his stepmother lent value to his denials
at the close of his examination he paused and said i should like to make one thing clear i utterly reject and disapprove of sir ernest_heavywether insinuations against my brother
sir ernest_heavywether merely smiled and noted with a sharp eye that mr_john_cavendish protest had produced a very favourable impression on the jury
my brother i am convinced had no more to do with the crime than i have then the cross examination began
i understand you to say that it never entered your head that the witness at the inquest could possibly have mistaken your voice for that of mr mrs_inglethorp
i was told there had been a quarrel between my mother and mr mrs_inglethorp and it never occurred to me that such was not really the case
is not that very surprising no i dont think so not when the servant mademoiselle_dorcas repeated certain fragments of the conversation fragments which you must have recognized
i did not recognize them your memory must be unusually short no but we were both angry and i think said more than we meant
i paid very little attention to my mother actual words mr philips incredulous sniff was a triumph of forensic skill
he passed on to the subject of the note you have produced this note very opportunely tell me is there nothing familiar about the hand writing of it
not that i know of do you not think that it bears a marked resemblance to your own hand writing carelessly disguised
i put it to you that anxious to prove an alibi you conceived the idea of a fictitious and rather incredible appointment and wrote this note yourself in order to bear out your statement
is it not a fact that at the time you claim to have been waiting about at a solitary and unfrequented spot you were really in the chemist shop in styles st mary_cavendish where you purchased strychnine in the name of mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp
no i do not think so i put it to you that it is your own hand writing no no
i put it to you that wearing a suit of mr mrs_inglethorp clothes with a black beard trimmed to resemble his you were there and signed the register in his name
then i will leave the remarkable similarity of hand writing between the note the register and your own to the consideration of the jury said mr philips and sat down with the air of a man who has done his duty but who was nevertheless horrified by such deliberate perjury
no that is a lie that is absolutely untrue after this as it was growing late the case was adjourned till monday
hercule_poirot i noticed was looking profoundly discouraged he had that little frown between the eyes that i knew so well
what is it hercule_poirot i inquired ah mon ami things are going badly badly in spite of myself my heart gave a leap of relief
evidently there was a likelihood of mr_john_cavendish being acquitted when we reached the house my little friend waved aside mary_cavendish offer of tea
no i thank you madame i will mount to my room i followed him still frowning he went across to the desk and took out a small pack of patience cards
then he drew up a chair to the table and to my utter amazement began solemnly to build card houses my jaw dropped involuntarily and he said at once no mon ami i am not in my second childhood
i steady my nerves that is all this employment requires precision of the fingers with precision of the fingers goes precision of the brain
and never have i needed that more than now what is the trouble i asked with a great thump on the table hercule_poirot demolished his carefully built up edifice
it is this mon ami that i can build card houses seven stories high but i cannot thump find thump that last link of which i spoke to you
i could not quite tell what to say so i held my peace and he began slowly building up the cards again speaking in jerks as he did so
it is done so by placing one card on another with mathematical precision i watched the card house rising under his hand story by story
he never hesitated or faltered it was really almost like a conjuring trick what a steady hand you ve got i remarked
i believe i ve only seen your hand shake once on an occasion when i was enraged without doubt observed hercule_poirot with great placidity
yes indeed you were in a towering rage do you remember it was when you discovered that the lock of the despatch case in mrs_inglethorp bedroom had been forced
you stood by the mantel piece twiddling the things on it in your usual fashion and your hand shook like a leaf
for hercule_poirot uttering a hoarse and inarticulate cry again annihilated his masterpiece of cards and putting his hand over his eyes swayed backwards and forwards apparently suffering the keenest agony
i must say but i stopped suddenly good heavens hercule_poirot i cried what is the matter are you taken ill
no no he gasped it is it is that i have an idea oh i exclaimed much relieved one of your little ideas
ah ma foi no replied hercule_poirot frankly this time it is an idea gigantic stupendous and you you my friend have given it to me
suddenly clasping me in his arms he kissed me warmly on both cheeks and before i had recovered from my surprise ran headlong from the room
mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish entered at that moment what is the matter with monsieur hercule_poirot he rushed past me crying out a garage
for the love of heaven direct me to a garage madame and before i could answer he had dashed out into the street
i hurried to the window true enough there he was tearing down the street hatless and gesticulating as he went
i turned to mary_cavendish with a gesture of despair he ll be stopped by a policeman in another minute there he goes round the corner
our eyes met and we stared helplessly at one another what can be the matter i shook my head
i dont know he was building card houses when suddenly he said he had an idea and rushed off as you saw
well said mary_cavendish i expect he will be back before dinner but night fell and hercule_poirot had not returned
chapter xii the last link hercule_poirot abrupt departure had intrigued us all greatly sunday morning wore away and still he did not reappear
but about three clock a ferocious and prolonged hooting outside drove us to the window to see hercule_poirot alighting from a car accompanied by japp and summerhaye
the little man was transformed he radiated an absurd complacency he bowed with exaggerated respect to mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish madame i have your permission to hold a little réunion in the salon
it is necessary for every one to attend mary_cavendish smiled sadly you know monsieur hercule_poirot that you have carte blanche in every way
you are too amiable madame still beaming hercule_poirot marshalled us all into the drawing room bringing forward chairs as he did so
miss_howard here mademoiselle_cynthia monsieur_lawrence the good mademoiselle_dorcas and annie bien we must delay our proceedings a few minutes until mr mrs_inglethorp arrives
i have sent him a note miss_howard rose immediately from her seat if that man comes into the house i leave it
no no hercule_poirot went up to her and pleaded in a low voice finally miss_howard consented to return to her chair
the company once assembled hercule_poirot rose from his seat with the air of a popular lecturer and bowed politely to his audience
a few minutes later mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp entered the room messieurs mesdames as you all know i was called in by monsieur mr_john_cavendish to investigate this case
i at once examined the bedroom of the deceased which by the advice of the doctors had been kept locked and was consequently exactly as it had been when the tragedy occurred
i found first a fragment of green material second a stain on the carpet near the window still damp thirdly an empty box of bromide powders
to take the fragment of green material first i found it caught in the bolt of the communicating door between that room and the adjoining one occupied by mademoiselle_cynthia
i handed the fragment over to the police who did not consider it of much importance nor did they recognize it for what it was a piece torn from a green land armlet
there was a little stir of excitement now there was only one person at styles who worked on the land mrs
mr_john_cavendish therefore it must have been mrs mr_john_cavendish who entered the deceased room through the door communicating with mademoiselle_cynthia room
but in the first place we have only her word for it since it was she who tried that particular door and reported it fastened
but that door was bolted on the inside i cried when i examined the room yes in the ensuing confusion she would have had ample opportunity to shoot the bolt across
i took an early opportunity of verifying my conjectures to begin with the fragment corresponds exactly with a tear in mrs mr_john_cavendish armlet
also at the inquest mrs mr_john_cavendish declared that she had heard from her own room the fall of the table by the bed
i took an early opportunity of testing that statement by stationing my friend monsieur mr_hastings in the left wing of the building just outside mrs mr_john_cavendish door
i myself in company with the police went to the deceased room and whilst there i apparently accidentally knocked over the table in question but found that as i had expected monsieur mr_hastings had heard no sound at all
this confirmed my belief that mrs mr_john_cavendish was not speaking the truth when she declared that she had been dressing in her room at the time of the tragedy
in fact i was convinced that far from having been in her own room mrs mr_john_cavendish was actually in the deceased room when the alarm was given
i shot a quick glance at mary_cavendish she was very pale but smiling i proceeded to reason on that assumption
mrs mr_john_cavendish is in her mother in law room we will say that she is seeking for something and has not yet found it
suddenly mrs_inglethorp awakens and is seized with an alarming paroxysm she flings out her arm overturning the bed table and then pulls desperately at the bell
mrs mr_john_cavendish startled drops her candle scattering the grease on the carpet she picks it up and retreats quickly to mademoiselle_cynthia room closing the door behind her
she hurries out into the passage for the servants must not find her where she is but it is too late
already footsteps are echoing along the gallery which connects the two wings what can she do quick as thought she hurries back to the young girl room and starts shaking her awake
it occurs to nobody that mrs mr_john_cavendish has not arrived with the rest but and this is significant i can find no one who saw her come from the other wing
the hastily aroused household come trooping down the passage they are all busily battering at mrs_inglethorp door he looked at mary_cavendish mr_john_cavendish
you understand that if i had thought i would do my husband any good by revealing these facts i would have done so
am i right madame she bowed her head quite right monsieur but it did not seem to me to bear upon the question of his guilt or innocence
in a sense that is correct madame but it cleared my mind of many misconceptions and left me free to see other facts in their true significance
the will cried monsieur_lawrence then it was you mary_cavendish who destroyed the will she shook her head and hercule_poirot shook his also
no he said quietly there is only one person who could possibly have destroyed that will mrs_inglethorp herself impossible
i exclaimed she had only made it out that very afternoon nevertheless mon ami it was mrs_inglethorp
because in no other way can you account for the fact that on one of the hottest day of the year mrs_inglethorp ordered a fire to be lighted in her room
i gave a gasp what idiots we had been never to think of that fire as being incongruous hercule_poirot was continuing the temperature on that day messieurs was degrees in the shade
yet mrs_inglethorp ordered a fire why because she wished to destroy something and could think of no other way you will remember that in consequence of the war economics practiced at styles no waste paper was thrown away
the moment i heard of a fire being lighted in mrs_inglethorp room i leaped to the conclusion that it was to destroy some important document possibly a will
there was therefore no means of destroying a thick document such as a will so the discovery of the charred fragment in the grate was no surprise to me
i did not of course know at the time that the will in question had only been made this afternoon and i will admit that when i learnt that fact i fell into a grievous error
i came to the conclusion that mrs_inglethorp determination to destroy her will arose as a direct consequence of the quarrel she had that afternoon and that therefore the quarrel took place after and not before the making of the will
here as we know i was wrong and i was forced to abandon that idea i faced the problem from a new standpoint
now at clock mademoiselle_dorcas overheard her mistress saying angrily you need not think that any fear of publicity or scandal between husband and wife will deter me
i conjectured and conjectured rightly that these words were addressed not to her husband but to mr_john_cavendish at clock an hour later she uses almost the same words but the standpoint is different
she admits to mademoiselle_dorcas i dont know what to do scandal between husband and wife is a dreadful thing at clock she has been angry but completely mistress of herself
at clock she is in violent distress and speaks of having had a great shock looking at the matter psychologically i drew one deduction which i was convinced was correct
at clock mrs_inglethorp quarrels with her son and threatens to denounce him to his wife who by the way overheard the greater part of the conversation
at mrs_inglethorp in consequence of a conversation on the validity of wills makes a will in favour of her husband which the two gardeners witness
at clock mademoiselle_dorcas finds her mistress in a state of considerable agitation with a slip of paper a letter mademoiselle_dorcas thinks in her hand and it is then that she orders the fire in her room to be lighted
presumably then between and clock something has occurred to occasion a complete revolution of feeling since she is now as anxious to destroy the will as she was before to make it
the second scandal she spoke of was not the same as the first and it concerned herself let us reconstruct what was that something
as far as we know she was quite alone during that half hour nobody entered or left that boudoir what then occasioned this sudden change of sentiment
one can only guess but i believe my guess to be correct mrs_inglethorp had no stamps in her desk
we know this because later she asked mademoiselle_dorcas to bring her some now in the opposite corner of the room stood her husband desk locked
she was anxious to find some stamps and according to my theory she tried her own keys in the desk that one of them fitted
she therefore opened the desk and in searching for the stamps she came across something else that slip of paper which mademoiselle_dorcas saw in her hand and which assuredly was never meant for mrs_inglethorp eyes
on the other hand mrs mr_john_cavendish believed that the slip of paper to which her mother in law clung so tenaciously was a written proof of her own husband infidelity
i know she demanded it from mrs_inglethorp who assured her quite truly that it had nothing to do with that matter
now mrs mr_john_cavendish is a very resolute woman and behind her mask of reserve she was madly jealous of her husband
mrs mr_john_cavendish did not believe her she thought that mrs_inglethorp was shielding her stepson she determined to get hold of that paper at all costs and in this resolution chance came to her aid
she happened to pick up the key of mrs_inglethorp despatch case which had been lost that morning she knew that her mother in law invariably kept all important paper in this particular case
mrs mr_john_cavendish therefore made her plans as only a woman driven desperate through jealousy could have done some time in the evening she unbolted the door leading into mademoiselle_cynthia room
she put off her project until the early hours of the morning as being safer since the servants were accustomed to hearing her move about her room at that time
she dressed completely in her land kit and made her way quietly through mademoiselle_cynthia room into that of mrs_inglethorp
possibly she applied oil to the hinges for i found that it opened quite noiselessly when i tried it he paused a moment and mademoiselle_cynthia interrupted
but i should have woken up if anyone had come through my room not if you were drugged mademoiselle_cynthia drugged
mais oui you remember he addressed us collectively again that through all the tumult and noise next door mademoiselle_cynthia slept
that admitted of two possibilities either her sleep was feigned which i did not believe or her unconsciousness was indeed by artificial means
with this latter idea in my mind i examined all the coffee cups most carefully remembering that it was mrs mr_john_cavendish who had brought mademoiselle_cynthia her coffee the night before
i took a sample from each cup and had them analysed with no result i had counted the cups carefully in the event of one having been removed
six persons had taken coffee and six cups were duly found i had to confess myself mistaken then i discovered that i had been guilty of a very grave oversight
coffee had been brought in for seven persons not six for dr_bauerstein had been there that evening this changed the face of the whole affair for there was now one cup missing
the servants noticed nothing since annie the housemaid who took in the coffee brought in seven cups not knowing that mr mrs_inglethorp never drank it whereas mademoiselle_dorcas who cleared them away the following morning found six as usual or strictly speaking she found five the sixth being the one found broken in mrs_inglethorp room
i had an additional reason for that belief in the fact that all the cups found contained sugar which mademoiselle_cynthia never took in her coffee
my attention was attracted by the story of annie about some salt on the tray of cocoa which she took every night to mrs_inglethorp room
i was confident that the missing cup was that of mademoiselle_cynthia i accordingly secured a sample of that cocoa and sent it to be analysed
but that had already been done by dr_bauerstein said monsieur_lawrence quickly not exactly the analyst was asked by him to report whether strychnine was or was not present
he did not have it tested as i did for a narcotic for a narcotic yes here is the analyst report
mrs mr_john_cavendish administered a safe but effectual narcotic to both mrs_inglethorp and mademoiselle_cynthia and it is possible that she had a mauvais quart heure in consequence
she has believed that the sleeping draught she administered was perfectly harmless but there is no doubt that for one terrible moment she must have feared that mrs_inglethorp death lay at her door
she is seized with panic and under its influence she hurries downstairs and quickly drops the coffee cup and saucer used by mademoiselle_cynthia into a large brass vase where it is discovered later by monsieur_lawrence
imagine her feelings when her mother in law is suddenly taken ill and dies and immediately after she hears the word poison the remains of the cocoa she dare not touch
too many eyes are upon her guess at her relief when strychnine is mentioned and she discovers that after all the tragedy is not her doing
we are now able to account for the symptoms of strychnine poisoning being so long in making their appearance a narcotic taken with strychnine will delay the action of the poison for some hours
hercule_poirot paused mary_cavendish looked up at him the colour slowly rising in her face all you have said is quite true monsieur hercule_poirot
it was the most awful hour of my life i shall never forget it but you are wonderful i understand now what i meant when i told you that you could safely confess to papa hercule_poirot eh
but you would not trust me i see everything now said monsieur_lawrence the drugged cocoa taken on top of the poisoned coffee amply accounts for the delay
exactly but was the coffee poisoned or was it not we come to a little difficulty here since mrs_inglethorp never drank it
what the cry of surprise was universal no you will remember my speaking of a stain on the carpet in mrs_inglethorp room
there were some peculiar points about that stain it was still damp it exhaled a strong odour of coffee and imbedded in the nap of the carpet
what had happened was plain to me for not two minutes before i had placed my little case on the table near the window and the table tilting up had deposited it upon the floor on precisely the identical spot
in exactly the same way mrs_inglethorp had laid down her cup of coffee on reaching her room the night before and the treacherous table had played her the same trick
what happened next is mere guess work on my part but i should say that mrs_inglethorp picked up the broken cup and placed it on the table by the bed
feeling in need of a stimulant of some kind she heated up her cocoa and drank it off then and there
i found some little splinters of china now we are faced with a new problem we know the cocoa contained no strychnine
what third medium was there a medium so suitable for disguising the taste of strychnine that it is extraordinary no one has thought of it
the coffee was never drunk yet the strychnine must have been administered between seven and nine clock that evening hercule_poirot looked round the room and then answered himself impressively
her medicine do you mean that the murderer introduced the strychnine into her tonic i cried there was no need to introduce it
to make that clear to you i will read you an extract from a book on dispensing which i found in the dispensary of the red cross hospital at tadminster the following prescription has become famous in text books
it was already there in the mixture the strychnine that killed mrs_inglethorp was the identical strychnine prescribed by dr_wilkins strychninae sulph
gr i potass bromide vi aqua ad
this solution deposits in a few hours the greater part of the strychnine salt as an insoluble bromide in transparent crystals
a lady in england lost her life by taking a similar mixture the precipitated strychnine collected at the bottom and in taking the last dose she swallowed nearly all of it
now there was of course no bromide in dr_wilkins prescription but you will remember that i mentioned an empty box of bromide powders
one or two of those powders introduced into the full bottle of medicine would effectually precipitate the strychnine as the book describes and cause it to be taken in the last dose
you will learn later that the person who usually poured out mrs_inglethorp medicine was always extremely careful not to shake the bottle but to leave the sediment at the bottom of it undisturbed
viii fiat mistura throughout the case there have been evidences that the tragedy was intended to take place on monday evening
mademoiselle_cynthia was spending the night with friend so that mrs_inglethorp would have been quite alone in the right wing completely shut off from help of any kind and would have died in all probability before medical aid could have been summoned
on that day mrs_inglethorp bell wire was neatly cut and on monday evening but in her hurry to be in time for the village entertainment
mrs_inglethorp forgot to take her medicine and the next day she lunched away from home so that the last and fatal dose was actually taken twenty four hours later than had been anticipated by the murderer and it is owing to that delay that the final proof the last link of the chain is now in my hand
amid breathless excitement he held out three thin strips of paper a letter in the murderer own hand writing mes amis
had it been a little clearer in its terms it is possible that mrs_inglethorp warned in time would have escaped
in the deathly silence hercule_poirot pieced together the slips of paper and clearing his throat read dearest evelyn_howard you will be anxious at hearing nothing
as it was she realized her danger but not the manner of it it is all right only it will be to night instead of last night
you understand there a good time coming once the old woman is dead and out of the way no one can possibly bring home the crime to me
that idea of yours about the bromides was a stroke of genius but we must be very circumspect a false step
here my friend the letter breaks off doubtless the writer was interrupted but there can be no question as to his identity
we all know this hand writing and a howl that was almost a scream broke the silence you devil how did you get it
a chair was overturned hercule_poirot skipped nimbly aside a quick movement on his part and his assailant fell with a crash
messieurs mesdames said hercule_poirot with a flourish let me introduce you to the murderer mr mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp chapter xiii
hercule_poirot explains hercule_poirot you old villain i said i ve half a mind to strangle you what do you mean by deceiving me as you have done
we were sitting in the library several hectic day lay behind us in the room below mr_john_cavendish and mary_cavendish were together once more while mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp and miss_howard were in custody
hercule_poirot did not answer me for a moment but at last he said i did not deceive you mon ami
now at last i had hercule_poirot to myself and could relieve my still burning curiosity at most i permitted you to deceive yourself
you see my friend you have a nature so honest and a countenance so transparent that enfin to conceal your feelings is impossible
if i had told you my ideas the very first time you saw mr mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp that astute gentleman would have in your so expressive idiom smelt a rat
yes but why well it is difficult to explain and then bonjour to our chances of catching him i think that i have more diplomacy than you give me credit for
my friend besought hercule_poirot i implore you do not enrage yourself your help has been of the most invaluable it is but the extremely beautiful nature that you have which made me pause
well i grumbled a little mollified i still think you might have given me a hint but i did my friend
several hints you would not take them think now did i ever say to you that i believed mr_john_cavendish guilty
did i not on the contrary tell you that he would almost certainly be acquitted yes but and did i not immediately afterwards speak of the difficulty of bringing the murderer to justice
was it not plain to you that i was speaking of two entirely different persons no i said it was not plain to me
then again continued hercule_poirot at the beginning did i not repeat to you several time that i didnt want mr mrs_inglethorp arrested now
that should have conveyed something to you do you mean to say you suspected him as long ago as that
yes to begin with whoever else might benefit by mrs_inglethorp death her husband would benefit the most there was no getting away from that
when i went up to styles with you that first day i had no idea as to how the crime had been committed but from what i knew of mr mrs_inglethorp
when i arrived at the chateau i realized at once that it was mrs_inglethorp who had burnt the will and there by the way you cannot complain my friend for i tried my best to force on you the significance of that bedroom fire in midsummer
i fancied that it would be very hard to find anything to connect him with it yes yes i said impatiently
there was in fact so much evidence against him that i was inclined to believe that he had not done it
go on well my friend as i say my view as to mr mrs_inglethorp guilt were very much shaken
when i found that the more efforts i made to clear him the more efforts he made to get himself arrested
then when i discovered that mrs_inglethorp had nothing to do with mrs_raikes and that in fact it was mr_john_cavendish who was interested in that quarter i was quite sure
when did you change your mind but why simply this if it had been mrs_inglethorp who was carrying on an intrigue with mrs_raikes his silence was perfectly comprehensible
but when i discovered that it was known all over the village that it was mr_john_cavendish who was attracted by the farmer pretty wife his silence bore quite a different interpretation
this attitude of his gave me furiously to think and i was slowly forced to the conclusion that mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp wanted to be arrested
it was nonsense to pretend that he was afraid of the scandal as no possible scandal could attach to him eh bien
from that moment i was equally determined that he should not be arrested wait a minute i dont see why he wished to be arrested
because mon ami it is the law of your country that a man once acquitted can never be tried again for the same offence
see here he knew that in his position he was bound to be suspected so he conceived the exceedingly clever idea of preparing a lot of manufactured evidence against himself
aha but it was clever his idea assuredly he is a man of method he wished to be arrested he would then produce his irreproachable alibi and hey presto he was safe for life
but i still dont see how he managed to prove his alibi and yet go to the chemist shop hercule_poirot stared at me in surprise
is it possible my poor friend you have not yet realized that it was miss_howard who went to the chemist shop
she is of a good height her voice is deep and manly moreover remember she and mrs_inglethorp are cousins and there is a distinct resemblance between them especially in their gait and bearing
miss_howard but certainly who else it was most easy for her it was simplicity itself they are a clever pair
i am still a little fogged as to how exactly the bromide business was done i remarked bon i will reconstruct for you as far as possible
i am inclined to think that miss_howard was the master mind in that affair you remember her once mentioning that her father was a doctor
possibly she dispensed his medicines for him or she may have taken the idea from one of the many books lying about when mademoiselle_cynthia was studying for her exam
anyway she was familiar with the fact that the addition of a bromide to a mixture containing strychnine would cause the precipitation of the latter
probably the idea came to her quite suddenly mrs_inglethorp had a box of bromide powders which she occasionally took at night
what could be easier than quietly to dissolve one or more of those powders in mrs_inglethorp large sized bottle of medicine when it came from coot
the risk is practically nil the tragedy will not take place until nearly a fortnight later if anyone has seen either of them touching the medicine they will have forgotten it by that time
miss_howard will have engineered her quarrel and departed from the house the lapse of time and her absence will defeat all suspicion
yes it was a clever idea if they had left it alone it is possible the crime might never have been brought home to them
but they were not satisfied they tried to be too clever and that was their undoing hercule_poirot puffed at his tiny cigarette his eyes fixed on the ceiling
they arranged a plan to throw suspicion on mr_john_cavendish by buying strychnine at the village chemist and signing the register in his hand writing
on monday therefore at six clock mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp arranges to be seen by a number of people at a spot far removed from the village
miss_howard has previously made up a cock and bull story about him and mrs_raikes to account for his holding his tongue afterwards
at six clock miss_howard disguised as mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp enters the chemist shop with her story about a dog obtains the strychnine and writes the name of mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp in mr_john_cavendish handwriting which she had previously studied carefully
but as it will never do if mr_john_cavendish too can prove an alibi she writes him an anonymous note still copying his hand writing which takes him to a remote spot where it is exceedingly unlikely that anyone will see him
on monday mrs_inglethorp will take the last dose of her medicine so far all goes well
there is nothing that can compromise him in any way since it is miss_howard who has the strychnine which after all is only wanted as a blind to throw suspicion on mr_john_cavendish
miss_howard goes back to middlingham mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp returns to styles but now a hitch occurs mrs_inglethorp does not take her medicine that night
mrs_inglethorp is out and he sits down to write to his accomplice who he fears may be in a panic at the nonsuccess of their plan
the broken bell mademoiselle_cynthia absence arranged by mrs_inglethorp through his wife all these are wasted and then he makes his slip it is probable that mrs_inglethorp returned earlier than he expected
he fears that if he remains in the room he may have to open it again and that mrs_inglethorp might catch sight of the letter before he could snatch it up
so he goes out and walks in the woods little dreaming that mrs_inglethorp will open his desk and discover the incriminating document
caught in the act and somewhat flurried he hastily shuts and locks his desk but this as we know is what happened
mrs_inglethorp reads it and becomes aware of the perfidy of her husband and evelyn_howard though unfortunately the sentence about the bromides conveys no warning to her mind
she decides to say nothing to her husband but sits down and writes to her solicitor asking him to come on the morrow and she also determines to destroy immediately the will which she has just made
she knows that she is in danger but is ignorant of where the danger lies she keeps the fatal letter it was to discover that letter then that her husband forced the lock of the despatch case
yes and from the enormous risk he ran we can see how fully he realized its importance that letter excepted there was absolutely nothing to connect him with the crime
there only one thing i cant make out why didnt he destroy it at once when he got hold of it
because he did not dare take the biggest risk of all that of keeping it on his own person
i have discovered that there were only five short minutes in which he could have taken it the five minutes immediately before our own arrival on the scene for before that time annie was brushing the stairs and would have seen anyone who passed going to the right wing
i dont understand look at it from his point of view figure to yourself the scene he enters the room unlocking the door by means of one of the other doorkeys they were all much alike
that is a terrible blow to him for it means that his presence in the room cannot be concealed as he had hoped
he hurries to the despatch case it is locked and the keys are nowhere to be seen but he sees clearly that everything must be risked for the sake of that damning piece of evidence
quickly he forces the lock with a penknife and turns over the paper until he finds what he is looking for
but now a fresh dilemma arises he dare not keep that piece of paper on him he may be seen leaving the room he may be searched
if the paper is found on him it is certain doom probably at this minute too he hears the sounds below of mr_wells and mr_john_cavendish leaving the boudoir
he must act quickly where can he hide this terrible slip of paper the contents of the waste paper basket are kept and in any case are sure to be examined
there are no means of destroying it and he dare not keep it he looks round and he sees what do you think mon ami
in a moment he has torn the letter into long thin strips and rolling them up into spills he thrusts them hurriedly in amongst the other spills in the vase on the mantle piece
i shook my head i uttered an exclamation no one would think of looking there hercule_poirot continued
and he will be able at his leisure to come back and destroy this solitary piece of evidence against him
then all the time it was in the spill vase in mrs_inglethorp bedroom under our very noses i cried
hercule_poirot nodded yes my friend that is where i discovered my last link and i owe that very fortunate discovery to you
to me yes do you remember telling me that my hand shook as i was straightening the ornaments on the mantel piece
do you know my friend i remembered that earlier in the morning when we had been there together i had straightened all the objects on the mantel piece
and if they were already straightened there would be no need to straighten them again unless in the meantime someone else had touched them
yes but i dont see no but i saw dear me i murmured so that is the explanation of your extraordinary behaviour
but i still cant understand why mrs_inglethorp was such a fool as to leave it there when he had plenty of opportunity to destroy it
you rushed down to styles and found it still there yes and it was a race for time
ah but he had no opportunity i saw to that you yes do you remember reproving me for taking the household into my confidence on the subject
i was not sure then if mrs_inglethorp was the criminal or not but if he was i reasoned that he would not have the paper on him but would have hidden it somewhere and by enlisting the sympathy of the household i could effectually prevent his destroying it
he was already under suspicion and by making the matter public i secured the services of about ten amateur detectives who would be watching him unceasingly and being himself aware of their watchfulness he would not dare seek further to destroy the document
yes well my friend i saw there was just one chance he was therefore forced to depart from the house leaving it in the spill vase
but surely miss_howard had ample opportunities of aiding him yes but miss_howard did not know of the paper existence
they were supposed to be deadly enemies and until mr_john_cavendish was safely convicted they neither of them dared risk a meeting
of course i had a watch kept on mr mrs_inglethorp hoping that sooner or later he would lead me to the hiding place
in accordance with their prearranged plan she never spoke to mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp but he was too clever to take any chances
the paper was safe where it was since no one had thought of looking there in the first week it was not likely they would do so afterwards
but for your lucky remark we might never have been able to bring him to justice i understand that now but when did you first begin to suspect miss_howard
when i discovered that she had told a lie at the inquest about the letter she had received from mrs_inglethorp
why what was there to lie about you saw that letter do you recall its general appearance yes more or less
you will recollect then that mrs_inglethorp wrote a very distinctive hand and left large clear spaces between her words
but if you look at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that july th is quite different in this respect
you do not see that that letter was not written on the th but on the th the day after miss_howard departure
do you see what i mean no i confessed i dont the was written in before the to turn it into the th
but why that is exactly what i asked myself why does miss_howard suppress the letter written on the th and produce this faked one instead
because she did not wish to show the letter of the th why again and at once a suspicion dawned in my mind
you will remember my saying that it was wise to beware of people who were not telling you the truth
and yet i cried indignantly after that you gave me two reasons why miss_howard could not have committed the crime
for a long time they were a stumbling block to me until i remembered a very significant fact that she and mr_alfred_inglethorp mrs_inglethorp were cousins
she could not have committed the crime single handed but the reasons against that did not debar her from being an accomplice
and very good reasons too replied hercule_poirot and then there was that rather over vehement hatred of hers it concealed a very opposite emotion
they had already arranged their infamous plot that he should marry this rich but rather foolish old lady induce her to make a will leaving her money to him and then gain their ends by a very cleverly conceived crime
if all had gone as they planned they would probably have left england and lived together on their poor victim money
there was undoubtedly a tie of passion between them long before he came to styles they are a very astute and unscrupulous pair
while suspicion was to be directed against him she would be making quiet preparations for a very different dénouement she arrives from middlingham with all the compromising items in her possession
no suspicion attaches to her no notice is paid to her coming and going in the house she hides the strychnine and glasses in mr_john_cavendish room
she puts the beard in the attic she will see to it that sooner or later they are duly discovered i dont quite see why they tried to fix the blame on mr_john_cavendish i remarked
it would have been much easier for them to bring the crime home to monsieur_lawrence yes but that was mere chance
all the evidence against him arose out of pure accident it must in fact have been distinctly annoying to the pair of schemers
his manner was unfortunate i observed thoughtfully yes you realize of course what was at the back of that
no you did not understand that he believed mademoiselle_cynthia guilty of the crime no i exclaimed astonished impossible
not at all i myself nearly had the same idea it was in my mind when i asked mr_wells that first question about the will
then there were the bromide powders which she had made up and her clever male impersonations as mademoiselle_dorcas recounted them to us
shall i tell you what made monsieur_lawrence turn so pale when he first entered his mother room on the fatal night
it was because whilst his mother lay there obviously poisoned he saw over your shoulder that the door into mademoiselle_cynthia room was unbolted
there was really more evidence against her than anyone else you are joking hercule_poirot no but he declared that he saw it bolted
i cried exactly said hercule_poirot dryly and that was just what confirmed my suspicion that it was not
he was shielding mademoiselle_cynthia but why should he shield her because he is in love with her i laughed
there hercule_poirot you are quite wrong i happen to know for a fact that far from being in love with her he positively dislikes her
who told you that mon ami mademoiselle_cynthia herself la pauvre petite and she was concerned she said that she did not mind at all
then she certainly did mind very much remarked hercule_poirot they are like that les femmes what you say about monsieur_lawrence is a great surprise to me i said
but why it was most obvious did not monsieur_lawrence make the sour face every time mademoiselle_cynthia spoke and laughed with his brother
when he entered his mother room and saw her obviously poisoned he jumped to the conclusion that mademoiselle_cynthia knew something about the matter
he had taken it into his long head that mademoiselle_cynthia was in love with monsieur mr_john_cavendish he was nearly driven desperate
first he crushed the coffee cup to powder under his feet remembering that she had gone up with his mother the night before and he determined that there should be no chance of testing its contents
thenceforward he strenuously and quite uselessly upheld the theory of death from natural causes and what about the extra coffee cup
monsieur_lawrence did not know at all what i meant but on reflection he came to the conclusion that if he could find an extra coffee cup anywhere his lady love would be cleared of suspicion
i was fairly certain that it was mrs mr_john_cavendish who had hidden it but i had to make sure and he was perfectly right
one thing more what did mrs_inglethorp mean by her dying words they were of course an accusation against her husband
dear me hercule_poirot i said with a sigh i think you have explained everything i am glad it has all ended so happily
my dear friend do you not realize that it was simply and solely the trial which has brought them together again
even mr_john_cavendish and his wife are reconciled thanks to me how do you mean thanks to you that mr_john_cavendish still loved his wife i was convinced
also that she was equally in love with him but they had drifted very far apart it all arose from a misunderstanding
he is a sensitive man in his way he would not force himself upon her if she did not want him
she married him without love he knew it and as he withdrew her love awoke but they are both unusually proud and their pride held them inexorably apart
he drifted into an entanglement with mrs_raikes and she deliberately cultivated the friendship of dr_bauerstein do you remember the day of mr_john_cavendish arrest when you found me deliberating over a big decision
yes i quite understood your distress pardon me mon ami but you did not understand it in the least i was trying to decide whether or not i would clear mr_john_cavendish at once
they were entirely in the dark as to my real attitude up to the very last moment which partly accounts for my success
i could have cleared him though it might have meant a failure to convict the real criminals do you mean that you could have saved mr_john_cavendish from being brought to trial
yes my friend but i eventually decided in favour of a woman happiness nothing but the great danger through which they have passed could have brought these two proud souls together again
i looked at hercule_poirot in silent amazement the colossal cheek of the little man who on earth but hercule_poirot would have thought of a trial for murder as a restorer of conjugal happiness
i perceive your thoughts mon ami said hercule_poirot smiling at me no one but hercule_poirot would have attempted such a thing
and you are wrong in condemning it the happiness of one man and one woman is the greatest thing in all the world
his words took me back to earlier events i remembered mary_cavendish as she lay white and exhausted on the sofa listening listening
there had come the sound of the bell below she had started up hercule_poirot had opened the door and meeting her agonized eyes had nodded gently
he had stood aside and as i went out i had seen the look in mary_cavendish eyes as mr_john_cavendish had caught his wife in his arms
yes madame he said i have brought him back to you perhaps you are right hercule_poirot i said gently
yes it is the greatest thing in the world suddenly there was a tap at the door and mademoiselle_cynthia peeped in
i i only come in i said springing up she came in but did not sit down i only wanted to tell you something
yes mademoiselle_cynthia fidgeted with a little tassel for some moments then suddenly exclaiming you dears kissed first me and then hercule_poirot and rushed out of the room again
what on earth does this mean i asked surprised it was very nice to be kissed by mademoiselle_cynthia but the publicity of the salute rather impaired the pleasure
it means that she has discovered monsieur_lawrence does not dislike her as much as she thought replied hercule_poirot philosophically
but here he is monsieur_lawrence at that moment passed the door eh monsieur_lawrence called hercule_poirot
we must congratulate you is it not so monsieur_lawrence blushed and then smiled awkwardly a man in love is a sorry spectacle
now mademoiselle_cynthia had looked charming i sighed what is it mon ami nothing i said sadly they are two delightful women
and neither of them is for you finished hercule_poirot never mind console yourself my friend we may hunt together again who knows
