i my father family name being pirrip and my christian name philip my infant tongue could make of both name nothing longer or more explicit than mr_pip
so i called myself mr_pip and came to be called mr_pip i give pirrip as my father family name on the authority of his tombstone and my sister mrs
as i never saw my father or my mother and never saw any likeness of either of them for their day were long before the day of photographs my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones
the shape of the letters on my father gave me an odd idea that he was a square stout dark man with curly black hair
from the character and turn of the inscription also miss_georgiana wife of the above i drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly
to five little stone lozenges each about a foot and a half long which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine who gave up trying to get a living exceedingly early in that universal struggle i am indebted for a belief i religiously entertained that they had all been born on their back with their hand in their trousers pocket and had never taken them out in this state of existence
mrs_joe_gargery who married the blacksmith ours was the marsh country down by the river within as the river wound twenty miles of the sea
my first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of thing seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening
at such a time i found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard and that philip pirrip late of this parish and also miss_georgiana wife of the above were dead and buried and that alexander bartholomew abraham tobias and roger infant child of the aforesaid were also dead and buried and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard intersected with dikes and mounds and gate with scattered cattle feeding on it was the marsh and that the low leaden line beyond was the river and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry was mr_pip
hold your noise cried a terrible voice as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch
keep still you little devil or i ll cut your throat a fearful man all in coarse gray with a great iron on his leg
a man who had been soaked in water and smothered in mud and lamed by stones and cut by flints and stung by nettles and torn by briars who limped and shivered and glared and growled and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin
a man with no hat and with broken shoes and with an old rag tied round his head oh dont cut my throat sir i pleaded in terror
pray dont do it sir tell us your name said the man quick mr_pip sir once more said the man staring at me
give it mouth mr_pip pip sir show us where you live said the man pint out the place
i pointed to where our village lay on the flat in shore among the alder trees and pollards a mile or more from the church
the man after looking at me for a moment turned me upside down and emptied my pocket there was nothing in them but a piece of bread
he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me and i saw the steeple under my foot when the church came to itself
when the church came to itself for i say i was seated on a high tombstone trembling while he ate the bread ravenously
you young dog said the man licking his lips what fat cheeks you ha got i believe they were fat though i was at that time undersized for my year and not strong
darn me if i couldnt eat em said the man with a threatening shake of his head and if i hant half a mind tot
i earnestly expressed my hope that he wouldnt and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me partly to keep myself upon it partly to keep myself from crying
now lookee here said the man where your mother there sir said i he started made a short run and stopped and looked over his shoulder
there sir i timidly explained also miss_georgiana that my mother oh said he coming back and is that your father alonger your mother
yes sir said i him too late of this parish ha he muttered then considering who ye live with supposin you re kindly let to live which i hant made up my mind about
my sister sir mrs_joe_gargery wife of mrs_joe_gargery the blacksmith sir blacksmith eh said he and looked down at his leg
after darkly looking at his leg and me several time he came closer to my tombstone took me by both arm and tilted me back as far as he could hold me so that his eye looked most powerfully down into mine and mine looked most helplessly up into his
now lookee here he said the question being whether you re to be let to live you know what a file is
after each question he tilted me over a little more so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger
yes sir and you know what wittles is yes sir you get me a file he tilted me again
and you get me wittles he tilted me again you bring em both to me he tilted me again
i was dreadfully frightened and so giddy that i clung to him with both hand and said if you would kindly please to let me keep upright sir perhaps i shouldnt be sick and perhaps i could attend more
or i ll have your heart and liver out he tilted me again he gave me a most tremendous dip and roll so that the church jumped over its own weathercock
then he held me by the arm in an upright position on the top of the stone and went on in these fearful terms
you bring me to morrow morning early that file and them wittles you bring the lot to me at that old battery over yonder
you do it and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me or any person sumever and you shall be let to live
you fail or you go from my word in any partickler no matter how small it is and your heart and your liver shall be tore out roasted and ate
now i aint alone as you may think i am there a young man hid with me in comparison with which young man i am a angel
that young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself of getting at a boy and at his heart and at his liver
that young man hears the word i speak it is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man
a boy may lock his door may be warm in bed may tuck himself up may draw the clothes over his head may think himself comfortable and safe but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open
i am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment with great difficulty i find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside
i said that i would get him the file and i would get him what broken bits of food i could and i would come to him at the battery early in the morning
now what do you say say lord strike you dead if you dont said the man i said so and he took me down
now he pursued you remember what you ve undertook and you remember that young man and you get home goo good night sir i faltered
much of that said he glancing about him over the cold wet flat i wish i was a frog
at the same time he hugged his shuddering body in both his arm clasping himself as if to hold himself together and limped towards the low church wall
as i saw him go picking his way among the nettles and among the brambles that bound the green mounds he looked in my young eye as if he were eluding the hand of the dead people stretching up cautiously out of their graves to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in
when he came to the low church wall he got over it like a man whose leg were numbed and stiff and then turned round to look for me
or a eel when i saw him turning i set my face towards home and made the best use of my leg
but presently i looked over my shoulder and saw him going on again towards the river still hugging himself in both arm and picking his way with his sore foot among the great stones dropped into the marsh here and there for stepping place when the rains were heavy or the tide was in
the marsh were just a long black horizontal line then as i stopped to look after him and the river was just another horizontal line not nearly so broad nor yet so black and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed
on the edge of the river i could faintly make out the only two black thing in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered like an unhooped cask upon a pole an ugly thing when you were near it the other a gibbet with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate
the man was limping on towards this latter as if he were the pirate come to life and come down and going back to hook himself up again
it gave me a terrible turn when i thought so and as i saw the cattle lifting their head to gaze after him i wondered whether they thought so too
i looked all round for the horrible young man and could see no signs of him but now i was frightened again and ran home without stopping
my sister mrs_joe_gargery was more than twenty year older than i and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because she had brought me up by hand
having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me i supposed that mrs_joe_gargery and i were both brought up by hand
she was not a good looking woman my sister and i had a general impression that she must have made mrs_joe_gargery marry her by hand
mrs_joe_gargery was a fair man with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face and with eye of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites
chapter ii he was a mild good natured sweet tempered easy going foolish dear fellow a sort of hercules in strength and also in weakness
my sister mrs_joe_gargery with black hair and eye had such a prevailing redness of skin that i sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg grater instead of soap
she was tall and bony and almost always wore a coarse apron fastened over her figure behind with two loops and having a square impregnable bib in front that was stuck full of pins and needles
she made it a powerful merit in herself and a strong reproach against mrs_joe_gargery that she wore this apron so much
though i really see no reason why she should have worn it at all or why if she did wear it at all she should not have taken it off every day of her life
mrs_joe_gargery forge adjoined our house which was a wooden house as many of the dwellings in our country were most of them at that time
mrs_joe_gargery and i being fellow sufferers and having confidences as such mrs_joe_gargery imparted a confidence to me the moment i raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it sitting in the chimney corner
when i ran home from the churchyard the forge was shut up and mrs_joe_gargery was sitting alone in the kitchen
mrs_joe_gargery has been out a dozen time looking for you mr_pip and she out now making it a baker dozen
at this dismal intelligence i twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round and looked in great depression at the fire
is she yes mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery and what worse she got tickler with her tickler was a wax ended piece of cane worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame
she sot down said mrs_joe_gargery and she got up and she made a grab at tickler and she ram paged out
that what she did said mrs_joe_gargery slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker and looking at it she ram paged out mr_pip
has she been gone long mrs_joe_gargery i always treated him as a larger species of child and as no more than my equal
well said mrs_joe_gargery glancing up at the dutch clock she been on the ram page this last spell about five minutes mr_pip
she a coming get behind the door old chap and have the jack towel betwixt you i took the advice
my sister mrs_joe_gargery throwing the door wide open and finding an obstruction behind it immediately divined the cause and applied tickler to its further investigation
she concluded by throwing me i often served as a connubial missile at mrs_joe_gargery who glad to get hold of me on any terms passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg
tell me directly what you ve been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit or i have you out of that corner if you was fifty pips and he was five hundred gargerys
where have you been you young monkey said mrs_joe_gargery stamping her foot i have only been to the churchyard said i from my stool crying and rubbing myself
churchyard repeated my sister if it warnt for me you have been to the churchyard long ago and stayed there
who brought you up by hand you did said i and why did i do it i should like to know
exclaimed my sister i whimpered i dont know i dont said my sister i never do it again
i know that i may truly say i ve never had this apron of mine off since born you were it bad enough to be a blacksmith wife and him a mrs_joe_gargery without being your mother
for the fugitive out on the marsh with the ironed leg the mysterious young man the file the food and the dreadful pledge
my thought strayed from that question as i looked disconsolately at the fire i was under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises rose before me in the avenging coals
hah said mrs_joe_gargery restoring tickler to his station churchyard indeed you may well say churchyard you two
you ll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you one of these day and a pr recious pair you be without me
as she applied herself to set the tea thing mrs_joe_gargery peeped down at me over his leg as if he were mentally casting me and himself up and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make under the grievous circumstance foreshadowed
after that he sat feeling his right side flaxen curls and whisker and following mrs_joe_gargery about with his blue eye as his manner always was at squally time
one of us by the by had not said it at all my sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us that never varied
first with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib where it sometimes got a pin into it and sometimes a needle which we afterwards got into our mouths
then she took some butter not too much on a knife and spread it on the loaf in an apothecary kind of way as if she were making a plaster using both side of the knife with a slapping dexterity and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust
then she gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf which she finally before separating from the loaf hewed into two halves of which mrs_joe_gargery got one and i the other
i felt that i must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance and his ally the still more dreadful young man
i knew mrs_joe_gargery housekeeping to be of the strictest kind and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe
on the present occasion though i was hungry i dared not eat my slice therefore i resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my trousers
it was as if i had to make up my mind to leap from the top of a high house or plunge into a great depth of water
the effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose i found to be quite awful and it was made the more difficult by the unconscious mrs_joe_gargery
in our already mentioned freemasonry as fellow sufferers and in his good natured companionship with me it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit through our slices by silently holding them up to each other admiration now and then which stimulated us to new exertions
to night mrs_joe_gargery several time invited me by the display of his fast diminishing slice to enter upon our usual friendly competition but he found me each time with my yellow mug of tea on one knee and my untouched bread and butter on the other
at last i desperately considered that the thing i contemplated must be done and that it had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the circumstance
i took advantage of a moment when mrs_joe_gargery had just looked at me and got my bread and butter down my leg
mrs_joe_gargery was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice which he didnt seem to enjoy
he turned it about in his mouth much longer than usual pondering over it a good deal and after all gulped it down like a pill
he was about to take another bite and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it when his eye fell on me and he saw that my bread and butter was gone
the wonder and consternation with which mrs_joe_gargery stopped on the threshold of his bite and stared at me were too evident to escape my sister observation
what the matter now said she smartly as she put down her cup i say you know muttered mrs_joe_gargery shaking his head at me in very serious remonstrance
mr_pip old chap you ll do yourself a mischief it ll stick somewhere you cant have chawed it mr_pip what the matter now
repeated my sister more sharply than before if you can cough any trifle on it up mr_pip i recommend you to do it said mrs_joe_gargery all aghast
by this time my sister was quite desperate so she pounced on mrs_joe_gargery and taking him by the two whiskers knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him while i sat in the corner looking guiltily on
manner is manner but still your elth your elth now perhaps you ll mention what the matter said my sister out of breath you staring great stuck pig
you know mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery solemnly with his last bite in his cheek and speaking in a confidential voice as if we two were quite alone you and me is always friend and i be the last to tell upon you any time
but such a he moved his chair and looked about the floor between us and then again at me such a most oncommon bolt as that
mrs_joe_gargery looked at her in a helpless way then took a helpless bite and looked at me again been bolting his food has he cried my sister
you know old chap said mrs_joe_gargery looking at me and not at mrs_joe_gargery with his bite still in his cheek
i bolted myself when i was your age frequent and as a boy i ve been among a many bolters but i never see your bolting equal yet mr_pip and it a mercy you aint bolted dead
my sister made a dive at me and fished me up by the hair saying nothing more than the awful word you come along and be dosed
some medical beast had revived tar water in those day as a fine medicine and mrs_joe_gargery always kept a supply of it in the cupboard having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness
at the best of time so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative that i was conscious of going about smelling like a new fence
on this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture which was poured down my throat for my greater comfort while mrs_joe_gargery held my head under her arm as a boot would be held in a bootjack
mrs_joe_gargery got off with half a pint but was made to swallow that much to his disturbance as he sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire because he had had a turn
judging from myself i should say he certainly had a turn afterwards if he had had none before
conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy but when in the case of a boy that secret burden co operates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers it is as i can testify a great punishment
for i never thought of any of the housekeeping property as his united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as i sat or when i was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand almost drove me out of my mind
then as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare i thought i heard the voice outside of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to secrecy declaring that he couldnt and wouldnt starve until to morrow but must be fed now
at other time i thought what if the young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hand in me should yield to a constitutional impatience or should mistake the time and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to night instead of to morrow
the guilty knowledge that i was going to rob mrs_joe_gargery i never thought i was going to rob mrs_joe_gargery if ever anybody hair stood on end with terror mine must have done so then
it was christmas eve and i had to stir the pudding for next day with a copper stick from seven to eight by the dutch clock
i tried it with the load upon my leg and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on his leg and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle quite unmanageable
but perhaps nobody ever did happily i slipped away and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom
said i when i had done my stirring and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed was that great guns mrs_joe_gargery
hark ah said mrs_joe_gargery there another conwict off what does that mean mrs_joe_gargery said i mrs_joe_gargery who always took explanations upon herself said snappishly escaped
while mrs_joe_gargery sat with her head bending over her needlework i put my mouth into the forms of saying to mrs_joe_gargery
mrs_joe_gargery put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer that i could make out nothing of it
escaped administering the definition like tar water what a convict but the single word mr_pip there was a conwict off last night said mrs_joe_gargery aloud after sunset gun
who firing said i drat that boy interposed my sister frowning at me over her work what a questioner he is
and they fired warning of him and now it appears they re firing warning of another ask no question and you ll be told no lies
it was not very polite to herself i thought to imply that i should be told lies by her even if i did ask question
at this point mrs_joe_gargery greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like sulks
but she never was polite unless there was company therefore i naturally pointed to mrs_joe_gargery and put my mouth into the form of saying her
but mrs_joe_gargery wouldnt hear of that at all and again opened his mouth very wide and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it
mrs_joe_gargery said i as a last resort i should like to know if you wouldnt much mind where the firing comes from
but i could make nothing of the word lord bless the boy exclaimed my sister as if she didnt quite mean that but rather the contrary
from the hulks oh said i looking at mrs_joe_gargery hulks mrs_joe_gargery gave a reproachful cough as much as to say well i told you so
and please what hulks said i that the way with this boy exclaimed my sister pointing me out with her needle and thread and shaking her head at me
answer him one question and he ll ask you a dozen directly hulks are prison ships right cross th meshes we always used that name for marsh in our country
i wonder who put into prison ships and why they re put there said i in a general way and with quiet desperation
it was too much for mrs_joe_gargery who immediately rose i tell you what young fellow said she i didnt bring you up by hand to badger people life out
people are put in the hulks because they murder and because they rob and forge and do all sorts of bad and they always begin by asking question
i was never allowed a candle to light me to bed and as i went upstairs in the dark with my head tingling from mrs_joe_gargery thimble having played the tambourine upon it to accompany her last word i felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were handy for me
it would be blame to me and not praise if i had now you get along to bed i was clearly on my way there
since that time which is far enough away now i have often thought that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror
i had begun by asking question and i was going to rob mrs_joe_gargery no matter how unreasonable the terror so that it be terror
i was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver i was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg i was in mortal terror of myself from whom an awful promise had been extracted i had no hope of deliverance through my all powerful sister who repulsed me at every turn i am afraid to think of what i might have done on requirement in the secrecy of my terror
if i slept at all that night it was only to imagine myself drifting down the river on a strong spring tide to the hulks a ghostly pirate calling out to me through a speaking trumpet as i passed the gibbet station that i had better come ashore and be hanged there at once and not put it off
i was afraid to sleep even if i had been inclined for i knew that at the first faint dawn of morning i must rob the pantry
to have got one i must have struck it out of flint and steel and have made a noise like the very pirate himself rattling his chains
as soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with gray i got up and went downstairs
every board upon the way and every crack in every board calling after me stop thief and get up mrs_joe_gargery
in the pantry which was far more abundantly supplied than usual owing to the season i was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels whom i rather thought i caught when my back was half turned winking
i had no time for verification no time for selection no time for anything for i had no time to spare
i stole some bread some rind of cheese about half a jar of mincemeat which i tied up in my pocket handkerchief with my last night slice some brandy from a stone bottle which i decanted into a glass bottle i had secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid spanish liquorice water up in my room diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard a meat bone with very little on it and a beautiful round compact pork pie
i was nearly going away without the pie but i was tempted to mount upon a shelf to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthenware dish in a corner and i found it was the pie and i took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use and would not be missed for some time
there was a door in the kitchen communicating with the forge i unlocked and unbolted that door and got a file from among mrs_joe_gargery tools
then i put the fastenings as i had found them opened the door at which i had entered when i ran home last night shut it and ran for the misty marsh
there was no doing it in the night for there was no getting a light by easy friction then chapter iii
i had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window as if some goblin had been crying there all night and using the window for a pocket handkerchief
now i saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass like a coarser sort of spiders webs hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade
on every rail and gate wet lay clammy and the marsh mist was so thick that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village a direction which they never accepted for they never came there was invisible to me until i was quite close under it
then as i looked up at it while it dripped it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the hulks
the mist was heavier yet when i got out upon the marsh so that instead of my running at everything everything seemed to run at me
the gate and dikes and banks came bursting at me through the mist as if they cried as plainly as could be a boy with somebody else pork pie
the cattle came upon me with like suddenness staring out of their eye and steaming out of their nostrils halloa young thief
one black ox with a white cravat on who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air fixed me so obstinately with his eye and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as i moved round that i blubbered out to him i couldnt help it sir
it was a rimy morning and very damp this was very disagreeable to a guilty mind stop him it wasnt for myself
upon which he put down his head blew a cloud of smoke out of his nose and vanished with a kick up of his hind leg and a flourish of his tail
i couldnt warm my foot to which the damp cold seemed riveted as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man i was running to meet
i knew my way to the battery pretty straight for i had been down there on a sunday with mrs_joe_gargery and
mrs_joe_gargery sitting on an old gun had told me that when i was prentice to him regularly bound we would have such larks there
however in the confusion of the mist i found myself at last too far to the right and consequently had to try back along the river side on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out
making my way along here with all despatch i had just crossed a ditch which i knew to be very near the battery and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch when i saw the man sitting before me
i took it all this time i was getting on towards the river but however fast i went his back was towards me and he had his arm folded and was nodding forward heavy with sleep
i thought he would be more glad if i came upon him with his breakfast in that unexpected manner so i went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder
and yet this man was dressed in coarse gray too and had a great iron on his leg and was lame and hoarse and cold and was everything that the other man was except that he had not the same face and had a flat broad brimmed low crowned felt hat on
all this i saw in a moment for i had only a moment to see it in he swore an oath at me made a hit at me it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself down for it made him stumble and
he instantly jumped up and it was not the same man but another man then he ran into the mist stumbling twice as he went and i lost him
it the young man i thought feeling my heart shoot as i identified him i dare say i should have felt a pain in my liver too if i had known where it was
i was soon at the battery after that and there was the right man hugging himself and limping to and fro as if he had never all night left off hugging and limping waiting for me
he was awfully cold to be sure i half expected to see him drop down before my face and die of deadly cold
his eye looked so awfully hungry too that when i handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass it occurred to me he would have tried to eat it if he had not seen my bundle
he did not turn me upside down this time to get at what i had but left me right side upwards while i opened the bundle and emptied my pocket
brandy said i he was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious manner more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry than a man who was eating
he shivered all the while so violently that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth without biting it off
what in the bottle boy said he it but he left off to take some of the liquor
i think you have got the ague said i i much of your opinion boy said he it bad about here i told him
you ve been lying out on the meshes and they re dreadful aguish rheumatic too i ll eat my breakfast afore they re the death of me said he
i do that if i was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there directly afterwards
he was gobbling mincemeat meatbone bread cheese and pork pie all at once staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round us and often stopping even stopping his jaws to listen
some real or fancied sound some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the marsh now gave him a start and he said suddenly
i ll beat the shivers so far i ll bet you you re not a deceiving imp you brought no one with you
no sir no nor giv no one the office to follow you no well said he i believe you
you be but a fierce young hound indeed if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is
something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock and was going to strike and he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eye
pitying his desolation and watching him as he gradually settled down upon the pie i made bold to say i am glad you enjoy it
i had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food and i now noticed a decided similarity between the dog way of eating and the man
did you speak i said i was glad you enjoyed it thankee my boy i do the man took strong sharp sudden bites just like the dog
he swallowed or rather snapped up every mouthful too soon and too fast and he looked sideways here and there while he ate as if he thought there was danger in every direction of somebody coming to take the pie away
he was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it to appreciate it comfortably i thought or to have anybody to dine with him without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor
i am afraid you wont leave any of it for him said i timidly after a silence during which i had hesitated as to the politeness of making the remark
in all of which particulars he was very like the dog there no more to be got where that came from
it was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint leave any for him who him said my friend stopping in his crunching of pie crust
the young man that you spoke of that was hid with you oh ah he returned with something like a gruff laugh
i thought he looked as if he did said i the man stopped eating and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the greatest surprise
him yes yes he dont want no wittles looked when just now where yonder said i pointing over there where i found him nodding asleep and thought it was you
he held me by the collar and stared at me so that i began to think his first idea about cutting my throat had revived
dressed like you you know only with a hat i explained trembling and and i was very anxious to put this delicately and with the same reason for wanting to borrow a file
i wonder you shouldnt have been sure of that i returned for we heard it up at home and that farther away and we were shut in besides
didnt you hear the cannon last night then there was firing he said to himself
when a man alone on these flats with a light head and a light stomach perishing of cold and want he hears nothin all night but guns firing and voice calling
why see now said he hears he sees the soldiers with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore closing in round him
hears his number called hears himself challenged hears the rattle of the muskets hears the orders make ready present cover him steady man
why if i see one pursuing party last night coming up in order damn em with their tramp tramp i see a hundred
why i see the mist shake with the cannon arter it was broad day but this man he had said all the rest as if he had forgotten my being there did you notice anything in him
and is laid hand on and there nothin and as to firing he had a badly bruised face said i recalling what i hardly knew i knew
not here exclaimed the man striking his left cheek mercilessly with the flat of his hand yes there where is he
he crammed what little food was left into the breast of his gray jacket show me the way he went i ll pull him down like a bloodhound
i indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man and he looked up at it for an instant
but he was down on the rank wet grass filing at his iron like a madman and not minding me or minding his own leg which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody but which he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file
i was very much afraid of him again now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry and i was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer
i told him i must go but he took no notice so i thought the best thing i could do was to slip off
the last i saw of him his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg
curse this iron on my sore leg give us hold of the file boy the last i heard of him i stopped in the mist to listen and the file was still going
chapter iv i fully expected to find a constable in the kitchen waiting to take me up but not only was there no constable there but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery
mrs_joe_gargery was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day and mrs_joe_gargery had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust pan an article into which his destiny always led him sooner or later when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment
and where the deuce ha you been was mrs_joe_gargery christmas salutation when i and my conscience showed ourselves
i said i had been down to hear the carols ah well observed mrs_joe_gargery you might ha done worse
perhaps if i warnt a blacksmith wife and what the same thing a slave with her apron never off i should have been to hear the carols said mrs_joe_gargery
not a doubt of that i thought i rather partial to carols myself and that the best of reason for my never hearing any
mrs_joe_gargery who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air when mrs_joe_gargery darted a look at him and when her eye were withdrawn secretly crossed his two forefingers and exhibited them to me as our token that mrs_joe_gargery was in a cross temper
this was so much her normal state that mrs_joe_gargery and i would often for weeks together be as to our finger like monumental crusaders as to their leg
we were to have a superb dinner consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens and a pair of roast stuffed fowls
a handsome mince pie had been made yesterday morning which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed and the pudding was already on the boil
these extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast for i aint said mrs_joe_gargery i aint a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now with what i ve got before me i promise you
so we had our slices served out as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home and we took gulps of milk and water with apologetic countenances from a jug on the dresser
in the meantime mrs_joe_gargery put clean white curtains up and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one and uncovered the little state parlor across the passage which was never uncovered at any other time but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantel shelf each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth and each the counterpart of the other
mrs_joe_gargery was a very clean housekeeper but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself
my sister having so much to do was going to church vicariously that is to say mrs_joe_gargery and i were going
in his working clothes mrs_joe_gargery was a well knit characteristic looking blacksmith in his holiday clothes he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstance than anything else
nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him and everything that he wore then grazed him
on the present festive occasion he emerged from his room when the blithe bells were going the picture of misery in a full suit of sunday penitentials
as to me i think my sister must have had some general idea that i was a young offender whom an accoucheur policeman had taken up on my birthday and delivered over to her to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law
i was always treated as if i had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason religion and morality and against the dissuading arguments of my best friend
even when i was taken to have a new suit of clothes the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of reformatory and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs
cleanliness is next to godliness and some people do the same by their religion mrs_joe_gargery and i going to church therefore must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate mind
the terrors that had assailed me whenever mrs_joe_gargery had gone near the pantry or out of the room were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hand had done
under the weight of my wicked secret i pondered whether the church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man if i divulged to that establishment
i conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said ye are now to declare it would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry
i am far from being sure that i might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure but for its being christmas day and no sunday
mr_wopsle the clerk at church was to dine with us and mr hubble the wheelwright and mrs_hubble and uncle mr_pumblechook mrs_joe_gargery uncle but mrs_joe_gargery appropriated him who was a well to do cornchandler in the nearest town and drove his own chaise cart
when mrs_joe_gargery and i got home we found the table laid and mrs_joe_gargery dressed and the dinner dressing and the front door unlocked it never was at any other time for the company to enter by and everything most splendid
yet what i suffered outside was nothing to what i underwent within the dinner hour was half past one and still not a word of the robbery
mr_wopsle united to a roman nose and a large shining bald forehead had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him his head he would read the clergyman into fits he himself confessed that if the church was thrown open meaning to competition he would not despair of making his mark in it
the time came without bringing with it any relief to my feelings and the company came the church not being thrown open he was as i have said our clerk
verse he looked all round the congregation first as much as to say you have heard my friend overhead oblige me with your opinion of this style
but he punished the amens tremendously and when he gave out the psalm always giving the whole i opened the door to the company making believe that it was a habit of ours to open that
door and i opened it first to mr_wopsle next to mr and mrs_hubble and last of all to uncle mr_pumblechook
mrs_joe_gargery said uncle mr_pumblechook a large hard breathing middle aged slow man with a mouth like a fish dull staring eye and sandy hair standing upright on his head so that he looked as if he had just been all but choked and had that moment come to i have brought you as the compliments of the season
n i was not allowed to call him uncle under the severest penalties i have brought you mum a bottle of sherry wine and i have brought you mum a bottle of port wine
every christmas day he presented himself as a profound novelty with exactly the same word and carrying the two bottles like dumb bells
every christmas day mrs_joe_gargery replied as she now replied un cle pum ble chook this is kind every christmas day he retorted as he now retorted it no more than your merits
we dined on these occasion in the kitchen and adjourned for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlor which was a change very like mrs_joe_gargery change from his working clothes to his sunday dress
my sister was uncommonly lively on the present occasion and indeed was generally more gracious in the society of mrs_hubble than in other company
i remember mrs_hubble as a little curly sharp edged person in sky blue who held a conventionally juvenile position because she had married mr hubble i dont know at what remote
and now are you all bobbish and how sixpennorth of halfpence meaning me period when she was much younger than he
i remember mr hubble as a tough high shouldered stooping old man of a sawdusty fragrance with his leg extraordinarily wide apart so that in my short day i always saw some miles of open country between them when i met him coming up the lane
not because i was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth with the table in my chest and the pumblechookian elbow in my eye nor because i was not allowed to speak i didnt want to speak nor because i was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls and with those obscure corner of pork of which the pig when living had had the least reason to be vain
among this good company i should have felt myself even if i hadnt robbed the pantry in a false position no i should not have minded that if they would only have left me alone
they seemed to think the opportunity lost if they failed to point the conversation at me every now and then and stick the point into me
i might have been an unfortunate little bull in a spanish arena i got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads
mr_wopsle said grace with theatrical declamation as it now appears to me something like a religious cross of the ghost in hamlet with richard the third and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful
but they wouldnt leave me alone it began the moment we sat down to dinner upon which my sister fixed me with her eye and said in a low reproachful voice do you hear that
mrs_hubble shook her head and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that i should come to no good asked why is it that the young are never grateful
be grateful especially said mr_pumblechook be grateful boy to them which brought you up by hand this moral mystery seemed too much for the company until mr hubble tersely solved it by saying naterally wicious
everybody then murmured true and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner mrs_joe_gargery station and influence were something feebler if possible when there was company than when there was none
but he always aided and comforted me when he could in some way of his own and he always did so at dinner time by giving me gravy if there were any
a little later on in the dinner mr_wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity and intimated in the usual hypothetical case of the church being thrown open what kind of sermon he would have given them
after favoring them with some head of that discourse he remarked that he considered the subject of the day homily ill chosen which was the less excusable he added when there were so many subject going about
there being plenty of gravy to day mrs_joe_gargery spooned into my plate at this point about half a pint true again said uncle mr_pumblechook
you ve hit it sir plenty of subject going about for them that know how to put salt upon their tails
that what wanted a man neednt go far to find a subject if he ready with his salt box mr_pumblechook added after a short interval of reflection look at pork alone
there a subject if you want a subject look at pork true sir many a moral for the young returned mr_wopsle and
i knew he was going to lug me in before he said it might be deduced from that text you listen to this said my sister to me in a severe parenthesis
swine pursued mr_wopsle in his deepest voice and pointing his fork at my blushes as if he were mentioning my christian name swine were the companions of the prodigal
mrs_joe_gargery gave me some more gravy the gluttony of swine is put before us as an example to the young
i thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy
what is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy or girl suggested mr hubble of course or girl mr hubble assented mr_wopsle rather irritably but there is no girl present
besides said mr_pumblechook turning sharp on me think what you ve got to be grateful for if you been born a squeaker he was if ever a child was said my sister most emphatically
mrs_joe_gargery gave me some more gravy well but i mean a four footed squeaker said mr_pumblechook if you had been born such would you have been here now
but i dont mean in that form sir returned mr_pumblechook who had an objection to being interrupted i mean enjoying himself with his elders and betters and improving himself with their conversation and rolling in the lap of luxury
not you unless in that form said mr_wopsle nodding towards the dish would he have been doing that
you would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article and dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw and he would have whipped you under his left arm and with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat pocket and he would have shed your blood and had your life
no he wouldnt and what would have been your destination turning on me again no bringing up by hand then
not a bit of it mrs_joe_gargery offered me more gravy which i was afraid to take he was a world of trouble to you ma am said mrs_hubble commiserating my sister
echoed my sister trouble and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses i had been guilty of and all the acts of sleeplessness i had committed and all the high place i had tumbled from and all the low place i had tumbled into and all the injuries i had done myself and
trouble all the time she had wished me in my grave and i had contumaciously refused to go there i think the romans must have aggravated one another very much with their noses
anyhow mr_wopsle roman nose so aggravated me during the recital of my misdemeanours that i should have liked to pull it until he howled
but all i had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister recital and in which pause everybody had looked at me as i felt painfully conscious with indignation and abhorrence
yet said mr_pumblechook leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed pork regarded as biled is rich too aint it
perhaps they became the restless people they were in consequence have a little brandy uncle said my sister heavens it had come at last
he would find it was weak he would say it was weak and i was lost i held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth with both hand and awaited my fate
my sister went for the stone bottle came back with the stone bottle and poured his brandy out no one else taking any
the wretched man trifled with his glass took it up looked at it through the light put it down prolonged my misery all this time mrs_joe_gargery and mrs_joe_gargery were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding
always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hand and foot i saw the miserable creature finger his glass playfully take it up smile throw his head back and drink the brandy off
instantly afterwards the company were seized with unspeakable consternation owing to his springing to his foot turning round several time in an appalling spasmodic whooping cough dance and rushing out at the door he then became visible through the window violently plunging and expectorating making the most hideous face and apparently out of his mind
i couldnt keep my eye off him i held on tight while mrs_joe_gargery and mrs_joe_gargery ran to him i didnt know how i had done it but i had no doubt
in my dreadful situation it was a relief when he was brought back and surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp tar
i had murdered him somehow i had filled up the bottle from the tar water jug i knew he would be worse by and by
i moved the table like a medium of the present day by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it
but uncle mr_pumblechook who was omnipotent in that kitchen wouldnt hear the word wouldnt hear of the subject imperiously waved it all away with his hand and asked for hot gin and water
my sister who had begun to be alarmingly meditative had to employ herself actively in getting the gin the hot water the sugar and the lemon peel and mixing them
tar cried my sister in amazement why how ever could tar come there for the time being at least i was saved
i still held on to the leg of the table but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude by degrees i became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding
mr_pumblechook partook of pudding all partook of pudding the course terminated and mr_pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water
i clutched the leg of the table again immediately and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul
i began to think i should get over the day when my sister said to mrs_joe_gargery clean plates cold i foresaw what was coming and i felt that this time i really was gone
you must taste said my sister addressing the guests with her best grace you must taste to finish with such a delightful and delicious present of uncle mr_pumblechook
must they let them not hope to taste it you must know said my sister rising it a pie a savory pork pie
the company murmured their compliments uncle mr_pumblechook sensible of having deserved well of his fellow creatures said quite vivaciously all thing considered well
mrs_joe_gargery we ll do our best endeavors let us have a cut at this same pie my sister went out to get it
i heard her steps proceed to the pantry i saw mr_pumblechook balance his knife i saw reawakening appetite in the roman nostrils of mr_wopsle
i heard mr hubble remark that a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention and do no harm and i heard mrs_joe_gargery say you shall have some mr_pip
i have never been absolutely certain whether i uttered a shrill yell of terror merely in spirit or in the bodily hearing of the company
i felt that i could bear no more and that i must run away i released the leg of the table and ran for my life
but i ran no farther than the house door for there i ran head foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me saying here you are look sharp come on
the apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but ends of their loaded muskets on our door step caused the dinner party to rise from table in confusion and caused mrs_joe_gargery re entering the kitchen empty handed to stop short and stare in her wondering lament of gracious goodness gracious me what gone with the pie
the sergeant and i were in the kitchen when mrs_joe_gargery stood staring at which crisis i partially recovered the use of my senses
it was the sergeant who had spoken to me and he was now looking round at the company with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand and his left on my shoulder
excuse me lady and gentleman said the sergeant but as i have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver which he hadnt i am on a chase in the name of the king and i want the blacksmith
chapter and pray what might you want with him retorted my sister quick to resent his being wanted at all
missis returned the gallant sergeant speaking for myself i should reply the honor and pleasure of his fine wife acquaintance speaking for the king i answer a little job done
you see blacksmith said the sergeant who had by this time picked out mrs_joe_gargery with his eye we have had an accident with these and i find the lock of one of em goes wrong and the coupling dont act pretty
this was received as rather neat in the sergeant insomuch that mr_pumblechook cried audibly good again as they are wanted for immediate service will you throw your eye over them
mrs_joe_gargery threw his eye over them and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his forge fire and would take nearer two hour than one
will it then will you set about it at once blacksmith said the off hand sergeant as it on his majesty service
with that he called to his man who came trooping into the kitchen one after another and piled their arm in a corner
and then they stood about as soldiers do now with their hand loosely clasped before them now resting a knee or a shoulder now easing a belt or a pouch now opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks out into the yard
and if my man can bear a hand anywhere they ll make themselves useful all these thing i saw without then knowing that i saw them for i was in an agony of apprehension
but beginning to perceive that the handcuffs were not for me and that the military had so far got the better of the pie as to put it in the background i collected a little more of my scattered wits
said the sergeant addressing himself to mr_pumblechook as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he was equal to the time
that not so bad said the sergeant reflecting even if i was forced to halt here nigh two hour that ll do
would you give me the time it just gone half past two how far might you call yourselves from the marsh hereabouts
not above a mile i reckon just a mile said mrs_joe_gargery that ll do we begin to close in upon em about dusk
a little before dusk my orders are that ll do convict sergeant asked mr_wopsle in a matter of course way ay returned the sergeant two
they re pretty well known to be out on the marsh still and they wont try to get clear of em before dusk
anybody here seen anything of any such game everybody myself excepted said no with confidence nobody thought of me
well said the sergeant they ll find themselves trapped in a circle i expect sooner than they count on now blacksmith if you re ready his majesty the king is
mrs_joe_gargery had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off and his leather apron on and passed into the forge
one of the soldiers opened its wooden window another lighted the fire another turned to at the bellows the rest stood round the blaze which was soon roaring
then mrs_joe_gargery began to hammer and clink hammer and clink and we all looked on the interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention but even made my sister liberal
she drew a pitcher of beer from the cask for the soldiers and invited the sergeant to take a glass of brandy
i ll engage there no tar in that so the sergeant thanked him and said that as he preferred his drink without tar he would take wine if it was equally convenient
when it was given him he drank his majesty health and compliments of the season and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips
but mr_pumblechook said sharply give him wine mum good stuff eh sergeant said mr_pumblechook i ll tell you something returned the sergeant i suspect that stuff of your providing
mr_pumblechook with a fat sort of laugh said ay ay why because returned the sergeant clapping him on the shoulder you re a man that knows what what
ye think so said mr_pumblechook with his former laugh have another glass with you hob and nob returned the sergeant
the top of mine to the foot of yours the foot of yours to the top of mine ring once ring twice the best tune on the musical glasses
may you live a thousand year and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life
i noticed that mr_pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine but took the bottle from mrs_joe_gargery and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality
your health the sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass even i got some
and he was so very free of the wine that he even called for the other bottle and handed that about with the same liberality when the first was gone
as i watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge enjoying themselves so much i thought what terrible good sauce for a dinner my fugitive friend on the marsh was
and now when they were all in lively anticipation of the two villains being taken and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives the fire to flare for them the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them mrs_joe_gargery to hammer and clink for them and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank and the red hot sparks dropped and died the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account poor wretches
they had not enjoyed themselves a quarter so much before the entertainment was brightened with the excitement he furnished at last mrs_joe_gargery job was done and the ringing and roaring stopped
as mrs_joe_gargery got on his coat he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt
mr_pumblechook and mr hubble declined on the plea of a pipe and lady society but mr_wopsle said he would go if mrs_joe_gargery would
we never should have got leave to go i am sure but for mrs_joe_gargery curiosity to know all about it and how it ended
as it was she merely stipulated if you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket dont look to me to put it together again
the sergeant took a polite leave of the lady and parted from mr_pumblechook as from a comrade though i doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman merits under arid conditions as when something moist was going
mrs_joe_gargery said he was agreeable and would take me if mrs_joe_gargery approved his man resumed their muskets and fell in
mr_wopsle mrs_joe_gargery and i received strict charge to keep in the rear and to speak no word after we reached the marsh
when we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business i treasonably whispered to mrs_joe_gargery i hope mrs_joe_gargery we shant find them
we were joined by no stragglers from the village for the weather was cold and threatening the way dreary the footing bad darkness coming on and the people had good fire in door and were keeping the day
and mrs_joe_gargery whispered to me i give a shilling if they had cut and run mr_pip a few face hurried to glowing window and looked after us but none came out
there we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant hand while two or three of his man dispersed themselves among the graves and also examined the porch
they came in again without finding anything and then we struck out on the open marsh through the gate at the side of the churchyard
we passed the finger post and held straight on to the churchyard a bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind and mrs_joe_gargery took me on his back
now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought i had been within eight or nine hour and had seen both man hiding i considered for the first time with great dread if we should come upon them would my particular convict suppose that it was i who had brought the soldiers there
he had asked me if i was a deceiving imp and he had said i should be a fierce young hound if i joined the hunt against him
would he believe that i was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest and had betrayed him it was of no use asking myself this question now
there i was on mrs_joe_gargery back and there was mrs_joe_gargery beneath me charging at the ditches like a hunter and stimulating mr_wopsle not to tumble on his roman nose and to keep up with us
the soldiers were in front of us extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man we were taking the course i had begun with and from which i had diverged in the mist
under the low red glare of sunset the beacon and the gibbet and the mound of the battery and the opposite shore of the river were plain though all of a watery lead color
with my heart thumping like a blacksmith at mrs_joe_gargery broad shoulder i looked all about for any sign of the convict
either the mist was not out again yet or the wind had dispelled it i could see none i could hear none
mr_wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once by his blowing and hard breathing but i knew the sounds by this time and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit
the sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us and the cattle their head turned from the wind and sleet stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances but except these thing and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marsh
the soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old battery and we were moving on a little way behind them when all of a sudden we all stopped
i got a dreadful start when i thought i heard the file still going but it was only a sheep bell for there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain a long shout
it was repeated it was at a distance towards the east but it was long and loud nay there seemed to be
two or more shouts raised together if one might judge from a confusion in the sound to this effect the sergeant and the nearest man were speaking under their breath when mrs_joe_gargery and i came up
the sergeant a decisive man ordered that the sound should not be answered but that the course should be changed and that his man should make towards it at the double
after another moment listening mrs_joe_gargery who was a good judge agreed and mr_wopsle who was a bad judge agreed
so we slanted to the right where the east was and mrs_joe_gargery pounded away so wonderfully that i had to hold on tight to keep my seat
it was a run indeed now and what mrs_joe_gargery called in the only two word he spoke all the time a winder
down banks and up banks and over gate and splashing into dikes and breaking among coarse rushes no man cared where he went
as we came nearer to the shouting it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice
sometimes it seemed to stop altogether and then the soldiers stopped when it broke out again the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever and we after them
after a while we had so run it down that we could hear one voice calling murder and another voice convict
runaways guard this way for the runaway convict then both voice would seem to be stifled in a struggle and then would break out again
the sergeant ran in first when we had run the noise quite down and two of his man ran in close upon him
and when it had come to this the soldiers ran like deer and mrs_joe_gargery too their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in
here are both man panted the sergeant struggling at the bottom of a ditch surrender you two and confound you for two wild beasts
water was splashing and mud was flying and oaths were being sworn and blows were being struck when some more man went down into the ditch to help the sergeant and dragged out separately my convict and the other one
come asunder both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling but of course i knew them both directly mind
said my convict wiping blood from his face with his ragged sleeves and shaking torn hair from his finger i took him
it not much to be particular about said the sergeant it ll do you small good my man being in the same plight yourself
i give him up to you mind that handcuffs there i dont expect it to do me any good i dont want it to do me more good than it does now said my convict with a greedy laugh
the other convict was livid to look at and in addition to the old bruised left side of his face seemed to be bruised and torn all over
he could not so much as get his breath to speak until they were both separately handcuffed but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from falling
i took him he knows it that enough for me take notice guard he tried to murder me were his first word
tried to murder him said my convict disdainfully try and not do it i took him and giv him up that what i done
i not only prevented him getting off the marsh but i dragged him here dragged him this far on his way back
he a gentleman if you please this villain now the hulks has got its gentleman again through me murder him worth my while too to murder him when i could do worse and drag him back
the other one still gasped he tried he tried to murder me bear bear witness lookee here said my convict to the sergeant
i could ha got clear of these death cold flats likewise look at my leg you wont find much iron on it if i hadnt made the discovery that he was here
single handed i got clear of the prison ship i made a dash and i done it let him go free let him profit by the means as i found out
if i had died at the bottom there and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled hand i have held to him with that grip that you should have been safe to find him in my hold
let him make a tool of me afresh and again once more no no no the other fugitive who was evidently in extreme horror of his companion repeated he tried to murder me
i should have been a dead man if you had not come up he lies said my convict with fierce energy
he a liar born and he ll die a liar look at his face aint it written there let him turn those eye of his on me
the other with an effort at a scornful smile which could not however collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression looked at the soldiers and looked about at the marsh and at the sky but certainly did not look at the speaker
i defy him to do it do you see him pursued my convict do you see what a villain he is
do you see those grovelling and wandering eye that how he looked when we were tried together he never looked at me
the other always working and working his dry lips and turning his eye restlessly about him far and near did at last turn them for a moment on the speaker with the word you are not much to look at and with a half taunting glance at the bound hand
at that point my convict became so frantically exasperated that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers
and any one could see that he shook with fear and that there broke out upon his lips curious white flakes like thin snow
didnt i tell you said the other convict then that he would murder me if he could
as one of the soldiers who carried a basket in lieu of a gun went down on his knee to open it my convict looked round him for the first time and saw me
i had alighted from mrs_joe_gargery back on the brink of the ditch when we came up and had not moved since
enough of this parley said the sergeant light those torches i looked at him eagerly when he looked at me and slightly moved my hand and shook my head
it was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended my intention for he gave me a look that i did not understand and it all passed in a moment
but if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day i could not have remembered his face ever afterwards as having been more attentive
the soldier with the basket soon got a light and lighted three or four torches and took one himself and distributed the others
i had been waiting for him to see me that i might try to assure him of my innocence it had been almost dark before but now it seemed quite dark and soon afterwards very dark
presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us and others on the marsh on the opposite bank of the river
before we departed from that spot four soldiers standing in a ring fired twice into the air all right said the sergeant
we had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear
march you are expected on board said the sergeant to my convict they know you are coming dont straggle my man
close up here the two were kept apart and each walked surrounded by a separate guard i had hold of mrs_joe_gargery hand now and mrs_joe_gargery carried one of the torches
mr_wopsle had been for going back but mrs_joe_gargery was resolved to see it out so we went on with the party
there was a reasonably good path now mostly on the edge of the river with a divergence here and there where a dike came with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice gate
the torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track and i could see those too lying smoking and flaring
when i looked round i could see the other light coming in after us i could see nothing else but black darkness
our light warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that as they limped along in the midst of the muskets
we could not go fast because of their lameness and they were so spent that two or three time we had to halt while they rested
after an hour or so of this travelling we came to a rough wooden hut and a landing place there was a guard in the hut and they challenged and the sergeant answered
then we went into the hut where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash and a bright fire and a lamp and a stand of muskets and a drum and a low wooden bedstead like an overgrown mangle without the machinery capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once
three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their great coats were not much interested in us but just lifted their head and took a sleepy stare and then lay down again
the sergeant made some kind of report and some entry in a book and then the convict whom i call the other convict was drafted off with his guard to go on board first
while we stood in the hut he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it or putting up his foot by turns upon the hob and looking thoughtfully at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures
my convict never looked at me except that once suddenly he turned to the sergeant and remarked i wish to say something respecting this escape
you can say what you like returned the sergeant standing coolly looking at him with his arm folded but you have no call to say it here
it may prevent some person laying under suspicion alonger me you ll have opportunity enough to say about it and hear about it before it done with you know
i know but this is another pint a separate matter a man cant starve at least i cant i took some wittles up at the willage over
yonder where the church stands a most out on the marsh you mean stole said the sergeant and i ll tell you where from
from the blacksmith halloa said the sergeant staring at mrs_joe_gargery halloa mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery staring at me it was some broken wittles that what it was and a dram of liquor and a pie
have you happened to miss such an article as a pie blacksmith asked the sergeant confidentially my wife did at the very moment when you came in
dont you know mr_pip so said my convict turning his eye on mrs_joe_gargery in a moody manner and without the least glance at me so
god knows you re welcome to it so far as it was ever mine returned mrs_joe_gargery with a saving remembrance of mrs_joe_gargery
we dont know what you have done but we wouldnt have you starved to death for it poor miserable fellow creatur would us mr_pip
you re the blacksmith are you than i sorry to say i ve eat your pie the something that i had noticed before clicked in the man throat again and he turned his back
the boat had returned and his guard were ready so we followed him to the landing place made of rough stakes and stones and saw him put into the boat which was rowed by a crew of convict like himself
no one seemed surprised to see him or interested in seeing him or glad to see him or sorry to see him or spoke a word except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs give way you which was the signal for the dip of the oars
by the light of the torches we saw the black hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore like a wicked noah ark
cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains the prison ship seemed in my young eye to be ironed like the prisoners
then the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water and went out as if it were all over with him
my state of mind regarding the pilfering from which i had been so unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure but i hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it
i do not recall that i felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to mrs_joe_gargery when the fear of being found out was lifted off me
but i loved mrs_joe_gargery perhaps for no better reason in those early day than because the dear fellow let me love him and as to him my inner self was not so easily composed
it was much upon my mind particularly when i first saw him looking about for his file that i ought to tell mrs_joe_gargery the whole truth
yet i did not and for the reason that i mistrusted that if i did he would think me worse than i was
the fear of losing mrs_joe_gargery confidence and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend tied up my tongue
i morbidly represented to myself that if mrs_joe_gargery knew it i never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker without thinking that he was meditating on it
that if mrs_joe_gargery knew it i never afterwards could see him glance however casually at yesterday meat or pudding when it came on to day table without thinking that he was debating whether i had been in the pantry
that if mrs_joe_gargery knew it and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick the conviction that he suspected tar in it would bring a rush of blood to my face
in a word i was too cowardly to do what i knew to be right as i had been too cowardly to avoid doing what i knew to be wrong
i had had no intercourse with the world at that time and i imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner
we saw the boat go alongside and we saw him taken up the side and disappear chapter vi quite an untaught genius i made the discovery of the line of action for myself
as i was sleepy before we were far away from the prison ship mrs_joe_gargery took me on his back again and carried me home
he must have had a tiresome journey of it for mr_wopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad temper that if the church had been thrown open he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition beginning with mrs_joe_gargery and myself
in his lay capacity he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have hanged him if it had been a capital offence
by that time i was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard through having been newly set upon my foot and through having been fast asleep and through waking in the heat and light and noise of tongues
was there ever such a boy as this from my sister i found mrs_joe_gargery telling them about the convict confession and all the visitors suggesting different way by which he had got into the pantry
mr_pumblechook made out after carefully surveying the premises that he had first got upon the roof of the forge and had then got upon the roof of the house and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips and as mr_pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaise cart over everybody it was agreed that it must be so
mr_wopsle indeed wildly cried out no with the feeble malice of a tired man but as he had no theory and no coat on he was unanimously set at naught not to mention his smoking hard behind as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out which was not calculated to inspire confidence
this was all i heard that night before my sister clutched me as a slumberous offence to the company eyesight and assisted me up to bed with such a strong hand that i seemed to have fifty boots on and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs
my state of mind as i have described it began before i was up in the morning and lasted long after the subject had died out and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasion
as i came to myself with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulder and the restorative exclamation yah chapter vii
at the time when i stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones i had just enough learning to be able to spell them out
my construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct for i read wife of the above as a complimentary reference to my father exaltation to a better world and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as below i have no doubt i should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family
neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my catechism bound me at all accurate for i have a lively remembrance that i supposed my declaration that i was to walk in the same all the day of my life laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright or up by the mill
when i was old enough i was to be apprenticed to mrs_joe_gargery and until i could assume that dignity i was not to be what mrs_joe_gargery called pompeyed or as i render it pampered
therefore i was not only odd boy about the forge but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten birds or pick up stones or do any such job i was favored with the employment
in order however that our superior position might not be compromised thereby a money box was kept on the kitchen mantel shelf into which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped
i have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the national debt but i know i had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure
mr_wopsle great aunt kept an evening school in the village that is to say she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it
she rented a small cottage and mr_wopsle had the room upstairs where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner and occasionally bumping on the ceiling
what he did on those occasion was to turn up his cuffs stick up his hair and give us mark antony oration over the body of caesar
this was always followed by collins ode on the passions wherein i particularly venerated mr_wopsle as revenge throwing his blood stained sword in thunder down and taking the war denouncing trumpet with a withering look
it was not with me then as it was in later life when i fell into the society of the passions and compared them with collins and mr_wopsle rather to the disadvantage of both gentleman
there was a fiction that mr_wopsle examined the scholars once a quarter mr_wopsle great aunt besides keeping this educational institution kept in the same room a little general shop
she had no idea what stock she had or what the price of anything in it was but there was a little greasy memorandum book kept in a drawer which served as a catalogue of prices and by this oracle biddy arranged all the shop transactions
biddy was mr_wopsle great aunt granddaughter i confess myself quite unequal to the working out of the problem what relation she was to mr_wopsle
she was most noticeable i thought in respect of her extremities for her hair always wanted brushing her hand always wanted washing and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel
she was an orphan like myself like me too had been brought up by hand this description must be received with a week day limitation
much of my unassisted self and more by the help of biddy than of mr_wopsle great aunt i struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramble bush getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter
after that i fell among those thieves the nine figures who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition
on sundays she went to church elaborated but at last i began in a purblind groping way to read write and cipher on the very smallest scale
one night i was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate expending great efforts on the production of a letter to mrs_joe_gargery
i think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marsh for it was a long time after and it was winter and a hard frost
with an alphabet on the hearth at my foot for reference i contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle mi deer jo
i ope r krwite well i ope i shal son habell teedge jo an then we shorl so glodd
there was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with mrs_joe_gargery by letter inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone
but i delivered this written communication slate and all with my own hand and mrs_joe_gargery received it as a miracle of erudition
an wen i prengtd jo wot larx an bleve me inf xn mr_pip i say mr_pip old chap
i should like to be said i glancing at the slate as he held it with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly
cried mrs_joe_gargery opening his blue eye wide what a scholar you are ant you why here a said mrs_joe_gargery and a equal to anythink
i had never heard mrs_joe_gargery read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable and i had observed at church last sunday when i accidentally held our prayer book upside down that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right
wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching mrs_joe_gargery i should have to begin quite at the beginning i said ah
here a and a mr_pip and a o mrs_joe_gargery but read the rest jo the rest eh mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery looking at it with a slow searching eye one two three
why here three js and three os and three o joes in it mr_pip i leaned over mrs_joe_gargery and with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole letter
astonishing said mrs_joe_gargery when i had finished you are a scholar how do you spell mrs_joe_gargery mrs_joe_gargery
i asked him with a modest patronage i dont spell it at all said mrs_joe_gargery but supposing you did
give me said mrs_joe_gargery a good book or a good newspaper and sit me down afore a good fire and i ask no better
it cant be supposed said mrs_joe_gargery tho i uncommon fond of reading too are you mrs_joe_gargery on common lord
he continued after rubbing his knees a little when you do come to a and a and says you here at last is a o mrs_joe_gargery how interesting reading is
i derived from this that mrs_joe_gargery education like steam was yet in its infancy pursuing the subject i inquired didnt you ever go to school
mrs_joe_gargery when you were as little as me no mr_pip why didnt you ever go to school mrs_joe_gargery when you were as little as me
well mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery taking up the poker and settling himself to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars i ll tell you
my father mr_pip he were given to drink and when he were overtook with drink he hammered away at my mother most onmerciful
and he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he didnt hammer at his anwil you re a listening and understanding mr_pip
consequence my mother and me we ran away from my father several time and then my mother she go out to work and she say mrs_joe_gargery she say now please god you shall have some schooling child and she put me to school
it were a most the only hammering he did indeed xcepting at myself yes mrs_joe_gargery but my father were that good in his hart that he couldnt abear to be without us
so he come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the door of the house where we was that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him
which you see mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery pausing in his meditative raking of the fire and looking at me were a drawback on my learning
though mind you mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar rendering unto all their doo and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man my father were that good in his hart dont you see
and then he took us home and hammered us certainly poor mrs_joe_gargery i didnt see but i didnt say so
well mrs_joe_gargery pursued somebody must keep the pot a biling mr_pip or the pot wont bile dont you know i saw that and said so
consequence my father didnt make objections to my going to work so i went to work at my present calling which were his too if he would have followed it and i worked tolerable hard
in time i were able to keep him and i kep him till he went off in a purple leptic fit
and it were my intentions to have had put upon his tombstone that whatsume er the failings on his part remember reader
mrs_joe_gargery recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity that i asked him if he had made it himself
i assure you mr_pip he were that good in his heart i made it said mrs_joe_gargery my own self
i made it in a moment it was like striking out a horseshoe complete in a single blow i never was so much surprised in all my life couldnt credit
as i was saying mr_pip it were my intentions to have had it cut over him but poetry costs money cut it how you will small or large and it were not done
my own ed to tell you the truth hardly believed it were my own ed not to mention bearers all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother
she were in poor elth and quite broke she werent long of following poor soul and her share of peace come round at last
mrs_joe_gargery blue eye turned a little watery he rubbed first one of them and then the other in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner with the round knob on the top of the poker
now mr_pip mrs_joe_gargery looked firmly at me as if he knew i was not going to agree with him your sister is a fine figure of a woman
it were but lonesome then said mrs_joe_gargery living here alone and i got acquainted with your sister i could not help looking at the fire in an obvious state of doubt
whatever family opinions or whatever the world opinions on that subject may be mr_pip your sister is mrs_joe_gargery tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following a fine figure of a woman
i could think of nothing better to say than i am glad you think so mrs_joe_gargery so am i returned mrs_joe_gargery catching me up
i am glad i think so mr_pip a little redness or a little matter of bone here or there what does it signify to me
i sagaciously observed if it didnt signify to him to whom did it signify certainly assented mrs_joe_gargery that it
you re right old chap when i got acquainted with your sister it were the talk how she was bringing you up by hand
as to you mrs_joe_gargery pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed if you could have been aware how small and flabby and
very kind of her too all the folks said and i said along with all the folks mean you was dear me you have formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself
not exactly relishing this i said never mind me mrs_joe_gargery but i did mind you mr_pip he returned with tender simplicity
when i offered to your sister to keep company and to be asked in church at such time as she was willing and ready to come to the forge i said to her and bring the poor little child
i broke out crying and begging pardon and hugged mrs_joe_gargery round the neck who dropped the poker to hug me and to say ever the best of friend ant us mr_pip
god bless the poor little child i said to your sister there room for him at the forge dont cry old chap
when this little interruption was over mrs_joe_gargery resumed well you see mr_pip and here we are that about where it light here we are
now when you take me in hand in my learning mr_pip and i tell you beforehand i am awful dull most awful dull mrs_joe_gargery mustnt see too much of what we re up to
it must be done as i may say on the sly and why on the sly i ll tell you why mr_pip
he had taken up the poker again without which i doubt if he could have proceeded in his demonstration
and i am afraid i must add hope that mrs_joe_gargery had divorced her in a favor of the lords of the admiralty or treasury
your sister is given to government given to government mrs_joe_gargery i was startled for i had some shadowy idea
and she ant over partial to having scholars on the premises mrs_joe_gargery continued and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a scholar for fear as i might rise
given to government said mrs_joe_gargery which i meantersay the government of you and myself oh like a sort of rebel dont you see
i was going to retort with an inquiry and had got as far as why when mrs_joe_gargery stopped me
stay a bit i know what you re a going to say mr_pip stay a bit i dont deny that your sister comes the mo gul over us now and again
at such time as when your sister is on the ram page mr_pip mrs_joe_gargery sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door candor compels fur to admit that she is a buster
i dont deny that she do throw us back falls and that she do drop down upon us heavy mrs_joe_gargery pronounced this word as if it began with at least twelve capital bs
well said mrs_joe_gargery passing the poker in to his left hand that he might feel his whisker and i had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation
why dont i rise that were your observation when i broke it off mr_pip yes mrs_joe_gargery your sister a master mind
but mrs_joe_gargery was readier with his definition than i had expected and completely stopped me by arguing circularly and answering with a fixed look her
a master mind what that i asked in some hope of bringing him to a stand and i aint a master mind mrs_joe_gargery resumed when he had unfixed his look and got back to his whisker
i want to say very serious to you old chap i see so much in my poor mother of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal day that i dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing what right by a woman and i fur rather of the two go wrong thet other way and be a little ill conwenienced myself
i wish it was only me that got put out mr_pip i wish there warnt no tickler for you old chap i wish i could take it all on myself but this is the up and down and straight on it mr_pip and i hope you ll overlook shortcomings
and last of all mr_pip and this young as i was i believe that i dated a new admiration of mrs_joe_gargery from that night
we were equals afterwards as we had been before but afterwards at quiet time when i sat looking at mrs_joe_gargery and thinking about him i had a new sensation of feeling conscious that i was looking up to mrs_joe_gargery in my heart
however said mrs_joe_gargery rising to replenish the fire here the dutch clock a working himself up to being equal to strike eight of em and she not come home yet
mrs_joe_gargery made occasional trips with uncle mr_pumblechook on market day to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman judgment uncle mr_pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant
i hope uncle mr_pumblechook mare maynt have set a forefoot on a piece ice and gone down this was market day and mrs_joe_gargery was out on one of these expeditions
mrs_joe_gargery made the fire and swept the hearth and then we went to the door to listen for the chaise cart it was a dry cold night and the wind blew keenly and the frost was white and hard
and then i looked at the stars and considered how awful it would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude
a man would die to night of lying out on the marsh i thought here comes the mare said mrs_joe_gargery ringing like a peal of bells
the sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual
we got a chair out ready for mrs_joe_gargery alighting and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place
mrs_joe_gargery was soon landed and uncle mr_pumblechook was soon down too covering the mare with a cloth and we were soon all in the kitchen carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire
now said mrs_joe_gargery unwrapping herself with haste and excitement and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulder where it hung by the strings if this boy aint grateful this night he never will be
when we had completed these preparations they drove up wrapped to the eye i looked as grateful as any boy possibly could who was wholly uninformed why he ought to assume that expression
it only to be hoped said my sister that he wont be pompeyed but i have my fears
she aint in that line mum said mr_pumblechook she knows better she i looked at mrs_joe_gargery making the motion with my lips and eyebrows
my sister catching him in the act he drew the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasion and looked at her
she mrs_joe_gargery looked at me making the motion with his lips and eyebrows she well said my sister in her snappish way
what are you staring at is the house afire which some individual mrs_joe_gargery politely hinted mentioned she and she is a she i suppose
said my sister unless you call miss_havisham a he and i doubt if even you ll go so far as that
miss_havisham up town said mrs_joe_gargery is there any miss_havisham down town returned my sister she wants this boy to go and play there
and he had better play there said my sister shaking her head at me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive or i ll work him
miles round had heard of miss_havisham up town as an immensely rich and grim lady who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers and who led a life of seclusion
and of course he going i had heard of miss_havisham up town everybody for well to be sure said mrs_joe_gargery astounded
i wonder how she come to know mr_pip noodle cried my sister who said she knew him which some individual mrs_joe_gargery again politely hinted mentioned that she wanted him to go and play there
isnt it just barely possible that uncle mr_pumblechook may be a tenant of hers and that he may sometimes we wont say quarterly or half yearly for that would be requiring too much of you but sometimes go there to pay his rent
and couldnt she ask uncle mr_pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there and couldnt she then ask uncle mr_pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there
and couldnt uncle mr_pumblechook being always considerate and thoughtful for us though you may not think it joseph_gargery in a tone of the deepest reproach as if he were the most callous of nephews then mention this boy standing prancing here which
i solemnly declare i was not doing that i have for ever been a willing slave to good again cried uncle mr_pumblechook
no joseph_gargery said my sister still in a reproachful manner while mrs_joe_gargery apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose you do not yet though you may not think it know the case
well put prettily pointed good indeed now joseph_gargery you know the case you may consider that you do but you do not joseph_gargery
for you do not know that uncle mr_pumblechook being sensible that for anything we can tell this boy fortune may be made by his going to miss_havisham has offered to take him into town to night in his own chaise cart and to keep him to night and to take him with his own hand to miss_havisham to morrow morning
here i stand talking to mere mooncalfs with uncle mr_pumblechook waiting and the mare catching cold at the door and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his foot
with that she pounced upon me like an eagle on a lamb and my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks and my head was put under taps of water butts and i was soaped and kneaded and towelled and thumped and harrowed and rasped until i really was quite beside myself
i may here remark that i suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living authority with the ridgy effect of a wedding ring passing unsympathetically over the human countenance
when my ablutions were completed i was put into clean linen of the stiffest character like a young penitent into sackcloth and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit
i was then delivered over to mr_pumblechook who formally received me as if he were the sheriff and who let off upon me the speech that i knew he had been dying to make all along boy be forever grateful to all friend but especially unto them which brought you up by hand
and lor a mussy me cried my sister casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation good bye mrs_joe_gargery god bless you mr_pip old chap
i had never parted from him before and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds i could at first see no stars from the chaise cart
but they twinkled out one by one without throwing any light on the question why on earth i was going to play at miss_havisham and what on earth
mr_pumblechook premises in the high street of the market town were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character as the premises of a cornchandler and seedsman should be
it appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed to have so many little drawers in his shop and i wondered when i peeped into one or two on the lower tiers and saw the tied up brown paper packets inside whether the flower seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails and bloom
i was expected to play at chapter viii it was in the early morning after my arrival that i entertained this speculation
on the previous night i had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was that i calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows
mr_pumblechook wore corduroys and so did his shopman and somehow there was a general air and flavor about the corduroys so much in the nature of seeds and a general air and flavor about the seeds so much in the nature of corduroys that i hardly knew which was which
the same opportunity served me for noticing that mr_pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker who appeared to get on in life by putting his hand in his pocket and contemplating the baker who in his turn folded his arm and stared at the grocer who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist
the watchmaker always poring over a little desk with a magnifying glass at his eye and always inspected by a group of smock frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop window seemed to be about the only person in the high street whose trade engaged his attention
mr_pumblechook and i breakfasted at eight clock in the parlor behind the shop while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises
besides being possessed by my sister idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my diet besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogether his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic
in the same early morning i discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys i considered mr_pumblechook wretched company on my politely bidding him good morning he said pompously seven time nine boy
and how should i be able to answer dodged in that way in a strange place on an empty stomach
i was hungry but before i had swallowed a morsel he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast
seven and four and eight and six and two and ten and so on
and after each figure was disposed of it was as much as i could do to get a bite or a sup before the next came while he sat at his ease guessing nothing and eating bacon and hot roll in if i may be allowed the expression a gorging and gormandizing manner
for such reason i was very glad when ten clock came and we started for miss_havisham though i was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which i should acquit myself under that lady roof
within a quarter of an hour we came to miss_havisham house which was of old brick and dismal and had a great many iron bars to it
there was a courtyard in front and that was barred so we had to wait after ringing the bell until some one should come to open it
some of the window had been walled up of those that remained all the lower were rustily barred while we waited at the gate i peeped in even then mr_pumblechook said and fourteen
but i pretended not to hear him and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery
no brewing was going on in it and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time a window was raised and a clear voice demanded what name
the voice returned quite right and the window was shut again and a young lady came across the court yard with keys in her hand
to which my conductor replied mr_pumblechook this said mr_pumblechook is mr_pip this is mr_pip is it
returned the young lady who was very pretty and seemed very proud come in mr_pip mr_pumblechook was coming in also when she stopped him with the gate
oh she said did you wish to see miss_havisham if miss_havisham wished to see me returned mr_pumblechook discomfited
she said it so finally and in such an undiscussible way that mr_pumblechook though in a condition of ruffled dignity could not protest
ah said the girl but you see she dont but he eyed me severely as if i had done anything to him and departed with the word reproachfully delivered boy
let your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand i was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound through the gate and sixteen
but he didnt my young conductress locked the gate and we went across the courtyard it was paved and clean but grass was growing in every crevice
the brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it and the wooden gate of that lane stood open and all the brewery beyond stood open away to the high enclosing wall and all was empty and disused
the cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open side of the brewery like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea
she saw me looking at it and she said you could drink without hurt all the strong beer that brewed there now boy
i should think i could miss said i in a shy way better not try to brew beer there now or it would turn out sour boy
not that anybody means to try she added for that all done with and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls
dont you think so it look like it miss as to strong beer there enough of it in the cellars already to drown the manor house
is that the name of this house miss one of its name boy it has more than one then miss
one more its other name was satis which is greek or latin or hebrew or all three or all one to me for enough
enough house said i that a curious name miss yes she replied but it meant more than it said
it meant when it was given that whoever had this house could want nothing else they must have been easily satisfied in those day i should think
though she called me boy so often and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary she was of about my own age
she seemed much older than i of course being a girl and beautiful and self possessed and she was as scornful of me as if she had been one and twenty and a queen
but dont loiter boy we went into the house by a side door the great front entrance had two chains across it outside and
the first thing i noticed was that the passages were all dark and that she had left a candle burning there
she took it up and we went through more passages and up a staircase and still it was all dark and only the candle lighted us
at last we came to the door of a room and she said go in i answered more in shyness than politeness after you miss
to this she returned dont be ridiculous boy i am not going in and scornfully walked away and what was worse took the candle with her
however the only thing to be done being to knock at the door i knocked and was told from within to enter
this was very uncomfortable and i was half afraid i entered therefore and found myself in a pretty large room well lighted with wax candles
it was a dressing room as i supposed from the furniture though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me
but prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking glass and that i made out at first sight to be a fine lady dressing table
whether i should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it i cannot say
in an arm chair with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand sat the strangest lady i have ever seen or shall ever see
no glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it she was dressed in rich materials satins and lace and silks all of white
and she had a long white veil dependent from her hair and she had bridal flowers in her hair but her hair was white
her shoes were white some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hand and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table
she had not quite finished dressing for she had but one shoe on the other was on the table near her hand her veil was but half arranged her watch and chain were not put on and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets and with her handkerchief and gloves and some flowers and a prayer book all confusedly heaped about the looking glass
it was not in the first few moment that i saw all these thing though i saw more of them in the first moment than might be supposed
but i saw that everything within my view which ought to be white had been white long ago and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow
i saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress and like the flowers and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eye
i saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone
once i had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the fair representing i know not what impossible personage lying in state
once i had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement
dresses less splendid than the dress she wore and half packed trunks were scattered about now waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eye that moved and looked at me
i should have cried out if i could who is it said the lady at the table mr_pip ma am
it was when i stood before her avoiding her eye that i took note of the surrounding objects in detail and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine
mr_pip mr_pumblechook boy ma am come to play come nearer let me look at you come close look at me said miss_havisham
you are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born i regret to state that i was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer
no do you know what i touch here she said laying her hand one upon the other on her left side
yes ma am it made me think of the young man what do i touch your heart broken
she uttered the word with an eager look and with strong emphasis and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it
afterwards she kept her hand there for a little while and slowly took them away as if they were heavy
i think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstance
i am tired said miss_havisham i want diversion and i have done with man and woman play
i sometimes have sick fancies she went on and i have a sick fancy that i want to see some play
for a moment with the fear of my sister working me before my eye i had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of mr_pumblechook chaise cart
but i felt myself so unequal to the performance that i gave it up and stood looking at miss_havisham in what i suppose she took for a dogged manner inasmuch as she said
there there with an impatient movement of the finger of her right hand play play play when we had taken a good look at each other are you sullen and obstinate
if you complain of me i shall get into trouble with my sister so i would do it if i could but it so new here and so strange and so fine and melancholy
i stopped fearing i might say too much or had already said it and we took another look at each other
before she spoke again she turned her eye from me and looked at the dress she wore and at the dressing table and finally at herself in the looking glass
so new to him she muttered so old to me so strange to him so familiar to me so melancholy to both of us
no ma am i am very sorry for you and very sorry i cant play just now call miss_estella
as she was still looking at the reflection of herself i thought she was still talking to herself and kept quiet
call miss_estella she repeated flashing a look at me you can do that call miss_estella at the door
to stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house bawling miss_estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name was almost as bad as playing to order
miss_havisham beckoned her to come close and took up a jewel from the table and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair
but she answered at last and her light came along the dark passage like a star your own one day my dear and you will use it well
let me see you play cards with this boy with this boy why he is a common laboring boy
i thought i overheard miss_havisham answer only it seemed so unlikely well you can break his heart what do you play boy
asked miss_estella of myself with the greatest disdain nothing but beggar my neighbor miss beggar him said miss_havisham to miss_estella
it was then i began to understand that everything in the room had stopped like the watch and the clock a long time ago
so we sat down to cards i noticed that miss_havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had taken it up
as miss_estella dealt the cards i glanced at the dressing table again and saw that the shoe upon it once white now yellow had never been worn
i glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent and saw that the silk stocking on it once white now yellow had been trodden ragged
without this arrest of everything this standing still of all the pale decayed objects not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like grave clothes or the long veil so like a shroud
so she sat corpse like as we played at cards the frillings and trimmings on her bridal dress looking like earthy paper
i knew nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in ancient time which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly seen but i have often thought since that she must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust
he calls the knaves jacks this boy said miss_estella with disdain before our first game was out and what coarse hand he has
i had never thought of being ashamed of my hand before but i began to consider them a very indifferent pair
and what thick boots her contempt for me was so strong that it became infectious and i caught it she won the game and i dealt
i misdealt as was only natural when i knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong and she denounced me for a stupid clumsy laboring boy
you say nothing of her remarked miss_havisham to me as she looked on she says many hard thing of you but you say nothing of her
what do you think of her i dont like to say i stammered tell me in my ear said miss_havisham bending down
i think she is very proud i replied in a whisper anything else i think she is very pretty
anything else i think she is very insulting she was looking at me then with a look of supreme aversion
anything else i think i should like to go home and never see her again though she is so pretty
i am not sure that i shouldnt like to see her again but i should like to go home now you shall go soon said miss_havisham aloud
saving for the one weird smile at first i should have felt almost sure that miss_havisham face could not smile
play the game out it had dropped into a watchful and brooding expression most likely when all the thing about her had become transfixed and
her chest had dropped so that she stooped and her voice had dropped so that she spoke low and with a dead lull upon her altogether she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul within and without under the weight of a crushing blow
it looked as if nothing could ever lift it up again i played the game to an end with miss_estella and she beggared me
she threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all as if she despised them for having been won of me
i was beginning to remind her that to day was wednesday when she checked me with her former impatient movement of the finger of her right hand
when shall i have you here again said miss_havisham let me think there there i know nothing of day of the week i know nothing of weeks of the year
come again after six day you hear yes ma am miss_estella take him down let him have something to eat and let him roam and look about him while he eats
i followed the candle down as i had followed the candle up and she stood it in the place where we had found it
go mr_pip until she opened the side entrance i had fancied without thinking about it that it must necessarily be night time
the rush of the daylight quite confounded me and made me feel as if i had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hour
you are to wait here you boy said miss_estella and disappeared and closed the door i took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my coarse hand and my common boots
my opinion of those accessories was not favorable they had never troubled me before but they troubled me now as vulgar appendages
i determined to ask mrs_joe_gargery why he had ever taught me to call those picture cards jacks which ought to be called knaves
i wished mrs_joe_gargery had been rather more genteelly brought up and then i should have been so too she came back with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer
she put the mug down on the stones of the yard and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me as insolently as if i were a dog in disgrace
i was so humiliated hurt spurned offended angry sorry i cannot hit upon the right name for the smart god knows what its name was that tears started to my eye
the moment they sprang there the girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them
this gave me power to keep them back and to look at her so she gave a contemptuous toss but with a sense i thought of having made too sure that i was so wounded and left me
but when she was gone i looked about me for a place to hide my face in and got behind one of the gate in the brewery lane and leaned my sleeve against the wall there and leaned my forehead on it and cried
as i cried i kicked the wall and took a hard twist at my hair so bitter were my feelings and so sharp was the smart without a name that needed counteraction
in the little world in which child have their existence whosoever brings them up there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice
it may be only small injustice that the child can be exposed to but the child is small and its world is small and its rocking horse stands as many hand high according to scale as a big boned irish hunter
my sister bringing up had made me sensitive within myself i had sustained from my babyhood a perpetual conflict with injustice
i had known from the time when i could speak that my sister in her capricious and violent coercion was unjust to me
i had cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her no right to bring me up by jerks
through all my punishments disgraces fasts and vigils and other penitential performances i had nursed this assurance and to my communing so much with it in a solitary and unprotected way i in great part refer the fact that i was morally timid and very sensitive
i got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall and twisting them out of my hair and then i smoothed my face with my sleeve and came from behind the gate
the bread and meat were acceptable and the beer was warming and tingling and i was soon in spirits to look about me
to be sure it was a deserted place down to the pigeon house in the brewery yard which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it
but there were no pigeons in the dove cot no horses in the stable no pigs in the sty no malt in the storehouse
no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat all the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke
in a by yard there was a wilderness of empty casks which had a certain sour remembrance of better day lingering about them but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone and in this respect
behind the furthest end of the brewery was a rank garden with an old wall not so high but that i could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths as if some one sometimes walked there and that miss_estella was walking away from me even then
for when i yielded to the temptation presented by the casks and began to walk on them i saw her walking on them at the end of the yard of casks
she had her back towards me and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hand and never looked round and passed out of my view directly
so in the brewery itself by which i mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer and where the brewing utensils still were
when i first went into it and rather oppressed by its gloom stood near the door looking about me i saw her pass among the extinguished fire and ascend some light iron stairs and go out by a gallery high overhead as if she were going out into the sky
i remember those recluses as being like most others but she seemed to be everywhere it was in this place and at this moment that a strange thing happened to my fancy
i turned my eye a little dimmed by looking up at the frosty light towards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand and i saw a figure hanging there by the neck
a figure all in yellow white with but one shoe to the foot and it hung so that i could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper and that the face was miss_havisham with a movement going over the whole countenance as if she were trying to call to me
in the terror of seeing the figure and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment before i at first ran from it and then ran towards it
i thought it a strange thing then and i thought it a stranger thing long afterwards and my terror was greatest of all when i found no figure there
nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky the sight of people passing beyond the bars of the court yard gate and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer would have brought me round
even with those aids i might not have come to myself as soon as i did but that i saw miss_estella approaching with the keys to let me out
she would have some fair reason for looking down upon me i thought if she saw me frightened and she would have no fair reason
she gave me a triumphant glance in passing me as if she rejoiced that my hand were so coarse and my boots were so thick and she opened the gate and stood holding it
i was passing out without looking at her when she touched me with a taunting hand why dont you cry
because i dont want to you do said she you have been crying till you are half blind and you are near crying again now
she laughed contemptuously pushed me out and locked the gate upon me i went straight to mr_pumblechook and was immensely relieved to find him not at home
so leaving word with the shopman on what day i was wanted at miss_havisham again i set off on the four mile walk to our forge pondering as i went along on all i had seen and deeply revolving that i was a common laboring boy that my hand were coarse that my boots were thick that i had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves jacks that i was much more ignorant than i had considered myself last night and generally that i was in a low lived bad way
when i reached home my sister was very curious to know all about miss_havisham and asked a number of question
and i soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall because i did not answer those question at sufficient length
if a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in mine which
chapter ix i consider probable as i have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity it is the key to many reservations
not only that but i felt convinced that miss_havisham too would not be understood and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me i entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was to say nothing of miss_estella before the contemplation of mrs_joe_gargery
i felt convinced that if i described miss_havisham as my eye had seen it i should not be understood consequently i said as little as i could and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall
the worst of it was that that bullying old mr_pumblechook preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all i had seen and heard came gaping over in his chaise cart at tea time to have the details divulged to him
and the mere sight of the torment with his fishy eye and mouth open his sandy hair inquisitively on end and his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic made me vicious in my reticence
well boy uncle mr_pumblechook began as soon as he was seated in the chair of honor by the fire
how did you get on up town i answered pretty well sir and my sister shook her fist at me
pretty well mr_pumblechook repeated pretty well is no answer tell us what you mean by pretty well boy
whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy perhaps anyhow with whitewash from the wall on my forehead my obstinacy was adamantine
i reflected for some time and then answered as if i had discovered a new idea i mean pretty well
my sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me i had no shadow of defence for mrs_joe_gargery was busy in the forge when
mr_pumblechook interposed with no dont lose your temper leave this lad to me ma am leave this lad to me
mr_pumblechook then turned me towards him as if he were going to cut my hair and said first to get our thought in order
i calculated the consequences of replying four hundred pound and finding them against me went as near the answer as i could which was somewhere about eightpence off
mr_pumblechook then put me through my pence table from twelve pence make one shilling up to forty pence make three and fourpence and then triumphantly demanded as if he had done for me now
forty three pence how much is forty three pence to which i replied after a long interval of reflection i dont know
mr_pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me and said is forty three pence seven and sixpence three fardens for instance
and although my sister instantly boxed my ears it was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke and brought him to a dead stop
and i was so aggravated that i almost doubt if i did know yes said i boy what like is miss_havisham
mr_pumblechook began again when he had recovered folding his arm tight on his chest and applying the screw
mr_pumblechook winked assent from which i at once inferred that he had never seen miss_havisham for she was nothing of the kind
very tall and dark i told him is she uncle asked my sister good said mr_pumblechook conceitedly
i am sure uncle returned mrs_joe_gargery i wish you had him always you know so well how to deal with him
this is the way to have him we are beginning to hold our own i think mum now boy what was she a doing of when you went in today asked mr_pumblechook
she was sitting i answered in a black velvet coach mr_pumblechook and mrs_joe_gargery stared at one another as they well might and both repeated in a black velvet coach
yes said i and miss_estella that her niece i think handed her in cake and wine at the coach window on a gold plate
and we all had cake and wine on gold plates and i got up behind the coach to eat mine because she told me to
was anybody else there asked mr_pumblechook four dogs said i large or small immense said i and they fought for veal cutlets out of a silver basket
mr_pumblechook and mrs_joe_gargery stared at one another again in utter amazement i was perfectly frantic a reckless witness under the torture and would have told them anything
where was this coach in the name of gracious asked my sister in miss_havisham room they stared again
i added this saving clause in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which i had had wild thought of harnessing
but there werent any horses to it can this be possible uncle asked mrs_joe_gargery what can the boy mean
i ll tell you mum said mr_pumblechook my opinion is it a sedan chair she flighty you know very flighty quite flighty enough to pass her day in a sedan chair
did you ever see her in it uncle asked mrs_joe_gargery how could i he returned forced to the admission when i never see her in my life
why dont you know said mr_pumblechook testily that when i have been there i have been took up to the outside of her door and the door has stood ajar and she has spoke to me that way
never clapped eye upon her goodness uncle and yet you have spoken to her dont say you dont know that mum
i beg to observe that i think of myself with amazement when i recall the lies i told on this occasion
howsever the boy went there to play what did you play at boy we played with flags i said flags echoed my sister
miss_estella waved a blue flag and i waved a red one and miss_havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars out at the coach window
yes said i and then we all waved our swords and hurrahed swords repeated my sister where did you get swords from
out of a cupboard said i and i saw pistols in it and jam and pills and there was no daylight in the room but it was all lighted up with candles
that true mum said mr_pumblechook with a grave nod that the state of the case for that much i ve seen myself
and then they both stared at me and i with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance stared at them and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand
if they had asked me any more question i should undoubtedly have betrayed myself for i was even then on the point of mentioning that there was a balloon in the yard and should have hazarded the statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery
they were so much occupied however in discussing the marvels i had already presented for their consideration that i escaped
to whom my sister more for the relief of her own mind than for the gratification of his related my pretended experiences
now when i saw mrs_joe_gargery open his blue eye and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement i was overtaken by penitence but only as regarded him not in the least as regarded the other two
towards mrs_joe_gargery and mrs_joe_gargery only i considered myself a young monster while they sat debating what results would come to me from miss_havisham acquaintance and favor
they had no doubt that miss_havisham would do something for me their doubts related to the form that something would take
the subject still held them when mrs_joe_gargery came in from his work to have a cup of tea my sister stood out for property
mr_pumblechook was in favor of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade say the corn and seed trade for instance
mrs_joe_gargery fell into the deepest disgrace with both for offering the bright suggestion that i might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal cutlets
if a fool head cant express better opinions than that said my sister and you have got any work to do you had better go and do it
after mr_pumblechook had driven off and when my sister was washing up i stole into the forge to mrs_joe_gargery and remained by him until he had done for the night
so he went then i said before the fire goes out mrs_joe_gargery i should like to tell you something
mrs_joe_gargery said i taking hold of his rolled up shirt sleeve and twisting it between my finger and thumb you remember all that about miss_havisham
should you mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery drawing his shoeing stool near the forge then tell us what is it mr_pip remember said mrs_joe_gargery
i believe you wonderful it a terrible thing mrs_joe_gargery it aint true what are you telling of mr_pip
cried mrs_joe_gargery falling back in the greatest amazement you dont mean to say it yes i do it lies mrs_joe_gargery
but not all of it why sure you dont mean to say mr_pip that there was no black welwet co eh
for i stood shaking my head but at least there was dogs mr_pip come mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery persuasively if there warn t
no weal cutlets at least there was dogs no mrs_joe_gargery a dog said mrs_joe_gargery a puppy come no mrs_joe_gargery there was nothing at all of the kind
as i fixed my eye hopelessly on mrs_joe_gargery joe contemplated me in dismay mr_pip old chap this wont do old fellow
i say where do you expect to go to it terrible mrs_joe_gargery aint it terrible cried mrs_joe_gargery awful what possessed you
i dont know what possessed me mrs_joe_gargery i replied letting his shirt sleeve go and sitting down in the ashes at his foot hanging my head
but i wish you hadnt taught me to call knaves at cards jacks and i wish my boots werent so thick nor my hand so coarse
and then i told mrs_joe_gargery that i felt very miserable and that i hadnt been able to explain myself to mrs_joe_gargery and mr_pumblechook who were so rude to me and that there had been a beautiful young lady at miss_havisham who was dreadfully proud and that she had said i was common and that i knew i was common and that i wished i was not common and that the lies had come of it somehow though i didnt know how
this was a case of metaphysics at least as difficult for mrs_joe_gargery to deal with as for me but mrs_joe_gargery took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics and by that means vanquished it
howsever they come they didnt ought to come and they come from the father of lies and work round to the same
there one thing you may be sure of mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery after some rumination namely that lies is lies dont you tell no more of em mr_pip
that aint the way to get out of being common old chap and as to being common i dont make it out at all clear
you are oncommon in some thing you re oncommon small likewise you re a oncommon scholar no i am ignorant and backward mrs_joe_gargery
why see what a letter you wrote last night wrote in print even i ve seen letters ah and from gentlefolks that i ll swear werent wrote in print said mrs_joe_gargery
i have learnt next to nothing mrs_joe_gargery you think much of me it only that well mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery be it so or be it son t
the king upon his throne with his crown upon his ed cant sit and write his acts of parliament in print without having begun when he were a unpromoted prince with the alphabet ah added mrs_joe_gargery with a shake of the head that was full of meaning and begun at a too and worked his way to
you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one i should hope and i know what that is to do though i cant say i ve exactly done it
whether common one as to callings and earnings pursued mrs_joe_gargery reflectively mightnt be the better of continuing for to keep company with common one
there was some hope in this piece of wisdom and it rather encouraged me instead of going out to play with oncommon one which reminds me to hope that there were a flag perhaps
whether that might be or mightnt be is a thing as cant be looked into now without putting your sister on the rampage and that a thing not to be thought of as being done intentional
no mrs_joe_gargery i sorry there werent a flag mr_pip lookee here mr_pip at what is said to you by a true friend
which this to you the true friend say if you cant get to be oncommon through going straight you ll never get to do it through going crooked
so dont tell no more on em mr_pip and live well and die happy you are not angry with me mrs_joe_gargery
but bearing in mind that them were which i meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort alluding to them which bordered on weal cutlets and dog fighting a
no old chap sincere well wisher would adwise mr_pip their being dropped into your meditations when you go upstairs to bed that all old chap and dont never do it no more
when i got up to my little room and said my prayers i did not forget mrs_joe_gargery recommendation and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state
that i thought long after i laid me down how common miss_estella would consider mrs_joe_gargery a mere blacksmith how thick his boots and how coarse his hand
i thought how mrs_joe_gargery and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen and how i had come up to bed from the kitchen and how miss_havisham and miss_estella never sat in a kitchen but were far above the level of such common doings
i fell asleep recalling what i used to do when i was at miss_havisham as though i had been there weeks or months instead of hour and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance instead of one that had arisen only that day
that was a memorable day to me for it made great changes in me but it is the same with any life
pause you who read this and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold of thorns or flowers that would never have bound you but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day
the felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when i woke that the best step i could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of biddy everything she knew
in pursuance of this luminous conception i mentioned to biddy when i went to mr_wopsle great aunt at night that i had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life and that i should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart all her learning to me
biddy who was the most obliging of girls immediately said she would and indeed began to carry out her promise within five minutes
imagine one selected day struck out of it and think how different its course would have been chapter the educational scheme or course established by mr_wopsle great aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis
the pupils ate apples and put straws down one another back until mr_wopsle great aunt collected her energies and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch rod
after receiving the charge with every mark of derision the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand
the book had an alphabet in it some figures and table and a little spelling that is to say it had had once
as soon as this volume began to circulate mr_wopsle great aunt fell into a state of coma arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm
the pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of boots with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes
this mental exercise lasted until biddy made a rush at them and distributed three defaced bibles shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature i have since met with speckled all over with ironmould and having various specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves
when the fights were over biddy gave out the number of a page and then we all read aloud what we could or what we couldn t
this part of the course was usually lightened by several single combats between biddy and refractory students in a frightful chorus
biddy leading with a high shrill monotonous voice and none of us having the least notion of or reverence for what we were reading about
when this horrible din had lasted a certain time it mechanically awoke mr_wopsle great aunt who staggered at a boy fortuitously and pulled his ears
this was understood to terminate the course for the evening and we emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory
it is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupil entertaining himself with a slate or even with the ink when there was any but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holden and which was also mr_wopsle great aunt sitting room and bedchamber being but faintly illuminated through the agency of one low spirited dip candle and no snuffers
it appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon under these circumstance nevertheless i resolved to try it and that very evening biddy entered on our special agreement by imparting some information from her little catalogue of prices under the head of moist sugar and lending me to copy at home a large old english which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper and which i supposed until she told me what it was to be a design for a buckle
i had received strict orders from my sister to call for him at the three jolly_bargemen that evening on my way from school and bring him home at my peril
of course there was a public house in the village and of course mrs_joe_gargery liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there to the three jolly_bargemen therefore i directed my steps
there was a bar at the jolly_bargemen with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door which seemed to me to be never paid off
but there was a quantity of chalk about our country and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account
it being saturday night i found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records but as my business was with mrs_joe_gargery and not with him i merely wished him good evening and passed into the common room at the end of the passage where there was a bright large kitchen fire and where mrs_joe_gargery was smoking his pipe in company with mr_wopsle and a stranger
mrs_joe_gargery greeted me as usual with halloa mr_pip old chap and the moment he said that the stranger turned his head and looked at me
they had been there ever since i could remember and had grown more than i had he was a secret looking man whom i had never seen before
his head was all on one side and one of his eye was half shut up as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun
he had a pipe in his mouth and he took it out and after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time nodded
so i nodded and then he nodded again and made room on the settle beside him that i might sit down there
but as i was used to sit beside mrs_joe_gargery whenever i entered that place of resort i said no thank you sir and fell into the space mrs_joe_gargery made for me on the opposite settle
the strange man after glancing at mrs_joe_gargery and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged nodded to me again when i had taken my seat and then rubbed his leg in a very odd way as it struck me
you was saying said the strange man turning to mrs_joe_gargery that you was a blacksmith yes i said it you know said mrs_joe_gargery
what ll you drink mr you didnt mention your name by the bye mrs_joe_gargery mentioned it now and the strange man called him by it
well said mrs_joe_gargery to tell you the truth i aint much in the habit of drinking at anybody expense but my own
what ll you drink mr mrs_joe_gargery at my expense to top up with habit no returned the stranger but once and away and on a saturday night too
come put a name to it mr mrs_joe_gargery i wouldnt wish to be stiff company said mrs_joe_gargery rum rum repeated the stranger
and will the other gentleman originate a sentiment rum said mr_wopsle three rums cried the stranger calling to the landlord
this other gentleman observed mrs_joe_gargery by way of introducing mr_wopsle is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out
glasses round our clerk at church aha said the stranger quickly and cocking his eye at me the lonely church right out on the marsh with graves round it
the stranger with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe put his leg up on the settle that he had to himself
he wore a flapping broad brimmed traveller hat and under it a handkerchief tied over his head in the manner of a cap so that he showed no hair
as he looked at the fire i thought i saw a cunning expression followed by a half laugh come into his face
that it said mrs_joe_gargery i am not acquainted with this country gentleman but it seems a solitary country towards the river
most marsh is solitary said mrs_joe_gargery no doubt no doubt do you find any gypsies now or tramps or vagrants of any sort out there
no said mrs_joe_gargery none but a runaway convict now and then and we dont find them easy eh mr_wopsle
mr_wopsle with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture assented but not warmly seems you have been out after such
not that we wanted to take them you understand we went out as lookers on me and mr_wopsle and mr_pip
the stranger looked at me again still cocking his eye as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun and said he a likely young parcel of bones that
asked the stranger once returned mrs_joe_gargery didnt us mr_pip yes mrs_joe_gargery what is it you call him
mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery christened mr_pip no not christened mr_pip surname mr_pip no said mrs_joe_gargery it a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant and is called by
well said mrs_joe_gargery meditatively not of course that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it but because it was the way at the jolly_bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes well no
well said mrs_joe_gargery with the same appearance of profound cogitation he is not no not to deceive you he is not my nevvy
son of yours no he aint nevvy said the strange man what the blue blazes is he
mr_wopsle struck in upon that as one who knew all about relationships having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not marry and expounded the ties between me and mrs_joe_gargery
having his hand in mr_wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from richard the third and seemed to think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added as the poet says
and here i may remark that when mr_wopsle referred to me he considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eye
i cannot conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstance
yet i do not call to mind that i was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle but some large handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronize me
all this while the strange man looked at nobody but me and looked at me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last and bring me down
but he said nothing after offering his blue blazes observation until the glasses of rum and water were brought and then he made his shot and a most extraordinary shot it was
asked the stranger which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength it was not a verbal remark but a proceeding in dumb show and was pointedly addressed to me
and he stirred it and he tasted it not with a spoon that was brought to him but with a file
he stirred his rum and water pointedly at me and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me he did this so that nobody
but i saw the file and when he had done it he wiped the file and put it in a breast pocket
i knew it to be mrs_joe_gargery file and i knew that he knew my convict the moment i saw the instrument
i sat gazing at him spell bound but he now reclined on his settle taking very little notice of me and talking principally about turnips
there was a delicious sense of cleaning up and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh in our village on saturday night which stimulated mrs_joe_gargery to dare to stay out half an hour longer on saturdays than at other time
the half hour and the rum and water running out together mrs_joe_gargery got up to go and took me by the hand
i think i ve got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket and if i have the boy shall have it
he looked it out from a handful of small change folded it in some crumpled paper and gave it to me
stop half a moment mr mrs_joe_gargery said the strange man yours said he mind your own i thanked him staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manner and holding tight to mrs_joe_gargery
he gave mrs_joe_gargery good night and he gave mr_wopsle good night who went out with us and he gave me only a look with his aiming eye no not a look for he shut it up but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it
on the way home if i had been in a humor for talking the talk must have been all on my side for mr_wopsle parted from us at the door of the jolly_bargemen and mrs_joe_gargery went all the way home with his mouth wide open to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible
but i was in a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance and could think of nothing else
my sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen and mrs_joe_gargery was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her about the bright shilling
a bad un i ll be bound said mrs_joe_gargery triumphantly or he wouldnt have given it to the boy let look at it
i took it out of the paper and it proved to be a good one but what this said mrs_joe_gargery throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper
nothing less than two fat sweltering one pound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle markets in the county
two one pound notes mrs_joe_gargery caught up his hat again and ran with them to the jolly_bargemen to restore them to their owner
while he was gone i sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there
presently mrs_joe_gargery came back saying that the man was gone but that he mrs_joe_gargery had left word at the three jolly_bargemen concerning the notes
then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper and put them under some dried rose leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state parlor
i had sadly broken sleep when i got to bed through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convict a feature in my low career that i had previously forgotten
there they remained a nightmare to me many and many a night and day i was haunted by the file too
i coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of miss_havisham next wednesday and in my sleep i saw the file coming at me out of a door without seeing who held it and i screamed myself awake
a dread possessed me that when i least expected it the file would reappear chapter xi at the appointed time i returned to miss_havisham and my hesitating ring at the gate brought out miss_estella
she locked it after admitting me as she had done before and again preceded me into the dark passage where her candle stood
she took no notice of me until she had the candle in her hand when she looked over her shoulder superciliously saying you are to come this way to day and took me to quite another part of the house
we traversed but one side of the square however and at the end of it she stopped and put her candle down and opened a door
here the daylight reappeared and i found myself in a small paved courtyard the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwelling house that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery
the passage was a long one and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the manor house there was a clock in the outer wall of this house
we went in at the door which stood open and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling on the ground floor at the back
there was some company in the room and miss_estella said to me as she joined it you are to go and stand there boy till you are wanted
like the clock in miss_havisham room and like miss_havisham watch it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine there being the window i crossed to it and stood there in a very uncomfortable state of mind looking out
it opened to the ground and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden upon a rank ruin of cabbage stalks and one box tree that had been clipped round long ago like a pudding and had a new growth at the top of it out of shape and of a different color as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt
there had been some light snow overnight and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge but it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window as if it pelted me for coming there
this was my homely thought as i contemplated the box tree i divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room and that its other occupants were looking at me
i could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the window glass but i stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that i was under close inspection
before i had been standing at the window five minutes they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs because the admission that he or she did know it would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug
they all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody pleasure and the most talkative of the lady had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn
this lady whose name was mrs_camilla very much reminded me of my sister with the difference that she was older and as i found when i caught sight of her of a blunter cast of features
there were three lady in the room and one gentleman indeed when i knew her better i began to think it was a mercy
she had any features at all so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face poor dear soul said this lady with an abruptness of manner quite my sister
nobody enemy but his own it would be much more commendable to be somebody else enemy said the gentleman far more natural
cousin raymond observed another lady we are to love our neighbor miss_sarah_pocket returned cousin raymond if a man is not his own neighbor who is
miss pocket laughed and mrs_camilla laughed and said checking a yawn the idea but i thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too
mrs_camilla presently went on i knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time he is so very strange
would anyone believe that when tom wife died he actually could not be induced to see the importance of the child having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning
the other lady who had not spoken yet said gravely and emphatically very true poor soul good lord says he mrs_camilla what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little thing are in black
good point in him good point in him said cousin raymond heaven forbid i should deny good point in him but he never had and he never will have any sense of the proprieties
so like mr_matthew_pocket the idea you know i was obliged said mrs_camilla i was obliged to be firm i said it will not do for the credit of the family
i told him that without deep trimmings the family was disgraced i cried about it from breakfast till dinner i injured my digestion
thank goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that i instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the thing
and at last he flung out in his violent way and said with a then do as you like
he paid for them did he not asked miss_estella it not the question my dear child who paid for them returned mrs_camilla
i bought them and i shall often think of that with peace when i wake up in the night
the ringing of a distant bell combined with the echoing of some cry or call along the passage by which i had come interrupted the conversation and caused miss_estella to say to me now boy
on my turning round they all looked at me with the utmost contempt and as i went out i heard miss_sarah_pocket say well i am sure
as we were going with our candle along the dark passage miss_estella stopped all of a sudden and facing round said in her taunting manner with her face quite close to mine
what next and mrs_camilla add with indignation was there ever such a fancy the i de a well well miss i answered almost falling over her and checking myself
she stood looking at me and of course i stood looking at her am i pretty yes i think you are very pretty
am i insulting not so much so as you were last time said i not so much so
she fired when she asked the last question and she slapped my face with such force as she had when i answered it
no now said she you little coarse monster what do you think of me now i shall not tell you
because you are going to tell upstairs is that it no said i that not it why dont you cry again you little wretch
because i ll never cry for you again said i which was i suppose as false a declaration as ever was made for i was inwardly crying for her then and i know what i know of the pain she cost me afterwards
we went on our way upstairs after this episode and as we were going up we met a gentleman groping his way down
whom have we here asked the gentleman stopping and looking at me a boy said miss_estella he was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion with an exceedingly large head and a corresponding large hand
he took my chin in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the candle
he was prematurely bald on the top of his head and had bushy black eyebrows that wouldnt lie down but stood up bristling
he had a large watch chain and strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them
he was nothing to me and i could have had no foresight then that he ever would be anything to me but it happened that i had this opportunity of observing him well
his eye were set very deep in his head and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious boy of the neighborhood hey said he
yes sir said i how do you come here miss_havisham sent for me sir i explained well behave yourself
i have a pretty large experience of boy and you re a bad set of fellow now mind said he biting the side of his great forefinger as he frowned at me you behave yourself
with those word he released me which i was glad of for his hand smelt of scented soap and went his way downstairs
i wondered whether he could be a doctor but no i thought he couldnt be a doctor or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner
there was not much time to consider the subject for we were soon in miss_havisham room where she and everything else were just as i had left them
miss_estella left me standing near the door and i stood there until miss_havisham cast her eye upon me from the dressing table
so she said without being startled or surprised the day have worn away have they yes ma am
to day is there there there with the impatient movement of her finger i dont want to know are you ready to play
i was obliged to answer in some confusion i dont think i am ma am not at cards again
since this house strikes you old and grave boy said miss_havisham impatiently and you are unwilling to play are you willing to work
i could answer this inquiry with a better heart than i had been able to find for the other question and i said i was quite willing
then go into that opposite room said she pointing at the door behind me with her withered hand and wait there till i come
she demanded with a searching look yes ma am i could do that if i was wanted
i crossed the staircase landing and entered the room she indicated from that room too the daylight was completely excluded and it had an airless smell that was oppressive
a fire had been lately kindled in the damp old fashioned grate and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer air like our own marsh mist
certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimney piece faintly lighted the chamber or it would be more expressive to say faintly troubled its darkness
it was spacious and i dare say had once been handsome but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould and dropping to pieces
the most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together
an epergne or centre piece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable and as i looked along the yellow expanse out of which i remember its seeming to grow like a black fungus i saw speckle legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it and running out from it as if some circumstance of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community
but the black beetles took no notice of the agitation and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way as if they were short sighted and hard of hearing and not on terms with one another
these crawling thing had fascinated my attention and i was watching them from a distance when miss_havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder
in her other hand she had a crutch headed stick on which she leaned and she looked like the witch of the place
this said she pointing to the long table with her stick is where i will be laid when i am dead
i heard the mice too rattling behind the panels as if the same occurrence were important to their interests they shall come and look at me here
with some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there and die at once the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork at the fair i shrank under her touch
what do you think that is she asked me again pointing with her stick that where those cobwebs are
she looked all round the room in a glaring manner and then said leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder come come come
i cant guess what it is ma am it a great cake a bride cake mine walk me walk me
i made out from this that the work i had to do was to walk miss_havisham round and round the room
accordingly i started at once and she leaned upon my shoulder and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation founded on my first impulse under that roof of mr_pumblechook chaise cart
still we went at an impatient fitful speed and as we went she twitched the hand upon my shoulder and worked her mouth and led me to believe that we were going fast because her thought went fast
she was not physically strong and after a little time said slower after a while she said call miss_estella so i went out on the landing and roared that name as i had done on the previous occasion
if only miss_estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings i should have felt sufficiently discontented but as she brought with her the three lady and the gentleman whom i had seen below i didnt know what to do
in my politeness i would have stopped but miss_havisham twitched my shoulder and we posted on with a shame faced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing
when her light appeared i returned to miss_havisham and we started away again round and round the room dear miss_havisham said miss_sarah_pocket
mrs_camilla brightened when miss pocket met with this rebuff and she murmured as she plaintively contemplated miss_havisham poor dear soul
how well you look i do not returned miss_havisham i am yellow skin and bone certainly not to be expected to look well poor thing
as we were close to mrs_camilla then i would have stopped as a matter of course only miss_havisham wouldnt stop
the idea and how are you said miss_havisham to mrs_camilla we swept on and i felt that i was highly obnoxious to mrs_camilla
thank you miss_havisham she returned i am as well as can be expected why what the matter with you asked miss_havisham with exceeding sharpness
i dont wish to make a display of my feelings but i have habitually thought of you more in the night than i am quite equal to
very easily said remarked mrs_camilla amiably repressing a sob while a hitch came into her upper lip and her tears overflowed
nothing worth mentioning replied mrs_camilla then dont think of me retorted miss_havisham raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile i am obliged to take in the night
raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings i have in my leg chokings and nervous jerkings however are nothing new to me when i think with anxiety of those i love
if i could be less affectionate and sensitive i should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves i am sure i wish it could be so
but as to not thinking of you in the night the idea here a burst of tears the raymond referred to i understood to be the gentleman present and him i understood to be mr mrs_camilla
he came to the rescue at this point and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice mrs_camilla my dear it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your leg shorter than the other
i am not aware observed the grave lady whose voice i had heard but once that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person my dear
miss_sarah_pocket whom i now saw to be a little dry brown corrugated old woman with a small face that might have been made of walnut shells and a large mouth like a cat without the whiskers supported this position by saying no indeed my dear
hem thinking is easy enough said the grave lady what is easier you know assented miss_sarah_pocket
oh yes yes cried mrs_camilla whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from her leg to her bosom it all very true
no doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise still i wouldnt change my disposition if i could
it the cause of much suffering but it a consolation to know i posses it when i wake up in the night
miss_havisham and i had never stopped all this time but kept going round and round the room now brushing against the skirts of the visitors now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber
it a weakness to be so affectionate but i cant help it here another burst of feeling there mr_matthew_pocket said mrs_camilla
i have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut and have lain there hour insensible with my head over the side and my hair all down and my foot
never mixing with any natural ties never coming here to see how miss_havisham is i dont know where much higher than your head my love said mr mrs_camilla
i have gone off into that state hour and hour on account of mr_matthew_pocket strange and inexplicable conduct and nobody has thanked me
you see my dear added miss_sarah_pocket a blandly vicious personage the question to put to yourself is who did you expect to thank you my love
without expecting any thanks or anything of the sort resumed mrs_camilla i have remained in that state hour and hour and raymond is a witness of the extent to which i have choked and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been and i have been heard at the piano forte tuner across the street where the poor mistaken child have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance and now to be told
here mrs_camilla put her hand to her throat and began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there
really i must say i should think not interposed the grave lady when this same mr_matthew_pocket was mentioned miss_havisham stopped me and herself and stood looking at the speaker
this change had a great influence in bringing mrs_camilla chemistry to a sudden end mr_matthew_pocket will come and see me at last said miss_havisham sternly when i am laid on that table
that will be his place there striking the table with her stick at my head and yours will be there and your husband there
and miss_sarah_pocket there and miss_georgiana there now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me
and now go at the mention of each name she had struck the table with her stick in a new place
she now said walk me walk me and we went on again i suppose there nothing to be done exclaimed mrs_camilla but comply and depart
it something to have seen the object of one love and duty for even so short a time i shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when i wake up in the night
i am determined not to make a display of my feelings but it very hard to be told one wants to feast on one relations as if one was a giant and to be told to go
mr mrs_camilla interposing as mrs_camilla laid her hand upon her heaving bosom that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which i supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view and kissing her hand to miss_havisham was escorted forth
miss_sarah_pocket and miss_georgiana contended who should remain last but miss_sarah_pocket was too knowing to be outdone and ambled round miss_georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence
miss_sarah_pocket then made her separate effect of departing with bless you miss_havisham dear and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest
while miss_estella was away lighting them down miss_havisham still walked with her hand on my shoulder but more and more slowly
i wish mr_matthew_pocket could have that comfort but he sets it at defiance the bare idea at last she stopped before the fire and said after muttering and looking at it some seconds
this is my birthday mr_pip i was going to wish her many happy returns when she lifted her stick
i dont suffer it to be spoken of i dont suffer those who were here just now or any one to speak of it
they come here on the day but they dare not refer to it of course i made no further effort to refer to it
on this day of the year long before you were born this heap of decay stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table but not touching it was brought here
it and i have worn away together the mice have gnawed at it and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me
she held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking at the table she in her once white dress all yellow and withered the once white cloth all yellow and withered everything around in a state to crumble under a touch
when the ruin is complete said she with a ghastly look and when they lay me dead in my bride dress on the bride table which shall be done and which will be the finished curse upon him so much the better if it is done on this day
she stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure lying there i remained quiet
in the heavy air of the room and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corner i even had an alarming fancy that miss_estella and i might presently begin to decay
at length not coming out of her distraught state by degrees but in an instant miss_havisham said let me see you two play cards why have you not begun
with that we returned to her room and sat down as before i was beggared as before and again as before miss_havisham watched us all the time directed my attention to miss_estella beauty and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on miss_estella breast and hair
miss_estella returned and she too remained quiet it seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time miss_estella for her part likewise treated me as before except that she did not condescend to speak
when we had played some half dozen games a day was appointed for my return and i was taken down into the yard to be fed in the former dog like manner
it is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which i had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was on that last occasion open or shut
there too i was again left to wander about as i liked enough that i saw no gate then and that i saw one now
as it stood open and as i knew that miss_estella had let the visitors out for she had returned with the keys in her hand i strolled into the garden and strolled all over it
it was quite a wilderness and there were old melon frames and cucumber frames in it which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan
when i had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallen down grape vine and some bottles i found myself in the dismal corner upon which i had looked out of the window
never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty i looked in at another window and found myself to my great surprise exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair
he had been at his book when i had found myself staring at him and i now saw that he was inky
this pale young gentleman quickly disappeared and reappeared beside me halloa said he young fellow halloa being a general observation which i had usually observed to be best answered by itself i said halloa
politely omitting young fellow who let you in said he miss_estella who gave you leave to prowl about
miss_estella come and fight said the pale young gentleman what could i do but follow him i have often asked myself the question since but what else could i do
his manner was so final and i was so astonished that i followed where he led as if i had been under a spell
stop a minute though he said wheeling round before we had gone many paces i ought to give you a reason for fighting too
in a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hand against one another daintily flung one of his leg up behind him pulled my hair slapped his hand again dipped his head and butted it into my stomach
the bull like proceeding last mentioned besides that it was unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat
there it is i therefore hit out at him and was going to hit out again when he said aha would you and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience
laws of the game said he here he skipped from his left leg on to his right regular rules
here he skipped from his right leg on to his left come to the ground and go through the preliminaries
i was secretly afraid of him when i saw him so dexterous but i felt morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have had no business in the pit of my stomach and that i had a right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention
therefore i followed him without a word to a retired nook of the garden formed by the junction of two wall and screened by some rubbish
here he dodged backwards and forwards and did all sorts of thing while i looked helplessly at him on his asking me if i was satisfied with the ground and on my replying
yes he begged my leave to absent himself for a moment and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar
and then fell to pulling off not only his jacket and waistcoat but his shirt too in a manner at once light hearted business like and bloodthirsty
available for both he said placing these against the wall although he did not look very healthy having pimples on his face and a breaking out at his mouth these dreadful preparations quite appalled me
i judged him to be about my own age but he was much taller and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance
for the rest he was a young gentleman in a gray suit when not denuded for battle with his elbows knees wrists and heels considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development
my heart failed me when i saw him squaring at me with every demonstration of mechanical nicety and eyeing my anatomy as if he were minutely choosing his bone
i never have been so surprised in my life as i was when i let out the first blow and saw him lying on his back looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly fore shortened
the second greatest surprise i have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again looking up at me out of a black eye
but he was on his foot directly and after sponging himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again his spirit inspired me with great respect
he seemed to have no strength and he never once hit me hard and he was always knocked down but he would be up again in a moment sponging himself or drinking out of the water bottle with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last
he got heavily bruised for i am sorry to record that the more i hit him the harder i hit him but he came up again and again and again until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall
even after that crisis in our affairs he got up and turned round and round confusedly a few time not knowing where i was but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up at the same time panting out
he seemed so brave and innocent that although i had not proposed the contest i felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory
indeed i go so far as to hope that i regarded myself while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or other wild beast
that means you have won however i got dressed darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals and i said can i help you
and he said no thankee and i said good afternoon and he said same to you when i got into the courtyard i found miss_estella waiting with the keys
but she neither asked me where i had been nor why i had kept her waiting and there was a bright flush upon her face as though something had happened to delight her
instead of going straight to the gate too she stepped back into the passage and beckoned me come here you may kiss me if you like
i kissed her cheek as she turned it to me i think i would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek
but i felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been and that it was worth nothing
what with the birthday visitors and what with the cards and what with the fight my stay had lasted so long that when i neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marsh was gleaming against a black night sky and mrs_joe_gargery furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road
the more i thought of the fight and recalled the pale young gentleman on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance the more certain it appeared that something would be done to me
chapter xii my mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman i felt that the pale young gentleman blood was on my head and that the law would avenge it
without having any definite idea of the penalties i had incurred it was clear to me that village boy could not go stalking about the country ravaging the house of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of england without laying themselves open to severe punishment
for some day i even kept close at home and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand lest the officers of the county jail should pounce upon me
the pale young gentleman nose had stained my trousers and i tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night
i had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman teeth and i twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles as i devised incredible way of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when i should be haled before the judges
when the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence my terrors reached their height
whether myrmidons of justice specially sent down from london would be lying in ambush behind the gate whether miss_havisham preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her house might rise in those grave clothes of hers draw a pistol and shoot me dead whether suborned boy a numerous band of mercenaries might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery and cuff me until i was no more it was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman that i never imagined him accessory to these retaliations they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features
however go to miss_havisham i must and go i did and behold nothing came of the late struggle it was not alluded to in any way and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises
i found the same gate open and i explored the garden and even looked in at the window of the detached house but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within and all was lifeless
only in the corner where the combat had taken place could i detect any evidence of the young gentleman existence there were traces of his gore in that spot and i covered them with garden mould from the eye of man
on the broad landing between miss_havisham own room and that other room in which the long table was laid out i saw a garden chair a light chair on wheels that you pushed from behind
it had been placed there since my last visit and i entered that same day on a regular occupation of pushing miss_havisham in this chair when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder round her own room and across the landing and round the other room
over and over and over again we would make these journeys and sometimes they would last as long as three hour at a stretch
i insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous because it was at once settled that i should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes and because i am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months
as we began to be more used to one another miss_havisham talked more to me and asked me such question as what had i learnt and what was i going to be
i told her i was going to be apprenticed to mrs_joe_gargery i believed and i enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end
neither did she ever give me any money or anything but my daily dinner nor ever stipulate that i should be paid for my services
but she did not on the contrary she seemed to prefer my being ignorant miss_estella was always about and always let me in and out but never told me
sometimes she would coldly tolerate me sometimes she would condescend to me sometimes she would be quite familiar with me sometimes she would tell me energetically that she hated me
miss_havisham would often ask me in a whisper or when we were alone does she grow prettier and prettier mr_pip
also when we played at cards miss_havisham would look on with a miserly relish of miss_estella moods whatever they were
and sometimes when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that i was puzzled what to say or do miss_havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness murmuring something in her ear that sounded like break their heart my pride and hope break their heart and have no mercy
i might kiss her again and when i said yes for indeed she did would seem to enjoy it greedily there was a song mrs_joe_gargery used to hum fragments of at the forge of which the burden was old clem
this was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a patron saint but i believe old clem stood in that relation towards smiths
it was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of old clem respected name
thus you were to hammer boy round old clem with a thump and a sound old clem beat it out beat it out old clem
one day soon after the appearance of the chair miss_havisham suddenly saying to me with the impatient movement of her finger there there there
with a clink for the stout old clem blow the fire blow the fire old clem roaring dryer soaring higher old clem sing
it happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep
after that it became customary with us to have it as we moved about and miss_estella would often join in though the whole strain was so subdued even when there were three of us that it made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind
i was surprised into crooning this ditty as i pushed her over the floor what could i become with these surroundings
is it to be wondered at if my thought were dazed as my eye were when i came out into the natural light from the misty yellow room
perhaps i might have told mrs_joe_gargery about the pale young gentleman if i had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which i had confessed
under the circumstance i felt that mrs_joe_gargery could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach therefore i said nothing of him
besides that shrinking from having miss_havisham and miss_estella discussed which had come upon me in the beginning grew much more potent as time went on
how could my character fail to be influenced by them i reposed complete confidence in no one but biddy but i told poor biddy everything
why it came natural to me to do so and why biddy had a deep concern in everything i told her i did not know then though i think i know now
that ass mr_pumblechook used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with my sister and i really do believe to this hour with less penitence than i ought to feel that if these hand could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise cart they would have done it
the miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before him as it were to operate upon and
he would drag me up from my stool usually by the collar where i was quiet in a corner and putting me before the fire as if i were going to be cooked would begin by saying now mum here is this boy
meanwhile councils went on in the kitchen at home fraught with almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit here is this boy which you brought up by hand
hold up your head boy and be forever grateful unto them which so did do now mum with respections to this boy
and then he would rumple my hair the wrong way which from my earliest remembrance as already hinted i have in my soul denied the right of any fellow creature to do and would hold me before him by the sleeve a spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself
then he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about miss_havisham and about what she would do with me and for me that i used to want quite painfully to burst into spiteful tears fly at mr_pumblechook and pummel him all over
in these dialogues my sister spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every reference while mr_pumblechook himself self constituted my patron would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye like the architect of my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job
but he was often talked at while they were in progress by reason of mrs_joe_gargery perceiving that he was not favorable to my being taken from the forge
i was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to mrs_joe_gargery and when mrs_joe_gargery sat with the poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part that she would dive at him take the poker out of his hand shake him and put it away
all in a moment with nothing to lead up to it my sister would stop herself in a yawn and catching sight of me as it were incidentally would swoop upon me with come
in these discussions mrs_joe_gargery bore no part there was a most irritating end to every one of these debates there enough of you
you get along to bed you ve given trouble enough for one night i hope as if i had besought them as a favor to bother my life out
we went on in this way for a long time and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time when one day miss_havisham stopped short as she and i were walking she leaning on my shoulder and said with some displeasure
i thought it best to hint through the medium of a meditative look that this might be occasioned by circumstance over which i had no control
she said no more at the time but she presently stopped and looked at me again and presently again and after that looked frowning and moody
on the next day of my attendance when our usual exercise was over and i had landed her at her dressing table she stayed me with a movement of her impatient finger
you are growing tall mr_pip tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours mrs_joe_gargery ma am meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to
yes miss_havisham you had better be apprenticed at once would mrs_joe_gargery come here with you and bring your indentures do you think
i signified that i had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be asked then let him come
at any particular time miss_havisham there there i know nothing about time let him come soon and come along with you
when i got home at night and delivered this message for mrs_joe_gargery my sister went on the rampage in a more alarming degree than at any previous period
she asked me and mrs_joe_gargery whether we supposed she was door mats under our foot and how we dared to use her so and what company we graciously thought she was fit for
when she had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries she threw a candlestick at mrs_joe_gargery burst into a loud sobbing got out the dustpan which was always a very bad sign put on her coarse apron and began cleaning up to a terrible extent
not satisfied with a dry cleaning she took to a pail and scrubbing brush and cleaned us out of house and home so that we stood shivering in the back yard
it was ten clock at night before we ventured to creep in again and then she asked mrs_joe_gargery why he hadnt married a negress slave at once
mrs_joe_gargery offered no answer poor fellow but stood feeling his whisker and looking dejectedly at me as if he thought it really might have been a better speculation
chapter xiii it was a trial to my feelings on the next day but one to see mrs_joe_gargery arraying himself in his sunday clothes to accompany me to miss_havisham
however as he thought his court suit necessary to the occasion it was not for me to tell him that he looked far better in his working dress the rather because i knew he made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable entirely on my account and that it was for me he pulled up his shirt collar so very high behind that it made the hair on the crown of his head
at breakfast time my sister declared her intention of going to town with us and being left at uncle mr_pumblechook and called for when we had done with our fine lady a way of putting the case from which mrs_joe_gargery appeared inclined to augur the worst
the forge was shut up for the day and mrs_joe_gargery inscribed in chalk upon the door as it was his custom to do on the very rare occasion when he was not at work the monosyllable hout accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he had taken
we walked to town my sister leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet and carrying a basket like the great seal of england in plaited straw a pair of pattens a spare shawl and an umbrella though it was a fine bright day
i am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously but i rather think they were displayed as articles of property much as cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or procession
stand up like a tuft of feathers when we came to mr_pumblechook my sister bounced in and left us as it was almost noon mrs_joe_gargery and i held straight on to miss_havisham house
miss_estella opened the gate as usual and the moment she appeared mrs_joe_gargery took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hand as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce
miss_estella took no notice of either of us but led us the way that i knew so well i followed next to her and mrs_joe_gargery came last
when i looked back at mrs_joe_gargery in the long passage he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes
miss_estella told me we were both to go in so i took mrs_joe_gargery by the coat cuff and conducted him into miss_havisham presence
she was seated at her dressing table and looked round at us immediately oh said she to mrs_joe_gargery you are the husband of the sister of this boy
like some extraordinary bird standing as he did speechless with his tuft of feathers ruffled and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm
i could hardly have imagined dear old mrs_joe_gargery looking so unlike himself or so you are the husband repeated miss_havisham of the sister of this boy
which i meantersay mr_pip mrs_joe_gargery now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation strict confidence and great politeness as i hup and married your sister and i were at the time what you might call if you was anyways inclined a single man
it was very aggravating but throughout the interview mrs_joe_gargery persisted in addressing me instead of miss_havisham well said miss_havisham
and you have reared the boy with the intention of taking him for your apprentice is that so mr mrs_joe_gargery
you know mr_pip replied mrs_joe_gargery as you and me were ever friend and it were looked for ard to betwixt us as being calc lated to lead to larks
but what mr_pip if you had ever made objections to the business such as its being open to black and sut or
not such like not but what they would have been attended to dont you see has the boy said miss_havisham ever made any objection
which it is well beknown to yourself mr_pip returned mrs_joe_gargery strengthening his former mixture of argumentation confidence and politeness that it were the wish of your own hart
i saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion before he went on to say
does he like the trade and there werent no objection on your part and mr_pip it were the great wish of your hart
it was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he ought to speak to miss_havisham
the more i made face and gestures to him to do it the more confidential argumentative and polite he persisted in being to me
well mr_pip you know replied mrs_joe_gargery as if that were a little unreasonable you yourself see me put em in my at and therefore you know as they are here
have you brought his indentures with you asked miss_havisham with which he took them out and gave them not to miss_havisham but to me
i am afraid i was ashamed of the dear good fellow i know i was ashamed of him when i saw that miss_estella stood at the back of miss_havisham chair and that her eye laughed mischievously
i took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to miss_havisham you expected said miss_havisham as she looked them over no premium with the boy
mr_pip returned mrs_joe_gargery cutting me short as if he were hurt which i meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me and which you know the answer to be full
mrs_joe_gargery i remonstrated for he made no reply at all why dont you answer well no you know it to be no mr_pip and wherefore should i say it
miss_havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was better than i had thought possible seeing what he was there and took up a little bag from the table beside her
mr_pip has earned a premium here she said and here it is there are five and twenty guineas in this bag give it to your master mr_pip
as if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room mrs_joe_gargery even at this pass persisted in addressing me
this is wery liberal on your part mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery and it is as such received and grateful welcome though never looked for far nor near nor nowheres
and now old chap said mrs_joe_gargery conveying to me a sensation first of burning and then of freezing for i felt as if that familiar expression were applied to miss
may you and me do our duty both on us by one and another and by them which your liberal present have conweyed to be for the satisfaction of mind of them as never here mrs_joe_gargery showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties until he triumphantly rescued himself with the word and from myself far be it
havisham and now old chap may we do our duty these word had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice
good bye mr_pip said miss_havisham let them out miss_estella am i to come again miss_havisham i asked
thus calling him back as i went out of the door i heard her say to mrs_joe_gargery in a distinct emphatic voice the boy has been a good boy here and that is his reward
no mrs_joe_gargery is your master now mrs_joe_gargery one word of course as an honest man you will expect no other and no more
how mrs_joe_gargery got out of the room i have never been able to determine but i know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding upstairs instead of coming down and was deaf to all remonstrances until i went after him and laid hold of him
in another minute we were outside the gate and it was locked and miss_estella was gone when we stood in the daylight alone again mrs_joe_gargery backed up against a wall and said to me astonishing
and there he remained so long saying astonishing at intervals so often that i began to think his senses were never coming back
at length he prolonged his remark into mr_pip i do assure you this is as ton ishing and so by degrees became conversational and able to walk away
i have reason to think that mrs_joe_gargery intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through and that on our way to mr_pumblechook he invented a subtle and deep design
my reason is to be found in what took place in mr_pumblechook parlor where on our presenting ourselves my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman
well cried my sister addressing us both at once and what happened to you i wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this i am sure i do
miss_havisham said mrs_joe_gargery with a fixed look at me like an effort of remembrance made it wery partick ler that we should give her were it compliments or respects mr_pip
compliments i said which that were my own belief answered mrs_joe_gargery her compliments to mrs mrs_joe_gargery much good they ll do me
and wishing pursued mrs_joe_gargery with another fixed look at me like another effort of remembrance that the state of miss_havisham elth were sitch as would have allowed were it mr_pip
observed my sister but rather gratified too of her having the pleasure i added of lady company said mrs_joe_gargery
and drew a long breath well cried my sister with a mollified glance at mr_pumblechook she might have had the politeness to send that message at first but it better late than never
and what did she give young rantipole here she giv him said mrs_joe_gargery nothing mrs_joe_gargery was going to break out but mrs_joe_gargery went on
what she giv said mrs_joe_gargery she giv to his friend and by his friend were her explanation i mean into the hand of his sister mrs mrs_joe_gargery
them were her word mrs mrs_joe_gargery she maynt have know added mrs_joe_gargery with an appearance of reflection whether it were mrs_joe_gargery or jorge
my sister looked at mr_pumblechook who smoothed the elbows of his wooden arm chair and nodded at her and at the fire as if he had known all about it beforehand
and how much have you got asked my sister laughing positively laughing what would present company say to ten pound demanded mrs_joe_gargery
they say returned my sister curtly pretty well not too much but pretty well it more than that then said mrs_joe_gargery
that fearful impostor mr_pumblechook immediately nodded and said as he rubbed the arm of his chair it more than that mum
why you dont mean to say began my sister yes i do mum said mr_pumblechook but wait a bit go on joseph_gargery
good in you go on what would present company say proceeded mrs_joe_gargery to twenty pound handsome would be the word returned my sister
well then said mrs_joe_gargery it more than twenty pound that abject hypocrite mr_pumblechook nodded again and said with a patronizing laugh it more than that mum
good again follow her up joseph_gargery then to make an end of it said mrs_joe_gargery delightedly handing the bag to my sister it five and twenty pound
it five and twenty pound mum echoed that basest of swindlers mr_pumblechook rising to shake hand with her and it no more than your merits as i said when my opinion was asked and i wish you joy of the money
if the villain had stopped here his case would have been sufficiently awful but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind
now you see joseph_gargery and wife said mr_pumblechook as he took me by the arm above the elbow i am one of them that always go right through with what they ve begun
this boy must be bound out of hand that my way bound out of hand goodness knows uncle mr_pumblechook said my sister grasping the money we re deeply beholden to you
never mind me mum returned that diabolical cornchandler a pleasure a pleasure all the world over but this boy you know we must have him bound
the justices were sitting in the town hall near at hand and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to mrs_joe_gargery in the magisterial presence
i say we went over but i was pushed over by mr_pumblechook exactly as if i had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick indeed it was the general impression in court that i had been taken red handed for
as mr_pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd i heard some people say what he done and others he a young un too but look bad dont he
one person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage shop of fetters and entitled to be read in my cell
i said i see to it to tell you the truth the hall was a queer place i thought with higher pews in it than a church and
with people hanging over the pews looking on and with mighty justices one with a powdered head leaning back in chair with folded arm or taking snuff or going to sleep or writing or reading the newspapers and with some shining black portraits on the wall which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking plaster
here in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested and i was bound mr_pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold to have those little preliminaries disposed of
when we had come out again and had got rid of the boy who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured and who were much disappointed to find that my friend were merely rallying round me we went back to mr_pumblechook
and there my sister became so excited by the twenty five guineas that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the blue_boar and that mr_pumblechook must go over in his chaise cart and bring the hubbles and mr_wopsle
for it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason in the mind of the whole company that i was an excrescence on the entertainment
and to make it worse they all asked me from time to time in short whenever they had nothing else to do why
it was agreed to be done and a most melancholy day i passed i didnt enjoy myself and what could i possibly do then but say i was enjoying myself when
that swindling mr_pumblechook exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion actually took the top of the table and when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if i played at cards drank strong liquors kept late hour or bad company or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable he placed me standing on a chair beside him to illustrate his remarks
my only other remembrances of the great festival are that they wouldnt let me go to sleep but whenever they saw me dropping off woke me up and told me to enjoy myself
that rather late in the evening mr_wopsle gave us collins ode and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down with such effect that a waiter came in and said the commercials underneath sent up their compliments and it wasnt the tumblers arm
i wasnt however they were grown up and had their own way and they made the most of it that they were all in excellent spirits on the road home and sang lady fair
mr_wopsle taking the bass and asserting with a tremendously strong voice in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner by wanting to know all about everybody private affairs that he was the man with his white locks flowing and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going
finally i remember that when i got into my little bedroom i was truly wretched and had a strong conviction on me that i should never like mrs_joe_gargery trade
i had liked it once but once was not now chapter xiv it is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home
there may be black ingratitude in the thing and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved but that it is a miserable thing i can testify
home had never been a very pleasant place to me because of my sister temper but mrs_joe_gargery had sanctified it and i had believed in it
i had believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon i had believed in the front door as a mysterious portal of the temple of state whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls i had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment i had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence
now it was all coarse and common and i would not have had miss_havisham and miss_estella see it on any account
how much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault how much miss_havisham how much my sister is now of no moment to me or to any one
within a single year all this was changed the change was made in me the thing was done well or ill done excusably or inexcusably it was done
once it had seemed to me that when i should at last roll up my shirt sleeves and go into the forge mrs_joe_gargery prentice i should be distinguished and happy
now the reality was in my hold i only felt that i was dusty with the dust of small coal and that i had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather
there have been occasion in my later life i suppose as in most life when i have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more
never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to mrs_joe_gargery
i remember that at a later period of my time i used to stand about the churchyard on sunday evening when night was falling comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea
i was quite as dejected on the first working day of my apprenticeship as in that after time but i am glad to know that i never breathed a murmur to mrs_joe_gargery while my indentures lasted
it is about the only thing i am glad to know of myself in that connection for though it includes what i proceed to add all the merit of what i proceed to add was mrs_joe_gargery
it was not because i was faithful but because mrs_joe_gargery was faithful that i never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor
it was not because i had a strong sense of the virtue of industry but because mrs_joe_gargery had a strong sense of the virtue of industry that i worked with tolerable zeal against the grain
it is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honest hearted duty doing man flies out into the world but it is very possible to know how it has touched one self in going by and i know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented mrs_joe_gargery and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me
what i dreaded was that in some unlucky hour i being at my grimiest and commonest should lift up my eye and see miss_estella looking in at one of the wooden window of the forge
i was haunted by the fear that she would sooner or later find me out with a black face and hand doing the coarsest part of my work and would exult over me and despise me
often after dark when i was pulling the bellows for mrs_joe_gargery and we were singing old clem and when the thought how we used to sing it at miss_havisham would seem to show me miss_estella face in the fire with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eye scorning me often at such a time i would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden window then were and would fancy that i saw her just drawing her face away and would believe that she had come at last
after that when we went into supper the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever and i would feel more ashamed of home than ever in my own ungracious breast
what i wanted who can say how can i say when i never knew chapter xv as i was getting too big for mr_wopsle great aunt room my education under that preposterous female terminated
not however until biddy had imparted to me everything she knew from the little catalogue of prices to a comic song she had once bought for a half penny
although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines when i went to lunnon town sir too rul loo rul
in my desire to be wiser i got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity nor do i recollect that i questioned its merit except that i thought as i still do the amount of too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry
in my hunger for information i made proposals to mr_wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me with which he kindly complied
as it turned out however that he only wanted me for a dramatic lay figure to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of way i soon declined that course of instruction though not until mr_wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me
too rul loo rul wasnt i done very brown sir too rul loo rul too rul loo rul still whatever i acquired i tried to impart to mrs_joe_gargery
i wanted to make mrs_joe_gargery less ignorant and common that he might be worthier of my society and less open to miss_estella reproach
the old battery out on the marsh was our place of study and a broken slate and a short piece of slate pencil were our educational implements to which mrs_joe_gargery always added a pipe of tobacco
i never knew mrs_joe_gargery to remember anything from one sunday to another or to acquire under my tuition any piece of information whatever
yet he would smoke his pipe at the battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else even with a learned air as if he considered himself to be advancing immensely
this statement sounds so well that i cannot in my conscience let it pass unexplained dear fellow i hope he did
it was pleasant and quiet out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork and sometimes when the tide was low looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water
whenever i watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread i somehow thought of miss_havisham and miss_estella and whenever the light struck aslant afar off upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water line it was just the same miss_havisham and miss_estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque
one sunday when mrs_joe_gargery greatly enjoying his pipe had so plumed himself on being most awful dull that i had given him up for the day i lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand descrying traces of miss_havisham and miss_estella all over the prospect in the sky and in the water until at last i resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head
mrs_joe_gargery said i dont you think i ought to make miss_havisham a visit well mr_pip returned mrs_joe_gargery slowly considering
what for what for mrs_joe_gargery what is any visit made for there is some wisits r aps said mrs_joe_gargery as for ever remains open to the question mr_pip
but in regard to wisiting miss_havisham she might think you wanted something expected something of her dont you think i might say that i did not mrs_joe_gargery
mrs_joe_gargery felt as i did that he had made a point there and he pulled hard at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition
you see mr_pip mrs_joe_gargery pursued as soon as he was past that danger miss_havisham done the handsome thing by you
when miss_havisham done the handsome thing by you she called me back to say to me as that were all
you might old chap said mrs_joe_gargery and she might credit it similarly she mightnt yes mrs_joe_gargery i heard her
all mrs_joe_gargery repeated very emphatically yes mrs_joe_gargery i tell you i heard her which i meantersay mr_pip it might be that her meaning were make
i had thought of that too and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it for it seemed to render it more probable
a end on it as you was me to the north and you to the south keep in sunders but mrs_joe_gargery
here am i getting on in the first year of my time and since the day of my being bound i have never thanked miss_havisham or asked after her or shown that i remember her
that true mr_pip and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes all four round and which i meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present in a total wacancy of hoofs
yes old chap i dont mean that sort of remembrance mrs_joe_gargery i dont mean a present
but mrs_joe_gargery had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it or even said he
if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain for the front door or say a gross or two of shark headed screws for general use or some light fancy article such as a toasting fork when she took her muffins or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such like i dont mean any present at all mrs_joe_gargery i interposed
well said mrs_joe_gargery still harping on it as though i had particularly pressed it if i was yourself mr_pip i wouldnt
no i would not for what a door chain when she got one always up and shark headers is open to misrepresentations and if it was a toasting fork you go into brass and do yourself no credit
a gridiron is a gridiron said mrs_joe_gargery steadfastly impressing it upon me as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion and you may haim at what you like but a gridiron it will come out either by your leave or again your leave and you cant help yourself
and the oncommonest workman cant show himself oncommon in a gridiron for my dear mrs_joe_gargery i cried in desperation taking hold of his coat dont go on in that way
i never thought of making miss_havisham any present no mr_pip mrs_joe_gargery assented as if he had been contending for that all along and
yes mrs_joe_gargery but what i wanted to say was that as we are rather slack just now if you would give me a half holiday to morrow i think i would go uptown and make a call on miss est havisham
what i say to you is you are right mr_pip which her name said mrs_joe_gargery gravely aint estavisham mr_pip unless she have been rechris ened
i know mrs_joe_gargery i know it was a slip of mine what do you think of it mrs_joe_gargery in brief mrs_joe_gargery thought that if i thought well of it he thought well of it
but he was particular in stipulating that if i were not received with cordiality or if i were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favor received then this experimental trip should have no successor
by these conditions i promised to abide now mrs_joe_gargery kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was old_orlick he pretended that his christian name was dolge a clear impossibility but
he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that i believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding
he never even seemed to come to his work on purpose but would slouch in as if by mere accident and when he went to the jolly_bargemen to eat his dinner or went away at night he would slouch out like cain or the wandering jew as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back
he lodged at a sluice keeper out on the marsh and on working day would come slouching from his hermitage with his hand in his pocket and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back
he was a broadshouldered loose limbed swarthy fellow of great strength never in a hurry and always slouching on sundays he mostly lay all day on the sluice gate or stood against ricks and barns
he always slouched locomotively with his eye on the ground and when accosted or otherwise required to raise them he looked up in a half resentful half puzzled way as though the only thought he ever had was that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking
when i was very small and timid he gave me to understand that the devil lived in a black corner of the forge and that he knew the fiend very well also that it was necessary to make up the fire once in seven year with a live boy and that i might consider myself fuel
when i became mrs_joe_gargery prentice old_orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that i should displace him howbeit he liked me still less
not that he ever said anything or did anything openly importing hostility i only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction and that whenever i sang old clem he came in out of time
this morose journeyman had no liking for me dolge old_orlick was at work and present next day when i reminded mrs_joe_gargery of my half holiday
he said nothing at the moment for he and mrs_joe_gargery had just got a piece of hot iron between them and i was at the bellows but by and by he said leaning on his hammer
now master sure you re not a going to favor only one of us if young mr_pip has a half holiday do as much for old_orlick
i suppose he was about five and twenty but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person why what ll you do with a half holiday if you get it said mrs_joe_gargery
what ll i do with it what ll he do with it i ll do as much with it as him said old_orlick
as to mr_pip he going up town said mrs_joe_gargery well then as to old_orlick he a going up town retorted that worthy
two can go up town taint only one wot can go up town dont lose your temper said mrs_joe_gargery
shall if i like growled old_orlick some and their uptowning now master come no favoring in this shop be a man
the master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper old_orlick plunged at the furnace drew out a red hot bar made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body whisked it round my head laid it on the anvil hammered it out as if it were i_
i thought and the sparks were my spirting blood and finally said when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold and he again leaned on his hammer
now master are you all right now demanded mrs_joe_gargery ah i am all right said gruff old_orlick
then as in general you stick to your work as well as most man said mrs_joe_gargery let it be a half holiday for all
my sister had been standing silent in the yard within hearing she was a most unscrupulous spy and listener and she instantly looked in at one of the window
like you you fool said she to mrs_joe_gargery giving holidays to great idle hulkers like that you are a rich man upon my life to waste wages in that way
i wish i was his master you be everybody master if you durst retorted old_orlick with an ill favored grin let her alone said mrs_joe_gargery
i be a match for all noodles and all rogues returned my sister beginning to work herself into a mighty rage
and i couldnt be a match for the noodles without being a match for your master who the dunder headed king of the noodles
and i couldnt be a match for the rogues without being a match for you who are the blackest looking and the worst rogue between this and france
now you re a foul shrew mother mrs_joe_gargery growled the journeyman if that makes a judge of rogues you ought to be a good un
let her alone will you said mrs_joe_gargery what did you say cried my sister beginning to scream what did you say
what did that fellow old_orlick say to me mr_pip what did he call me with my husband standing by oh oh
what is equally true of all the violent woman i have ever seen that passion was no excuse for her because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion she consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself into it and became blindly furious by regular stages what was the name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me
oh each of these exclamations was a shriek and i must remark of my sister oh hold me oh ah h growled the journeyman between his teeth
i hold you if you was my wife i hold you under the pump and choke it out of you
i tell you let her alone said mrs_joe_gargery oh to hear him cried my sister with a clap of her hand and a scream
together which was her next stage to hear the name he giving me that old_orlick in my own house me a married woman
here my sister after a fit of clappings and screamings beat her hand upon her bosom and upon her knees and threw her cap off and pulled her hair down which were the last stages on her road to frenzy
being by this time a perfect fury and a complete success she made a dash at the door which i had fortunately locked
what could the wretched mrs_joe_gargery do now after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions but stand up to his journeyman and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and mrs_joe_gargery and further whether he was man enough to come on
old_orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on and was on his defence straightway so without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons they went at one another like two giants
with my husband standing by oh oh but if any man in that neighborhood could stand uplong against mrs_joe_gargery i never saw the man
old_orlick as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman was very soon among the coal dust and in no hurry to come out of it
then mrs_joe_gargery unlocked the door and picked up my sister who had dropped insensible at the window but who had seen the fight first i think and who was carried into the house and laid down and who was recommended to revive and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hand in mrs_joe_gargery hair
then came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars and then with the vague sensation which i have always connected with such a lull namely that it was sunday and somebody was dead i went upstairs to dress myself
when i came down again i found mrs_joe_gargery and old_orlick sweeping up without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of old_orlick nostrils which was neither expressive nor ornamental
a pot of beer had appeared from the jolly_bargemen and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner
the lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on mrs_joe_gargery who followed me out into the road to say as a parting observation that might do me good on the rampage mr_pip and off the rampage mr_pip such is life
with what absurd emotions for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy
i found myself again going to miss_havisham matters little here nor how i passed and repassed the gate many time before i could make up my mind to ring
nor how i debated whether i should go away without ringing nor how i should undoubtedly have gone if my time had been my own to come back
miss_sarah_pocket came to the gate no miss_estella how then you here again said miss pocket what do you want
when i said that i only came to see how miss_havisham was miss_sarah_pocket evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business
but unwilling to hazard the responsibility she let me in and presently brought the sharp message that i was to come up
everything was unchanged and miss_havisham was alone well said she fixing her eye upon me i hope you want nothing
i only wanted you to know that i am doing very well in my apprenticeship and am always much obliged to you
you ll get nothing no indeed miss_havisham there there with the old restless finger come now and then come on your birthday ay
she cried suddenly turning herself and her chair towards me you are looking round for miss_estella hey i had been looking round in fact for miss_estella and i stammered that i hoped she was well
abroad said miss_havisham educating for a lady far out of reach prettier than ever admired by all who see her
there was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last word and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh that i was at a loss what to say
when the gate was closed upon me by miss_sarah_pocket of the walnut shell countenance i felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything and that was all i took by that motion
as i was loitering along the high street looking in disconsolately at the shop window and thinking what i would buy if i were a gentleman who should come out of the bookshop but mr_wopsle
mr_wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of george barnwell in which he had that moment invested sixpence with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of mr_pumblechook with whom he was going to drink tea
no sooner did he see me than he appeared to consider that a special providence had put a prentice in his way to be read at and he laid hold of me and insisted on my accompanying him to the pumblechookian parlor
as i knew it would be miserable at home and as the night were dark and the way was dreary and almost any companionship on the road was better than none i made no great resistance consequently we turned into mr_pumblechook just as the street and the shops were lighting up
as i never assisted at any other representation of george barnwell i dont know how long it may usually take but i know very well that it took until half past nine clock that night and that when mr_wopsle got into newgate i thought he never would go to the scaffold he became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career
i thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all as if he had not been running to seed leaf after leaf ever since his course began
do you feel that you have lost her she spared me the trouble of considering by dismissing me this however was a mere question of length and wearisomeness
when barnwell began to go wrong i declare that i felt positively apologetic mr_pumblechook indignant stare so taxed me with it
what stung me was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self mr_wopsle too took pains to present me in the worst light
at once ferocious and maudlin i was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstance whatever millwood put me down in argument on every occasion it became sheer monomania in my master daughter to care a button for me and all i can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning is that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character
mr_pumblechook sat staring at me and shaking his head and saying take warning boy take warning as if it were a well known fact that i contemplated murdering a near relation provided i could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor
it was a very dark night when it was all over and when i set out with mr_wopsle on the walk home
even after i was happily hanged and mr_wopsle had closed the book beyond town we found a heavy mist out and it fell wet and thick
the turnpike lamp was a blur quite out of the lamp usual place apparently and its rays looked solid substance on the fog
we were noticing this and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marsh when we came upon a man slouching under the lee of the turnpike house
halloa we said stopping old_orlick there ah he answered slouching out i was standing by a minute on the chance of company
you are late i remarked old_orlick not unnaturally answered well and you re late we have been said mr_wopsle exalted with his late performance we have been indulging mr old_orlick in an intellectual evening
old_orlick growled as if he had nothing to say about that and we all went on together i asked him presently whether he had been spending his half holiday up and down town
yes said he all of it i come in behind yourself i didnt see you but i must have been pretty close behind you
by the by the guns is going again at the hulks said i ay there some of the birds flown from the cages
in effect we had not walked many yards further when the well remembered boom came towards us deadened by the mist and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives
the guns have been going since dark about you ll hear one presently a good night for cutting off in said old_orlick
we be puzzled how to bring down a jail bird on the wing to night the subject was a suggestive one to me and i thought about it in silence
mr_wopsle as the ill requited uncle of the evening tragedy fell to meditating aloud in his garden at camberwell old_orlick with his hand in his pocket slouched heavily at my side
now and then the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river
it was very dark very wet very muddy and so we splashed along i kept myself to myself and my thought
mr_wopsle died amiably at camberwell and exceedingly game on bosworth field and in the greatest agonies at glastonbury old_orlick sometimes growled beat it out beat it out old clem
with a clink for the stout old clem i thought he had been drinking but he was not drunk thus we came to the village
the way by which we approached it took us past the three jolly_bargemen which we were surprised to find it being eleven clock in a state of commotion with the door wide open and unwonted light that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about
mr_wopsle dropped into ask what was the matter surmising that a convict had been taken but came running out in a great hurry
there something wrong said he without stopping up at your place mr_pip run all what is it i asked keeping up with him
so did old_orlick at my side i cant quite understand the house seems to have been violently entered when mrs_joe_gargery was out
we were running too fast to admit of more being said and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen
it was full of people the whole village was there or in the yard and there was a surgeon and there was mrs_joe_gargery and there were a group of woman all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen
the unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me and so i became aware of my sister lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the fire destined never to be on the rampage again while she was the wife of mrs_joe_gargery
with my head full of george barnwell i was at first disposed to believe that i must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister or at all events that as her near relation popularly known to be under obligations to her i was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else
but when in the clearer light of next morning i began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all side i took another view of the case which was more reasonable
mrs_joe_gargery had been at the three jolly_bargemen smoking his pipe from a quarter after eight clock to a quarter before ten
while he was there my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door and had exchanged good night with a farm laborer going home
the man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her he got into dense confusion when he tried to be than that it must have been before nine
when mrs_joe_gargery went home at five minutes before ten he found her struck down on the floor and promptly called in assistance
the fire had not then burnt unusually low nor was the snuff of the candle very long the candle however had been blown out
supposed by convict somebody has been attacked and hurt chapter xvi nothing had been taken away from any part of the house
neither beyond the blowing out of the candle which stood on a table between the door and my sister and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struck was there any disarrangement of the kitchen excepting such as she herself had made in falling and bleeding
she had been struck with something blunt and heavy on the head and spine after the blows were dealt something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence as she lay on her face
but there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot and on the ground beside her when mrs_joe_gargery picked her up was a convict leg iron which had been filed asunder
the hue and cry going off to the hulks and people coming thence to examine the iron mrs_joe_gargery opinion was corroborated
they did not undertake to say when it had left the prison ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convict who had escaped last night
now mrs_joe_gargery examining this iron with a smith eye declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago further one of those two was already retaken and had not freed himself of his iron
i believed the iron to be my convict iron the iron i had seen and heard him filing at on the marsh but
knowing what i knew i set up an inference of my own here my mind did not accuse him of having put it to its latest use
for i believed one of two other person to have become possessed of it and to have turned it to this cruel account
now as to old_orlick he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike he had been seen about town all the evening he had been in divers company in several public house and he had come back with myself and mr_wopsle
there was nothing against him save the quarrel and my sister had quarrelled with him and with everybody else about her ten thousand time
as to the strange man if he had come back for his two bank notes there could have been no dispute about them because my sister was fully prepared to restore them
besides there had been no altercation the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly that she had been felled before she could look round
either old_orlick or the strange man who had shown me the file it was horrible to think that i had provided the weapon however undesignedly but i could hardly think otherwise
i suffered unspeakable trouble while i considered and reconsidered whether i should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell mrs_joe_gargery all the story
the contention came after all to this the secret was such an old one now had so grown into me and become a part of myself that i could not tear it away
in addition to the dread that having led up to so much mischief it would be now more likely than ever to alienate mrs_joe_gargery from me if he believed it i had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal cutlets as a monstrous invention
however i temporized with myself of course for was i not wavering between right and wrong when the thing is always done and resolved to make a full disclosure if i should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant
the constables and the bow street man from london for this happened in the day of the extinct red waistcoated police were about the house for a week or two and did pretty much what i have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such case
they took up several obviously wrong people and they ran their head very hard against wrong idea and persisted in trying to fit the circumstance to the idea instead of trying to extract idea from the circumstance
also they stood about the door of the jolly_bargemen with knowing and reserved look that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink that was almost as good as taking the culprit
for months afterwards i every day settled the question finally in the negative and reopened and reargued it next morning but not quite for they never did it
her sight was disturbed so that she saw objects multiplied and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities her hearing was greatly impaired her memory also and her speech was unintelligible
when at last she came round so far as to be helped downstairs it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech
as she was very bad handwriting apart a more than indifferent speller and as mrs_joe_gargery was a more than indifferent reader extraordinary complications arose between them which i was always called in to solve
the administration of mutton instead of medicine the substitution of tea for mrs_joe_gargery and the baker for bacon were among the mildest of my own mistakes
long after these constitutional powers had dispersed my sister lay very ill in bed however her temper was greatly improved and she was patient
a tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her regular state and afterwards at intervals of two or three months she would often put her hand to her head and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind
mr_wopsle great aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen and biddy became a part of our establishment
it may have been about a month after my sister reappearance in the kitchen when biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects and became a blessing to the household
above all she was a blessing to mrs_joe_gargery for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife and had been accustomed while attending on her of an evening to turn to me every now and then and say with his blue eye moistened such a fine figure of a woman as she once were mr_pip
biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy mrs_joe_gargery became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life and to get down to the jolly_bargemen now and then for a change that did him good
it was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor mrs_joe_gargery though he never knew it and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered
we were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us biddy first triumph in her new office was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me
again and again and again my sister had traced upon the slate a character that looked like a curioust and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted
i had tried hard at it but had made nothing of it thus it was i had in vain tried everything producible that began with at from tar to toast and tub
at length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer and on my lustily calling that word in my sister ear she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent
then i bethought me of a crutch the shape being much the same and i borrowed one in the village and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence
but she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck
thereupon i had brought in all our hammers one after another but without avail when my sister found that biddy was very quick to understand her this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate
biddy looked thoughtfully at it heard my explanation looked thoughtfully at my sister looked thoughtfully at mrs_joe_gargery who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter and ran into the forge followed by mrs_joe_gargery and me
why of course cried biddy with an exultant face dont you see it him old_orlick without a doubt she had lost his name and could only signify him by his hammer
we told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen and he slowly laid down his hammer wiped his brow with his arm took another wipe at it with his apron and came slouching out with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him
she manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced and motioned that she would have him given something to drink
she watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception she showed every possible desire to conciliate him and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did such as i have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master
after that day a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate and without old_orlick slouching in and standing doggedly before her as if he knew no more than i did what to make of it
i confess that i expected to see my sister denounce him and that i was disappointed by the different result chapter xvii
i now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marsh by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to miss_havisham
i found miss_sarah_pocket still on duty at the gate i found miss_havisham just as i had left her and she spoke of miss_estella in the very same way if not in the very same word
the interview lasted but a few minutes and she gave me a guinea when i was going and told me to come again on my next birthday
i tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily if i expected more
so unchanging was the dull old house the yellow light in the darkened room the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing table glass that i felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped time in that mysterious place and while i and everything else outside it grew older it stood still
daylight never entered the house as to my thought and remembrances of it any more than as to the actual fact
it bewildered me and under its influence i continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home
i may mention at once that this became an annual custom then and after that i took it imperceptibly i became conscious of a change in biddy however
her shoes came up at the heel her hair grew bright and neat her hand were always clean she was not beautiful she was common and could not be like
she had not been with us more than a year i remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me when i observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eye eyes that were very pretty and very good
it came of my lifting up my own eye from a task i was poring at writing some passages from a book to improve myself in two way at once by a sort of stratagem and seeing biddy observant of what i was about
miss_estella but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet tempered i laid down my pen and biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down
biddy said i how do you manage it either i am very stupid or you are very clever
she managed our whole domestic life and wonderfully too but i did not mean that though that made what i did mean more surprising
what is it that i manage i dont know returned biddy smiling how do you manage biddy said i to learn everything that i learn and always to keep up with me
i was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge for i spent my birthday guineas on it and set aside the greater part of my pocket money for similar investment though i have no doubt now that the little i knew was extremely dear at the price
no because when i come in from the forge of a night any one can see me turning to at it
i might as well ask you said biddy how you manage but you never turn to at it biddy
pursuing my idea as i leaned back in my wooden chair and looked at biddy sewing away with her head on one side i began to think her rather an extraordinary girl
for i called to mind now that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade and the name of our different sorts of work and our various tools
i suppose i must catch it like a cough said biddy quietly and went on with her sewing in short whatever i knew biddy knew
theoretically she was already as good a blacksmith as i or better you are one of those biddy said i who make the most of every chance
you never had a chance before you came here and see how improved you are biddy looked at me for an instant and went on with her sewing
i was your first teacher though wasnt i said she as she sewed biddy i exclaimed in amazement
why you are crying no i am not said biddy looking up and laughing what put that in your head
what could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work
i sat silent recalling what a drudge she had been until mr_wopsle great aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people
i recalled the hopeless circumstance by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered
i reflected that even in those untoward time there must have been latent in biddy what was now developing for in my first uneasiness and discontent i had turned to her for help as a matter of course
biddy sat quietly sewing shedding no more tears and while i looked at her and thought about it all it occurred to me that perhaps i had not been sufficiently grateful to biddy
i might have been too reserved and should have patronized her more though i did not use that precise word in my meditations with my confidence
i observed when i had done turning it over you were my first teacher and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this in this kitchen
it was like her self forgetfulness to transfer the remark to my sister and to get up and be busy about her making her more comfortable that sadly true
yes biddy ah poor thing replied biddy well said i we must talk together a little more as we used to do
and i must consult you a little more as i used to do let us have a quiet walk on the marsh next sunday biddy and a long chat
my sister was never left alone now but mrs_joe_gargery more than readily undertook the care of her on that sunday afternoon and biddy and i went out together
when we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard and were out on the marsh and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on i began to combine miss_havisham and miss_estella with the prospect in my usual way
when we came to the river side and sat down on the bank with the water rippling at our foot making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound i resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of biddy into my inner confidence
it was summer time and lovely weather biddy said i after binding her to secrecy i want to be a gentleman
i wouldnt if i was you she returned i dont think it would answer biddy said i with some severity i have particular reason for wanting to be a gentleman
you know best mr_pip but dont you think you are happier as you are biddy i exclaimed impatiently i am not at all happy as i am
i am disgusted with my calling and with my life i have never taken to either since i was bound dont be absurd
was i absurd said biddy quietly raising her eyebrows i am sorry for that i didnt mean to be i only want you to do well and to be comfortable
well then understand once for all that i never shall or can be comfortable or anything but miserable there biddy unless i can lead a very different sort of life from the life i lead now
now i too had so often thought it a pity that in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which i was always carrying on i was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own
i told her she was right and i knew it was much to be regretted but still it was not to be helped
if i could have settled down i said to biddy plucking up the short grass within reach much as i had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall if i could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as i was when i was little i know it would have been much better for me
you and i and mrs_joe_gargery would have wanted nothing then and mrs_joe_gargery and i would perhaps have gone partners when i was out of my time and i might even have grown up to keep company with you and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine sunday quite different people
that a pity said biddy shaking her head with a sorrowful air i should have been good enough for you shouldnt i biddy
biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on and returned for answer yes i am not over particular it scarcely sounded flattering but i knew she meant well
instead of that said i plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two see how i am going on
biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships
it was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say she remarked directing her eye to the ships again
dissatisfied and uncomfortable and what would it signify to me being coarse and common if nobody had told me so
it was not to be shuffled off now however and i answered the beautiful young lady at miss_havisham and she more beautiful than anybody ever was and i admire her dreadfully and i want to be a gentleman on her account
having made this lunatic confession i began to throw my torn up grass into the river as if i had some thought of following it
who said it i was disconcerted for i had broken away without quite seeing where i was going to
do you want to be a gentleman to spite her or to gain her over biddy quietly asked me after a pause
because if it is to spite her biddy pursued i should think but you know best that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her word
i dont know i moodily answered and if it is to gain her over i should think but you know best she was not worth gaining over
but how could i a poor dazed village lad avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of man fall every day
exactly what i myself had thought many time exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment it may be all quite true said i to biddy but i admire her dreadfully
in short i turned over on my face when i came to that and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head and wrenched it well
all the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced that i was quite conscious it would have served my face
right if i had lifted it up by my hair and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot
she put her hand which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work upon my hand one after another and gently took them out of my hair
biddy was the wisest of girls and she tried to reason no more with me then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way while with my face upon my sleeve
i cried a little exactly as i had done in the brewery yard and felt vaguely convinced that i was very much ill used by somebody or by everybody
i am glad of one thing said biddy and that is that you have felt you could give me your confidence mr_pip
and i am glad of another thing and that is that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it
if your first teacher dear such a poor one and so much in need of being taught herself had been your teacher at the present time she thinks she knows what lesson she would set
i cant say which but it would be a hard one to learn and you have got beyond her and
so with a quiet sigh for me biddy rose from the bank and said with a fresh and pleasant change of voice shall we walk a little farther or go home
biddy i cried getting up putting my arm round her neck and giving her a kiss i shall always tell you everything
it of no use now till you re a gentleman said biddy you know i never shall be so that always
not that i have any occasion to tell you anything for you know everything i know as i told you at home the other night
ah said biddy quite in a whisper as she looked away at the ships and then repeated with her former pleasant change shall we walk a little farther or go home
i said to biddy we would walk a little farther and we did so and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening and it was very beautiful
i began to consider whether i was not more naturally and wholesomely situated after all in these circumstance than playing beggar my neighbor by candle light in the room with the stopped clocks and being despised by miss_estella
i thought it would be very good for me if i could get her out of my head with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies and could go to work determined to relish what i had to do and stick to it and make the best of it
i asked myself the question whether i did not surely know that if miss_estella were beside me at that moment instead of biddy she would make me miserable
i was obliged to admit that i did know it for a certainty and i said to myself mr_pip what a fool you are
biddy was never insulting or capricious or biddy to day and somebody else to morrow she would have derived only pain and no pleasure from giving me pain she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine
we talked a good deal as we walked and all that biddy said seemed right how could it be then that i did not like her much the better of the two
biddy said i when we were walking homeward i wish you could put me right i wish i could said biddy
if i could only get myself to fall in love with you you dont mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance
oh dear not at all said biddy dont mind me if i could only get myself to do it that would be the thing for me
it did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hour before
but you never will you see said biddy i therefore observed i was not quite sure of that but biddy said she was and she said it decisively
in my heart i believed her to be right and yet i took it rather ill too that she should be so positive on the point
there started up from the gate or from the rushes or from the ooze which was quite in his stagnant way old_orlick
when we came near the churchyard we had to cross an embankment and get over a stile near a sluice gate halloa
he growled where are you two going where should we be going but home well then said he i jiggered if i dont see you home
he attached no definite meaning to the word that i am aware of but used it like his own pretended christian name to affront mankind and convey an idea of something savagely damaging
when i was younger i had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook
biddy was much against his going with us and said to me in a whisper dont let him come i dont like him
as i did not like him either i took the liberty of saying that we thanked him but we didnt want seeing home
he received that piece of information with a yell of laughter and dropped back but came slouching after us at a little distance
curious to know whether biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account i asked her why she did not like him
this penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of his oh she replied glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us because i i am afraid he likes me
no said biddy glancing over her shoulder again he never told me so but he dances at me whenever he can catch my eye
did he ever tell you he liked you i asked indignantly however novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment i did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation
i was very hot indeed upon old_orlick daring to admire her as hot as if it were an outrage on myself
but it makes no difference to you you know said biddy calmly no biddy it makes no difference to me only i dont like it i dont approve of it
but i must tell you i should have no opinion of you biddy if he danced at you with your own consent
i kept an eye on old_orlick after that night and whenever circumstance were favorable to his dancing at biddy got before him to obscure that demonstration
he had struck root in mrs_joe_gargery establishment by reason of my sister sudden fancy for him or i should have tried to get him dismissed
nor i neither said biddy though that makes no difference to you exactly said i he quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions as i had reason to know thereafter
i complicated its confusion fifty thousand fold by having state and seasons when i was clear that biddy was immeasurably better than miss_estella and that the plain honest working life to which i was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of but offered me sufficient means of self respect and happiness
at those time i would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old mrs_joe_gargery and the forge was gone and that i was growing up in a fair way to be partners with mrs_joe_gargery and to keep company with biddy when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the havisham day would fall upon me like a destructive missile and scatter my wits again
scattered wits take a long time picking up and often before i had got them well together they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought that perhaps after all miss_havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out
if my time had run out it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities i dare say
and now because my mind was not confused enough before it never did run out however but was brought to a premature end as i proceed to relate
there was a group assembled round the fire at the three jolly_bargemen attentive to mr_wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud
chapter xviii it was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to mrs_joe_gargery and it was a saturday night of that group i was one
a highly popular murder had been committed and mr_wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows he gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description and identified himself with every witness at the inquest
he faintly moaned i am done for as the victim and he barbarously bellowed i ll serve you out as the murderer
he gave the medical testimony in pointed imitation of our local practitioner and he piped and shook as the aged turnpike keeper who had heard blows to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness
the coroner in mr_wopsle hand became timon of athens the beadle coriolanus he enjoyed himself thoroughly and we all enjoyed ourselves and were delightfully comfortable
then and not sooner i became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me looking on
there was an expression of contempt on his face and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of face
well said the stranger to mr_wopsle when the reading was done you have settled it all to your own satisfaction i have no doubt
in this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict wilful murder everybody started and looked up as if it were the murderer
he looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically guilty of course said he out with it come sir returned mr_wopsle without having the honor of your acquaintance i do say guilty
upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur i know you do said the stranger i knew you would
do you know or do you not know that the law of england supposes every man to be innocent until he is proved proved to be guilty
i told you so but now i ll ask you a question sir mr_wopsle began to reply as an englishman myself
i come said the stranger biting his forefinger at him dont evade the question either you know it or you dont know it
he stood with his head on one side and himself on one side in a bullying interrogative manner and he threw his forefinger at mr_wopsle as it were to mark him out before biting it again
which is it to be now said he do you know it or dont you know it
certainly i know it replied mr_wopsle certainly you know it then why didnt you say so at first
now i ll ask you another question taking possession of mr_wopsle as if he had a right to him do you know that none of these witnesses have yet been cross examined
mr_wopsle was beginning i can only say when the stranger stopped him what you wont answer the question yes or no
now i ll try you again throwing his finger at him again attend to me are you aware or are you not aware that none of these witnesses have yet been cross examined
come i only want one word from you yes or no mr_wopsle hesitated and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him
come said the stranger i ll help you you dont deserve help but i ll help you look at that paper you hold in your hand
is it pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner the printed paper you have just been reading from
now turn to that paper and tell me whether it distinctly state that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence
what is it what is it repeated mr_wopsle eyeing it much at a loss undoubtedly undoubtedly i read that just now mr_wopsle pleaded
never mind what you read just now sir i dont ask you what you read just now you may read the lord prayer backwards if you like and perhaps have done it before to day
turn to the paper no no no my friend not to the top of the column you know better than that to the bottom to the bottom
we all began to think mr_wopsle full of subterfuge well have you found it here it is said mr_wopsle
now follow that passage with your eye and tell me whether it distinctly state that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence
come do you make that of it mr_wopsle answered those are not the exact word not the exact word repeated the gentleman bitterly
yes repeated the stranger looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness mr_wopsle
and now i ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who with that passage before his eye can lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced a fellow creature guilty unheard
we all began to suspect that mr_wopsle was not the man we had thought him and that he was beginning to be found out
is that the exact substance yes said mr_wopsle and that same man remember pursued the gentleman throwing his finger at mr_wopsle
heavily that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial and having thus deeply committed himself might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between our sovereign lord the king and the prisoner at the bar and would a true verdict give according to the evidence so help him god
we were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate mr_wopsle had gone too far and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time
the strange gentleman with an air of authority not to be disputed and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it left the back of the settle and came into the space between the two settles in front of the fire where he remained standing his left hand in his pocket and he biting the forefinger of his right
from information i have received said he looking round at us as we all quailed before him i have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you by name joseph_gargery or mrs_joe_gargery
which is the man here is the man said mrs_joe_gargery the strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place and mrs_joe_gargery went
the stranger did not recognize me but i recognized him as the gentleman i had met on the stairs on the occasion of my second visit to miss_havisham
i had known him the moment i saw him looking over the settle and now that i stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder i checked off again in detail his large head his dark complexion his deep set eye his bushy black eyebrows his large watch chain his strong black dots of beard and whisker and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand
you have an apprentice pursued the stranger commonly known as mr_pip is he here i am here i cried
i wish to have a private conference with you two said he when he had surveyed me at his leisure
i prefer not to anticipate my communication here you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friend afterwards i have nothing to do with that
it will take a little time perhaps we had better go to your place of residence amidst a wondering silence we three walked out of the jolly_bargemen and in a wondering silence walked home
as we neared home mrs_joe_gargery vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one went on ahead to open the front door
while going along the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me and occasionally bit the side of his finger our conference was held in the state parlor which was feebly lighted by one candle
it began with the strange gentleman sitting down at the table drawing the candle to him and looking over some entries in his pocket book
he then put up the pocket book and set the candle a little aside after peering round it into the darkness at mrs_joe_gargery and me to ascertain which was which
my name he said is mr_jaggers and i am a lawyer in london i am pretty well known i have unusual business to transact with you and i commence by explaining that it is not of my originating
if my advice had been asked i should not have been here it was not asked and you see me here
finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat he got up and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it thus having one foot on the seat of the chair and one foot on the ground
what i have to do as the confidential agent of another i do no less no more now joseph_gargery mrs_joe_gargery i am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice
you would not object to cancel his indentures at his request and for his good you would want nothing for so doing
lord forbid that i should want anything for not standing in mr_pip way said mrs_joe_gargery staring lord forbidding is pious but not to the purpose returned mr_jaggers
the question is would you want anything do you want anything the answer is returned mrs_joe_gargery sternly no
i thought mr_jaggers glanced at mrs_joe_gargery as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness but i was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise to be sure of it
very well said mr_jaggers recollect the admission you have made and dont try to go from it presently
who a going to try retorted mrs_joe_gargery i dont say anybody is do you keep a dog
yes i do keep a dog bear in mind then that brag is a good dog but holdfast is a better
bear that in mind will you repeated mr_jaggers shutting his eye and nodding his head at mrs_joe_gargery as if he were forgiving him something
now i return to this young fellow and the communication i have got to make is that he has great expectations
i am instructed to communicate to him said mr_jaggers throwing his finger at me sideways that he will come into a handsome property
further that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life and from this place and be brought up as a gentleman in a word as a young fellow of great expectations
my dream was out my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality miss_havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale
mrs_joe_gargery and i gasped and looked at one another now mr_pip pursued the lawyer i address the rest of what i have to say to you
you are to understand first that it is the request of the person from whom i take my instructions that you always bear the name of mr_pip
you will have no objection i dare say to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition but if you have any objection this is the time to mention it
my heart was beating so fast and there was such a singing in my ears that i could scarcely stammer
now you are to understand secondly mr_pip that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret until the person chooses to reveal it
i am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself
i had no objection i should think not when or where that intention may be carried out i cannot say no one can say
now you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head or any allusion or reference however distant to any individual whomsoever as the individual in all the communications you may have with me
it may be year hence if you have a suspicion in your own breast keep that suspicion in your own breast
it is not the least to the purpose what the reason of this prohibition are they may be the strongest and gravest reason or they may be mere whim
your acceptance of it and your observance of it as binding is the only remaining condition that i am charged with by the person from whom i take my instructions and for whom i am not otherwise responsible
that person is the person from whom you derive your expectations and the secret is solely held by that person and by me
again not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune but if you have any objection to it this is the time to mention it
this is not for you to inquire into the condition is laid down speak out once more i stammered with difficulty that i had no objection
though he called me mr_pip and began rather to make up to me he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion and even now he occasionally shut his eye and threw his finger at me while he spoke as much as to express that he knew all kind of thing to my disparagement if he only chose to mention them
i should think not now mr_pip i have done with stipulations we come next to mere details of arrangement
you must know that although i have used the term expectations more than once you are not endowed with expectations only
there is already lodged in my hand a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance you will please consider me your guardian
for i was going to thank him i tell you at once i am paid for my services or i shouldnt render them
it is considered that you must be better educated in accordance with your altered position and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage
oh i said i had always longed for it never mind what you have always longed for mr_pip he retorted keep to the record
if you long for it now that enough am i answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor
is that it i stammered yes that was it good now your inclinations are to be consulted i dont think that wise mind but it my trust
have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another i had never heard of any tutor but biddy and mr_wopsle great aunt so i replied in the negative
there is a certain tutor of whom i have some knowledge who i think might suit the purpose said mr_jaggers
i dont recommend him observe because i never recommend anybody the gentleman i speak of is one mr_matthew_pocket
ah i caught at the name directly miss_havisham relation the mr_matthew_pocket whom mr and mrs_camilla had spoken of
the mr_matthew_pocket whose place was to be at miss_havisham head when she lay dead in her bride dress on the bride table
you know the name said mr_jaggers looking shrewdly at me and then shutting up his eye while he waited for my answer
my answer was that i had heard of the name oh said he you have heard of the name
but the question is what do you say of it i said or tried to say that i was much obliged to him for his recommendation
no my young friend he interrupted shaking his great head very slowly recollect yourself not recollecting myself i began again that i was much obliged to him for his recommendation
no my young friend he interrupted shaking his head and frowning and smiling both at once no no no it very well done but it wont do you are too young to fix me with it
recommendation is not the word mr_pip try another correcting myself i said that i was much obliged to him for his mention of mr_matthew_pocket
that more like it cried mr_jaggers and i added i would gladly try that gentleman good you had better try him in his own house
the way shall be prepared for you and you can see his son first who is in london when will you come to london
i said glancing at mrs_joe_gargery who stood looking on motionless that i supposed i could come directly first said mr_jaggers you should have some new clothes to come in and they should not be working clothes
he produced a long purse with the greatest coolness and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me
say this day week you ll want some money shall i leave you twenty guineas this was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair
he sat astride of the chair when he had pushed the money over and sat swinging his purse and eyeing mrs_joe_gargery
well joseph_gargery mrs_joe_gargery you look dumbfoundered i am said mrs_joe_gargery in a very decided manner it was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself remember
but what said mr_jaggers swinging his purse what if it was in my instructions to make you a present as compensation
it were understood said mrs_joe_gargery and it are understood and it ever will be similar according
as compensation what for mrs_joe_gargery demanded for the loss of his services mrs_joe_gargery laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman
i have often thought him since like the steam hammer that can crush a man or pat an egg shell in his combination of strength with gentleness
mr_pip is that hearty welcome said mrs_joe_gargery to go free with his services to honor and fortun as no word can tell him
but if you think as money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child what come to the forge and ever the best of friend
dear good mrs_joe_gargery whom i was so ready to leave and so unthankful to i see you again with your muscular blacksmith arm before your eye and your broad chest heaving and your voice dying away
o dear good faithful tender mrs_joe_gargery i feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel wing
but i encouraged mrs_joe_gargery at the time i was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes and could not retrace the by paths we had trodden together
i begged mrs_joe_gargery to be comforted for as he said we had ever been the best of friend and as i said we ever would be so
mrs_joe_gargery scooped his eye with his disengaged wrist as if he were bent on gouging himself but said not another word
mr_jaggers had looked on at this as one who recognized in mrs_joe_gargery the village idiot and in me his keeper
when it was over he said weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing now joseph_gargery mrs_joe_gargery i warn you this is your last chance
if you mean to take a present that i have it in charge to make you speak out and you shall have it
here to his great amazement he was stopped by mrs_joe_gargery suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose
no half measures with me if on the contrary you mean to say which i meantersay cried mrs_joe_gargery that if you come into my place bull baiting and badgering me come out
which i meantersay as sech if you re a man come on which i meantersay that what i say i meantersay and stand or fall by
i drew mrs_joe_gargery away and he immediately became placable merely stating to me in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern that he were not a going to be bull baited and badgered in his own place
mr_jaggers had risen when mrs_joe_gargery demonstrated and had backed near the door without evincing any inclination to come in again he there delivered his valedictory remarks
they were these well mr_pip i think the sooner you leave here as you are to be a gentleman the better
let it stand for this day week and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime you can take a hackney coach at the stage coach office in london and come straight to me
understand that i express no opinion one way or other on the trust i undertake i am paid for undertaking it and i do so
he was throwing his finger at both of us and i think would have gone on but for his seeming to think mrs_joe_gargery dangerous and going off
something came into my head which induced me to run after him as he was going down to the jolly_bargemen where he had left a hired carriage
now understand that finally understand that i beg your pardon mr_jaggers halloa said he facing round what the matter
i wish to be quite right mr_jaggers and to keep to your directions so i thought i had better ask
would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one i know about here before i go away
no said he looking as if he hardly understood me i dont mean in the village only but up town
i thanked him and ran home again and there i found that mrs_joe_gargery had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlor and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee gazing intently at the burning coals
no said he no objection i too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals and nothing was said for a long time
my sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner and biddy sat at her needle work before the fire and mrs_joe_gargery sat next biddy and i sat next mrs_joe_gargery in the corner opposite my sister
the more i looked into the glowing coals the more incapable i became of looking at mrs_joe_gargery the longer the silence lasted the more unable i felt to speak
no mr_pip returned mrs_joe_gargery still looking at the fire and holding his knees tight as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere which i left it to yourself mr_pip
at length i got out mrs_joe_gargery have you told biddy i would rather you told mrs_joe_gargery mr_pip a gentleman of fortun then said mrs_joe_gargery and god bless him in it
biddy dropped her work and looked at me mrs_joe_gargery held his knees and looked at me i looked at both of them
after a pause they both heartily congratulated me but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that i rather resented
i took it upon myself to impress biddy and through biddy mrs_joe_gargery with the grave obligation i considered my friend under to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune
it would all come out in good time i observed and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said save that i had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron
biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again and said she would be very particular and mrs_joe_gargery still detaining his knees said ay ay i ll be ekervally partickler mr_pip and then they congratulated me again and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that i didnt half like it
infinite pains were then taken by biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened to the best of my belief those efforts entirely failed
she laughed and nodded her head a great many time and even repeated after biddy the word mr_pip and property
but i doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry and i cannot suggest a darker picture of her state of mind
i never could have believed it without experience but as mrs_joe_gargery and biddy became more at their cheerful ease again i became quite gloomy
dissatisfied with my fortune of course i could not be but it is possible that i may have been without quite knowing it dissatisfied with myself
any how i sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand looking into the fire as those two talked about my going away and about what they should do without me and all that
and whenever i caught one of them looking at me though never so pleasantly and they often looked at me particularly biddy i felt offended as if they were expressing some mistrust of me
at those time i would get up and look out at the door for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night and stood open on summer evening to air the room
the very stars to which i then raised my eye i am afraid i took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which i had passed my life
though heaven knows they never did by word or sign saturday night said i when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese and beer
five more day and then the day before the day they ll soon go yes mr_pip observed mrs_joe_gargery whose voice sounded hollow in his beer mug
i have been thinking mrs_joe_gargery that when i go down town on monday and order my new clothes i shall tell the tailor that i ll come and put them on there or that i ll have them sent to mr_pumblechook
they ll soon go soon soon go said biddy it would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here
mr and mrs_hubble might like to see you in your new gen teel figure too mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery industriously cutting his bread with his cheese on it in the palm of his left hand and glancing at my untasted supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices
so might mr_wopsle and the jolly_bargemen might take it as a compliment that just what i dont want mrs_joe_gargery
they would make such a business of it such a coarse and common business that i couldnt bear myself ah that indeed mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery
if you couldnt abear yourself biddy asked me here as she sat holding my sister plate have you thought about when you ll show yourself to mr mrs_joe_gargery and your sister and me
you will show yourself to us wont you biddy i returned with some resentment you are so exceedingly quick that it difficult to keep up with you
if you had waited another moment biddy you would have heard me say that i shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening most likely on the evening before i go away
she always were quick observed mrs_joe_gargery biddy said no more handsomely forgiving her i soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and mrs_joe_gargery and went up to bed
when i got into my little room i sat down and took a long look at it as a mean little room that i should soon be parted from and raised above for ever
it was furnished with fresh young remembrances too and even at the same moment i fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better room to which i was going as i had been in so often between the forge and miss_havisham and biddy and miss_estella
as i put the window open and stood looking out i saw mrs_joe_gargery come slowly forth at the dark door below and take a turn or two in the air and then i saw biddy come and bring him a pipe and light it for him
he never smoked so late and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting for some reason or other
he presently stood at the door immediately beneath me smoking his pipe and biddy stood there too quietly talking to him and i knew that they talked of me for i heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once
i would not have listened for more if i could have heard more so i drew away from the window and sat down in my one chair by the bedside feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest i had ever known
looking towards the open window i saw light wreaths from mrs_joe_gargery pipe floating there and i fancied it was like a blessing from mrs_joe_gargery not obtruded on me or paraded before me but pervading the air we shared together
i put my light out and crept into bed and it was an uneasy bed now and i never slept the old sound sleep in it any more
chapter xix morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of life and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same
what lay heaviest on my mind was the consideration that six day intervened between me and the day of departure for i could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to london in the meanwhile and that when i got there it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone
mrs_joe_gargery and biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when i spoke of our approaching separation but they only referred to it when i did
after breakfast mrs_joe_gargery brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlor and we put them in the fire and i felt that i was free
with all the novelty of my emancipation on me i went to church with mrs_joe_gargery and thought perhaps the clergyman wouldnt have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of heaven if he had known all
after our early dinner i strolled out alone purposing to finish off the marsh at once and get them done with
as i passed the church i felt as i had felt during service in the morning a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there sunday after sunday all their life through and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds
i promised myself that i would do something for them one of these day and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast beef and plum pudding a pint of ale and a gallon of condescension upon everybody in the village
if i had often thought before with something allied to shame of my companionship with the fugitive whom i had once seen limping among those graves what were my thought on this sunday when the place recalled the wretch ragged and shivering with his felon iron and badge
my comfort was that it happened a long time ago and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off and that he was dead to me and might be veritably dead into the bargain
the sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic and the room was warm no more low wet grounds no more dikes and sluices no more of these grazing cattle though
they seemed in their dull manner to wear a more respectful air now and to face round in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations farewell monotonous acquaintances of my childhood henceforth i was for london and greatness not for smith work in general and for you
i made my exultant way to the old battery and lying down there to consider the question whether miss_havisham intended me for miss_estella fell asleep
when i awoke i was much surprised to find mrs_joe_gargery sitting beside me smoking his pipe he greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eye and said
as being the last time mr_pip i thought i foller and mrs_joe_gargery i am very glad you did so thankee mr_pip
you may be sure dear mrs_joe_gargery i went on after we had shaken hand that i shall never forget you no no mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery in a comfortable tone i sure of that
ay ay old chap bless you it were only necessary to get it well round in a man mind to be certain on it
but it took a bit of time to get it well round the change come so oncommon plump didnt it
i should have liked him to have betrayed emotion or to have said it does you credit mr_pip or something of that sort
therefore i made no remark on mrs_joe_gargery first head merely saying as to his second that the tidings had indeed come suddenly but that i had always wanted to be a gentleman and had often and often speculated on what i would do if i were one
somehow i was not best pleased with mrs_joe_gargery being so mightily secure of me have you though said mrs_joe_gargery astonishing
it a pity now mrs_joe_gargery said i that you did not get on a little more when we had our lessons here isnt it
it were always a pity as i was so awful dull but it no more of a pity now than it was this day twelvemonth dont you see
well i dont know returned mrs_joe_gargery i so awful dull i only master of my own trade
what i had meant was that when i came into my property and was able to do something for mrs_joe_gargery it would have been much more agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station
so when we had walked home and had had tea i took biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane and after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits that i should never forget her said i had a favor to ask of her
he was so perfectly innocent of my meaning however that i thought i would mention it to biddy in preference
and it is biddy said i that you will not omit any opportunity of helping mrs_joe_gargery on a little how helping him on
asked biddy with a steady sort of glance well mrs_joe_gargery is a dear good fellow in fact i think he is the dearest fellow that ever lived but he is rather backward in some thing
although i was looking at biddy as i spoke and although she opened her eye very wide when i had spoken she did not look at me
for instance biddy in his learning and his manner his manner wont his manner do then asked biddy plucking a black currant leaf
my dear biddy they do very well here they do very well here interrupted biddy looking closely at the leaf in her hand
out but if i were to remove mrs_joe_gargery into a higher sphere as i shall hope to remove him when i fully come into my property they would hardly do him justice
it was such a very provoking question for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me that i said
hear me and dont you think he knows that asked biddy snappishly biddy what do you mean biddy having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her
the smell of a black currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane said have you never considered that he may be proud
o there are many kind of pride said biddy looking full at me and shaking her head pride is not all of one kind
hand and proud i repeated with disdainful emphasis well what are you stopping for said i not all of one kind resumed biddy
he may be too proud to let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill and fills well and with respect
to tell you the truth i think he is though it sounds bold in me to say so for you must know him far better than i do
now biddy said i i am very sorry to see this in you i did not expect to see this in you
you are envious biddy and grudging you are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune and you cant help showing it
if you have the heart to think so returned biddy say so say so over and over again if you have the heart to think so
if you have the heart to be so you mean biddy said i in a virtuous and superior tone dont put it off upon me
i did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after i was gone of improving dear mrs_joe_gargery
i am very sorry to see it and it a it a bad side of human nature but after this i ask you nothing
i am extremely sorry to see this in you biddy i repeated it a it a bad side of human nature
whether you scold me or approve of me returned poor biddy you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power here at all time
and whatever opinion you take away of me shall make no difference in my remembrance of you yet a gentleman should not be unjust neither said biddy turning away her head
i again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature in which sentiment waiving its application i have since seen reason to think i was right and i walked down the little path away from biddy and biddy went into the house and i went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper time again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this the second night of my bright fortunes should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first
putting on the best clothes i had i went into town as early as i could hope to find the shops open and presented myself before mr_trabb the tailor who was having his breakfast in the parlor behind his shop and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me but called me into him
but morning once more brightened my view and i extended my clemency to biddy and we dropped the subject well said mr_trabb in a hail fellow well met kind of way
mr_trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather bed and was slipping butter in between the blankets and covering it up
he was a prosperous old bachelor and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace and i did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags
mr_trabb said i it an unpleasant thing to have to mention because it look like boasting but i have come into a handsome property
he forgot the butter in bed got up from the bedside and wiped his finger on the tablecloth exclaiming lord bless my soul
i am going up to my guardian in london said i casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them and i want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in
how are you and what can i do for you a change passed over mr_trabb i wish to pay for them i added otherwise i thought he might only pretend to make them with ready money
my dear sir said mr_trabb as he respectfully bent his body opened his arm and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow dont hurt me by mentioning that
may i venture to congratulate you would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop mr_trabb boy was the most audacious boy in all that country side
he was still sweeping when i came out into the shop with mr_trabb and he knocked the broom against all possible corner and obstacles to express as i understood it equality with any blacksmith alive or dead
hold that noise said mr_trabb with the greatest sternness or i ll knock your head off do me the favor to be seated sir
now this said mr_trabb taking down a roll of cloth and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss is a very sweet article
when i had entered he was sweeping the shop and he had sweetened his labors by sweeping over me i can recommend it for your purpose sir because it really is extra super
to the boy and with a dreadfully severe stare foreseeing the danger of that miscreant brushing me with it or making some other sign of familiarity
mr_trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again
but you shall see some others give me number four you then he commanded him to bring number five and number eight
and let me have none of your tricks here said mr_trabb or you shall repent it you young scoundrel the longest day you have to live
mr_trabb then bent over number four and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry an article that it would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellow townsman if he might claim me for a fellow townsman having worn
are you bringing numbers five and eight you vagabond said mr_trabb to the boy after that or shall i kick you out of the shop and bring them myself
i selected the materials for a suit with the assistance of mr_trabb judgment and re entered the parlor to be measured
for although mr_trabb had my measure already and had previously been quite contented with it he said apologetically that it wouldnt do under existing circumstance sir wouldnt do at all
so mr_trabb measured and calculated me in the parlor as if i were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor and gave himself such a world of trouble that i felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains
when he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to mr_pumblechook on the thursday evening he said with his hand upon the parlor lock i know sir that london gentleman cannot be expected to patronize local work as a rule but if you would give me a turn now and then in the quality of a townsman i should greatly esteem it
good morning sir much obliged door the last word was flung at the boy who had not the least notion what it meant
but i saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hand and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was that it had morally laid upon his back mr_trabb boy
after this memorable event i went to the hatter and the bootmaker and the hosier and felt rather like mother hubbard dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades
it was not necessary to explain everywhere that i had come into a handsome property but whenever i said anything to that effect it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the high street and concentrated his mind upon me
when i had ordered everything i wanted i directed my steps towards mr_pumblechook and as i approached that gentleman place of business i saw him standing at his door
i also went to the coach office and took my place for seven clock on saturday morning he was waiting for me with great impatience
he had prepared a collation for me in the barnwell parlor and he too ordered his shopman to come out of the gangway as my sacred person passed
my dear friend said mr_pumblechook taking me by both hand when he and i and the collation were alone i give you joy of your good fortune
he had been out early with the chaise cart and had called at the forge and heard the news well deserved well deserved
to think said mr_pumblechook after snorting admiration at me for some moment that i should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this is a proud reward
this was coming to the point and i thought it a sensible way of expressing himself i begged mr_pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted on that point
my dear young friend said mr_pumblechook if you will allow me to call you so i murmured certainly and mr_pumblechook took me by both hand again and communicated a movement to his waistcoat which had an emotional appearance though it was rather low down my dear young friend rely upon my doing my little all in your absence by keeping the fact before the mind of joseph_gargery joseph
said mr_pumblechook in the way of a compassionate adjuration joseph_gargery joseph thereupon he shook his head and tapped it expressing his sense of deficiency in joseph_gargery
here is a chicken had round from the boar here is a tongue had round from the boar here one or two little thing had round from the boar
but my dear young friend said mr_pumblechook you must be hungry you must be exhausted be seated that i hope you may not despise
but do i said mr_pumblechook getting up again the moment after he had sat down see afore me him as i ever sported with in his time of happy infancy
and may i may i this may i meant might he shake hand i consented and he was fervent and then sat down again
here is wine said mr_pumblechook let us drink thanks to fortune and may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment
and yet i cannot said mr_pumblechook getting up again see afore me one and likewise drink to one without again expressing may i may i_
i said he might and he shook hand with me again and emptied his glass and turned it upside down
i did the same and if i had turned myself upside down before drinking the wine could not have gone more direct to my head
mr_pumblechook helped me to the liver wing and to the best slice of tongue none of those out of the way no thoroughfares of pork now and took comparatively speaking no care of himself at all
you little thought said mr_pumblechook apostrophizing the fowl in the dish when you was a young fledgling what was in store for you
ah poultry poultry you little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof for one as call it a weakness if you will said mr_pumblechook getting up again but may i may i_
it began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might so he did it at once how he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife i dont know
and your sister he resumed after a little steady eating which had the honor of bringing you up by hand
it a sad picter to reflect that she no longer equal to fully understanding the honor may i saw he was about to come at me again and i stopped him
we ll drink her health said i ah cried mr_pumblechook leaning back in his chair quite flaccid with admiration that the way you know em sir
i dont know who sir was but he certainly was not i and there was no third person present that the way you know
it might said the servile mr_pumblechook putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again to a common person have the appearance of repeating but may i_
the noble minded sir ever forgiving and ever affable when he had done it he resumed his seat and drank to my sister
let us never be blind said mr_pumblechook to her faults of temper but it is to be hoped she meant well
at about this time i began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face as to myself i felt all face steeped in wine and smarting
i mentioned to mr_pumblechook that i wished to have my new clothes sent to his house and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him
i mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village and he lauded it to the skies there was nobody but himself he intimated worthy of my confidence and in short might he
then he asked me tenderly if i remembered our boyish games at sums and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice and in effect how he had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend
if i had taken ten time as many glasses of wine as i had i should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me and should in my heart of heart have repudiated the idea
yet for all that i remember feeling convinced that i had been much mistaken in him and that he was a sensible practical good hearted prime fellow
by degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs
he mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises if enlarged such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighborhood
what alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune he considered to be more capital those were the two little word more capital
now it appeared to him mr_pumblechook that if that capital were got into the business through a sleeping partner sir which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in by self or deputy whenever he pleased and examine the book and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket to the tune of fifty per cent it appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property which would be worthy of his attention
but what did i think he had great confidence in my opinion and what did i think i gave it as my opinion
the united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him that he no longer asked if he might shake hand with me but said he really must and did
we drank all the wine and mr_pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep joseph_gargery up to the mark i dont know what mark and to render me efficient and constant service
he also made known to me for the first time in my life and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well that he had always said of me that boy is no common boy and mark me his fortun will be no common fortun
he said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now and i said so too
finally i went out into the air with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine and found that i had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road
wait a bit i dont know what service there i was roused by mr_pumblechook hailing me he was a long way down the sunny street and was making expressive gestures for me to stop
i stopped and he came up breathless no my dear friend said he when he had recovered wind for speech
not if i can help it this occasion shall not entirely pass without that affability on your part may i as an old friend and well wisher
we shook hand for the hundredth time at least and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation
then he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until i had passed the crook in the road and then i turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before i pursued my way home
i had scant luggage to take with me to london for little of the little i possessed was adapted to my new station
but i began packing that same afternoon and wildly packed up thing that i knew i should want next morning in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost
so tuesday wednesday and thursday passed and on friday morning i went to mr_pumblechook to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to miss_havisham
mr_pumblechook own room was given up to me to dress in and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event
probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in fell a trifle short of the wearer expectation
but after i had had my new suit on some half an hour and had gone through an immensity of posturing with mr_pumblechook very limited dressing glass in the futile endeavor to see my leg it seemed to fit me better
may i my clothes were rather a disappointment of course it being market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off mr_pumblechook was not at home
i had not told him exactly when i meant to leave and was not likely to shake hand with him again before departing
this was all as it should be and i went out in my new array fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman and suspicious after all that i was at a personal disadvantage something like mrs_joe_gargery in his sunday suit
i went circuitously to miss_havisham by all the back way and rang at the bell constrainedly on account of the stiff long finger of my gloves
miss_sarah_pocket came to the gate and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed her walnut shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow
you said she you good gracious what do you want i am going to london miss pocket said i and want to say good bye to miss_havisham
i was not expected for she left me locked in the yard while she went to ask if i were to be admitted
after a very short delay she returned and took me up staring at me all the way miss_havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table leaning on her crutch stick
the room was lighted as of yore and at the sound of our entrance she stopped and turned she was then just abreast of the rotted bride cake
i start for london miss_havisham to morrow i was exceedingly careful what i said and i thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you
this is a gay figure mr_pip said she making her crutch stick play round me as if she the fairy godmother who had changed me were bestowing the finishing gift
dont go miss_sarah_pocket she said well mr_pip i have come into such good fortune since i saw you last miss_havisham i murmured
and i am so grateful for it miss_havisham ay ay said she looking at the discomfited and envious miss_sarah_pocket with delight
i have seen mr_jaggers i have heard about it mr_pip so you go to morrow yes miss_havisham
and you are adopted by a rich person yes miss_havisham not named no miss_havisham and mr_jaggers is made your guardian
yes miss_havisham she quite gloated on these question and answers so keen was her enjoyment of miss_sarah_pocket jealous dismay
well she went on you have a promising career before you be good deserve it and abide by mr_jaggers instructions
she looked at me and looked at miss_sarah_pocket and miss_sarah_pocket countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile
good bye mr_pip you will always keep the name of mr_pip you know yes miss_havisham good bye mr_pip she stretched out her hand and i went down on my knee and put it to my lips
i had not considered how i should take leave of her it came naturally to me at the moment to do this
she looked at miss_sarah_pocket with triumph in her weird eye and so i left my fairy godmother with both her hand on her crutch stick standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride cake that was hidden in cobwebs
miss_sarah_pocket conducted me down as if i were a ghost who must be seen out she could not get over my appearance and was in the last degree confounded
i said good bye miss pocket but she merely stared and did not seem collected enough to know that i had spoken
clear of the house i made the best of my way back to mr_pumblechook took off my new clothes made them into a bundle and went back home in my older dress carrying it to speak the truth much more at my ease too though i had the bundle to carry
and now those six day which were to have run out so slowly had run out fast and were gone and to morrow looked me in the face more steadily than i could look at it
as the six evening had dwindled away to five to four to three to two i had become more and more appreciative of the society of mrs_joe_gargery and biddy
on this last evening i dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight and sat in my splendor until bedtime
we had a hot supper on the occasion graced by the inevitable roast fowl and we had some flip to finish with
i was to leave our village at five in the morning carrying my little hand portmanteau and i had told mrs_joe_gargery that i wished to walk away all alone
i am afraid sore afraid that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and mrs_joe_gargery if we went to the coach together
i had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement but when i went up to my little room on this last night i felt compelled to admit that it might be so and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat mrs_joe_gargery to walk with me in the morning
all night there were coach in my broken sleep going to wrong place instead of to london and having in the traces now dogs now cats now pigs now man never horses
we were all very low and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits i did not fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing
then i got up and partly dressed and sat at the window to take a last look out and in taking it fell asleep
biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast that although i did not sleep at the window an hour i smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when i started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon
but long after that and long after i had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready i wanted the resolution to go downstairs
after all i remained up there repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again until biddy called to me that i was late
i got up from the meal saying with a sort of briskness as if it had only just occurred to me well i suppose i must be off
and then i kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair and kissed biddy and threw my arm around mrs_joe_gargery neck
it was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it then i took up my little portmanteau and walked out
the last i saw of them was when i presently heard a scuffle behind me and looking back saw mrs_joe_gargery throwing an old shoe after me and biddy throwing another old shoe
i stopped then to wave my hat and dear old mrs_joe_gargery waved his strong right arm above his head crying huskily hooroar and biddy put her apron to her face
i walked away at a good pace thinking it was easier to go than i had supposed it would be and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach in sight of all the high street
but the village was very peaceful and quiet and the light mists were solemnly rising as if to show me the world and i had been so innocent and little there and all beyond was so unknown and great that in a moment with a strong heave and sob i broke into tears
it was by the finger post at the end of the village and i laid my hand upon it and said good bye my dear dear friend
heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth overlying our hard heart
i whistled and made nothing of going i was better after i had cried than before more sorry more aware of my own ingratitude more gentle
so subdued i was by those tears and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk that when i was on the coach and it was clear of the town i deliberated with an aching heart whether i would not get down when we changed horses and walk back and have another evening at home and a better parting
we changed and i had not made up my mind and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back when we changed again
and while i was occupied with these deliberations i would fancy an exact resemblance to mrs_joe_gargery in some man coming along the road towards us and my heart would beat high as if he could possibly be there
we changed again and yet again and it was now too late and too far to go back and i went on
if i had cried before i should have had mrs_joe_gargery with me then and the mists had all solemnly risen now and the world lay spread before me
this is the end of the first stage of mr_pip expectations chapter xx the journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hour
it was a little past midday when the four horse stage coach by which i was a passenger got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the cross keys wood street cheapside london
we britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything otherwise while i was scared by the immensity of london i think i might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly crooked narrow and dirty
mr_jaggers had duly sent me his address it was little britain and he had written after it on his card just out of smithfield and close by the coach office
nevertheless a hackney coachman who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great coat as he was year old packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps as if he were going to take me fifty miles
his getting on his box which i remember to have been decorated with an old weather stained pea green hammercloth moth eaten into rags was quite a work of time
it was a wonderful equipage with six great coronets outside and ragged thing behind for i dont know how many footmen to hold on by and a harrow below them to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation
i had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw yard it was and yet how like a rag shop and to wonder why the horses nose bags were kept inside when i observed the coachman beginning to get down as if we were going to stop presently
and stop we presently did in a gloomy street at certain office with an open door whereon was painted mr
mr_jaggers how much i asked the coachman the coachman answered a shilling unless you wish to make it more
i naturally said i had no wish to make it more then it must be a shilling observed the coachman
i dont want to get into trouble i know him he darkly closed an eye at mr_jaggers name and shook his head
when he had got his shilling and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box and had got away which appeared to relieve his mind i went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked
was mr_jaggers at home he is not returned the clerk he is in court at present am i addressing mr_pip
i signified that he was addressing mr_pip mr_jaggers left word would you wait in his room he couldnt say how long he might be having a case on
but it stands to reason his time being valuable that he wont be longer than he can help with those word the clerk opened a door and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back
here we found a gentleman with one eye in a velveteen suit and knee breeches who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper
i began to say that i hoped i was not interrupting when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as i ever saw used and tossing his fur cap out after him left me alone
mr_jaggers room was lighted by a skylight only and was a most dismal place the skylight eccentrically pitched like a broken head and the distorted adjoining house looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it
there were not so many papers about as i should have expected to see and there were some odd objects about that i should not have expected to see such as an old rusty pistol a sword in a scabbard several strange looking boxes and packages and two dreadful casts on a shelf of face peculiarly swollen and twitchy about the nose
mr_jaggers own high backed chair was of deadly black horsehair with rows of brass nails round it like a coffin and i fancied i could see how he leaned back in it and bit his forefinger at the clients
the room was but small and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall the wall especially opposite to mr_jaggers chair being greasy with shoulder
i recalled too that the one eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when i was the innocent cause of his being turned out
i sat down in the cliental chair placed over against mr_jaggers chair and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place
i called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else disadvantage as his master had
i wondered how many other clerks there were upstairs and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow creatures
go and wait outside mike said the clerk i wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room and how it came there
i wondered whether the two swollen face were of mr_jaggers family and if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill looking relations why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on instead of giving them a place at home
of course i had no experience of a london summer day and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything
but i sat wondering and waiting in mr_jaggers close room until i really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above mr_jaggers chair and got up and went out
when i told the clerk that i would take a turn in the air while i waited he advised me to go round the corner
so i came into smithfield and the shameful place being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam seemed to stick to me
so i rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where i saw the great black dome of saint paul bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was newgate prison
following the wall of the jail i found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles and from this and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer i inferred that the trials were on
while i looked about me here an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if i would like to step in and hear a trial or so informing me that he could give me a front place for half a crown whence
i should command a full view of the lord chief justice in his wig and robes mentioning that awful personage like waxwork and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen pence
as i declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept and also where people were publicly whipped and then he showed me the debtors door out of which culprits came to be hanged heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that four on em would come out at that door the day after to morrow at eight in the morning to be killed in a row
this was horrible and gave me a sickening idea of london the more so as the lord chief justice proprietor wore from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket handkerchief inclusive mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally and which i took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner
i dropped into the office to ask if mr_jaggers had come in yet and i found he had not and i strolled out again
this time i made the tour of little britain and turned into bartholomew close and now i became aware that other people were waiting about for mr_jaggers as well as i_
there were two man of secret appearance lounging in bartholomew close and thoughtfully fitting their foot into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together one of whom said to the other when they first passed me that mr_jaggers would do it if it was to be done
there was a knot of three man and two woman standing at a corner and one of the woman was crying on her dirty shawl and the other comforted her by saying as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulder mr_jaggers is for him melia and what more could you have
and i should come into smithfield under these circumstance i thought myself well rid of him for a shilling
there was a red eyed little jew who came into the close while i was loitering there in company with a second little jew whom he sent upon an errand and while the messenger was gone i remarked this jew who was of a highly excitable temperament performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp post and accompanying himself in a kind of frenzy with the word jaggerth jaggerth jaggerth
these testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me and i admired and wondered more than ever
at length as i was looking out at the iron gate of bartholomew close into little britain i saw mr_jaggers coming across the road towards me
all otherth ith cag maggerth give me jaggerth all the others who were waiting saw him at the same time and there was quite a rush at him
mr_jaggers putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me addressed himself to his followers
first he took the two secret man now i have nothing to say to you said mr_jaggers throwing his finger at them
i want to know no more than i know as to the result it a toss up i told you from the first it was a toss up
we made the money up this morning sir said one of the man submissively while the other perused mr_jaggers face
have you paid mr_wemmick i dont ask you when you made it up or where or whether you made it up at all
has mr_wemmick got it yes sir said both the man together very well then you may go now i wont have it said mr_jaggers waving his hand at them to put them behind him
if you say a word to me i ll throw up the case we thought mr_jaggers one of the man began pulling off his hat
that what i told you not to do said mr_jaggers you thought i think for you that enough for you
if i want you i know where to find you i dont want you to find me now i wont have it
the two man looked at one another as mr_jaggers waved them behind again and humbly fell back and were heard no more
and now you said mr_jaggers suddenly stopping and turning on the two woman with the shawls from whom the three man had meekly separated oh
i wont hear a word amelia is it yes mr_jaggers and do you remember retorted mr_jaggers that
but for me you wouldnt be here and couldnt be here yes sir exclaimed both woman together
lord bless you sir well we knows that then why said mr_jaggers do you come here my bill_barley sir
the crying woman pleaded now i tell you what said mr_jaggers once for all if you dont know that your bill_barley in good hand i know it
and if you come here bothering about your bill_barley i ll make an example of both your bill_barley and you and let him slip through my finger
have you paid mr_wemmick yes sir every farden very well then you have done all you have got to do
say another word one single word and mr_wemmick shall give you your money back this terrible threat caused the two woman to fall off immediately
no one remained now but the excitable jew who had already raised the skirts of mr_jaggers coat to his lips several time
i dont know this man said mr_jaggers in the same devastating strain what does this fellow want ma thear mithter jaggerth
hown brother to habraham latharuth who he said mr_jaggers let go of my coat the suitor kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it replied habraham latharuth on thuthpithion of plate
you re too late said mr_jaggers i am over the way holy father mithter jaggerth cried my excitable acquaintance turning white dont thay you re again habraham latharuth
i am said mr_jaggers and there an end of it get out of the way mithter jaggerth half a moment
my hown cuthen th gone to mithter mr_wemmick at thith prethent minute to hoffer him hany termth mithter jaggerth half a quarter of a moment
my guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot
without further interruption we reached the front office where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap
if you have the condethenthun to be bought off from thet other thide at hany thuperior prithe money no object mithter jaggerth mithter
oh said mr_jaggers turning to the man who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead like the bull in cock robin pulling at the bell rope your man comes on this afternoon
well mas mr_jaggers returned mike in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold arter a deal trouble i ve found one sir as might do
here mike said the clerk getting down from his stool and approaching mr_jaggers confidentially well what is he prepared to swear
well mas mr_jaggers said mike wiping his nose on his fur cap this time in a general way anythink
now i warned you before said he throwing his forefinger at the terrified client that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here i make an example of you
mr_jaggers suddenly became most irate you infernal scoundrel how dare you tell me that the client looked scared but bewildered too as if he were unconscious what he had done
spooney said the clerk in a low voice giving him a stir with his elbow soft head need you say it face to face
now i ask you you blundering booby said my guardian very sternly once more and for the last time what the man you have brought here is prepared to swear
mike looked hard at my guardian as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face and slowly replied ayther to character or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question
mike looked at his cap and looked at the floor and looked at the ceiling and looked at the clerk and even looked at me before beginning to reply in a nervous manner
now be careful in what station of life is this man we ve dressed him up like when my guardian blustered out
what you will will you spooney added the clerk again with another stir after some helpless casting about mike brightened and began again
he is dressed like a spectable pieman a sort of a pastry cook is he here asked my guardian i left him said mike a setting on some doorsteps round the corner
we all three went to it behind the wire blind and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner with a murderous looking tall individual in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap
this guileless confectioner was not by any means sober and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery which was painted over
tell him to take his witness away directly said my guardian to the clerk in extreme disgust and ask him what he means by bringing such a fellow as that
my guardian then took me into his own room and while he lunched standing from a sandwich box and a pocket flask of sherry he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it informed me what arrangements he had made for me
i was to go to barnard inn to young mr_matthew_pocket room where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation i was to remain with young mr_matthew_pocket until monday on monday i was to go with him to his father house on a visit that i might try how i liked it
also i was told what my allowance was to be it was a very liberal one and had handed to me from one of my guardian drawers the cards of certain tradesmen with whom i was to deal for all kind of clothes and such other thing as i could in reason want
take him past that window and let me see him the window indicated was the office window
you will find your credit good mr_pip said my guardian whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful as he hastily refreshed himself but i shall by this means be able to check your bills and to pull you up if i find you outrunning the constable
after i had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment i asked mr_jaggers if i could send for a coach
of course you ll go wrong somehow but that no fault of mine he said it was not worth while i was so near my destination mr_wemmick should walk round with me if i pleased
another clerk was rung down from upstairs to take his place while he was out and i accompanied him into the street after shaking hand with my guardian
we found a new set of people lingering outside but mr_wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively i tell you it no use he wont have a word to say to one of you and we soon got clear of them and went on side by side
chapter xxi casting my eye on mr_wemmick as we went along to see what he was like in the light of day i found him to be a dry man rather short in stature with a square wooden face whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull edged chisel
there were some marks in it that might have been dimples if the material had been softer and the instrument finer but which as it was were only dints
the chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off
i judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements for he wore at least four mourning rings besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it
i noticed too that several rings and seals hung at his watch chain as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friend
i then found that mr_wemmick was the clerk in the next room he had glittering eye small keen and black and thin wide mottled lips
he had had them to the best of my belief from forty to fifty year so you were never in london before said mr_wemmick to me
no said i i was new here once said mr_wemmick rum to think of now you are well acquainted with it now
why yes said mr_wemmick i know the moves of it is it a very wicked place i asked more for the sake of saying something than for information
you may get cheated robbed and murdered in london but there are plenty of people anywhere who ll do that for you
if there is bad blood between you and them said i to soften it off a little
i dont know about bad blood returned mr_wemmick there not much bad blood about they ll do it if there anything to be got by it
he wore his hat on the back of his head and looked straight before him walking in a self contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention
that makes it worse you think so returned mr_wemmick much about the same i should say his mouth was such a post office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling
we had got to the top of holborn hill before i knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance and that he was not smiling at all
do you know where mr_matthew_pocket life i asked mr_wemmick yes said he nodding in the direction
at hammersmith west of london is that far well say five miles do you know him why you re a regular cross examiner said mr_wemmick looking at me with an approving air
there was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these word that rather depressed me and i was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text when he said here we were at barnard inn
my depression was not alleviated by the announcement for i had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by mr barnard to which the blue_boar in our town was a mere public house
whereas i now found barnard to be a disembodied spirit or a fiction and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for tom cats
we entered this haven through a wicket gate and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying ground
i thought it had the most dismal trees in it and the most dismal sparrows and the most dismal cats and the most dismal house in number half a dozen or so that i had ever seen
i thought the window of the sets of chambers into which those house were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain crippled flower pot cracked glass dusty decay and miserable makeshift
while to let to let to let glared at me from empty room as if no new wretches ever came there and the vengeance of the soul of barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel
a frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of barnard and it had strewn ashes on its head and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust hole
thus far my sense of sight while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching stables near at hand besides addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell and moaned try barnard mixture
yes i know him i know him so imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations that i looked in dismay at mr_wemmick
he led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust so that one of those day the upper lodgers would look out at their door and find themselves without the means of coming down to a set of chambers on the top floor
ah said he mistaking me the retirement reminds you of the country so it does me mr_matthew_pocket jun
was painted on the door and there was a label on the letter box return shortly he hardly thought you come so soon mr_wemmick explained
you dont want me any more no thank you said i as i keep the cash mr_wemmick observed we shall most likely meet pretty often
good day good day i put out my hand and mr_wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought i wanted something
then he looked at me and said correcting himself to be sure yes you re in the habit of shaking hand
i was rather confused thinking it must be out of the london fashion but said yes i have got so out of it said mr_wemmick except at last
when we had shaken hand and he was gone i opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself for the lines had rotted away and it came down like the guillotine
very glad i sure to make your acquaintance good day happily it was so quick that i had not put my head out
after this escape i was content to take a foggy view of the inn through the window encrusting dirt and to stand dolefully looking out saying to myself that london was decidedly overrated
mr_matthew_pocket junior idea of shortly was not mine for i had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour and had written my name with my finger several time in the dirt of every pane in the window before i heard footsteps on the stairs
gradually there arose before me the hat head neckcloth waistcoat trousers boots of a member of society of about my own standing
he had a paper bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand and was out of breath
i am extremely sorry but i knew there was a coach from your part of the country at midday and i thought you would come by that one
mr_pip said he mr_matthew_pocket said i dear me he exclaimed the fact is i have been out on your account not that that is any excuse for
i thought coming from the country you might like a little fruit after dinner and i went to covent garden market to get it good
for a reason that i had i felt as if my eye would start out of my head i acknowledged his attention incoherently and began to think this was a dream
as he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while the paper bags were under his arm i begged him to allow me to hold them
dear me said mr_matthew_pocket junior this door sticks so he relinquished them with an agreeable smile and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast
it yielded so suddenly at last that he staggered back upon me and i staggered back upon the opposite door and we both laughed
but still i felt as if my eye must start out of my head and as if this must be a dream
pray come in said mr_matthew_pocket junior allow me to lead the way i am rather bare here but i hope you ll be able to make out tolerably well till monday
my father thought you would get on more agreeably through to morrow with me than with him and might like to take a walk about london
as to our table you wont find that bad i hope for it will be supplied from our coffee house here and it is only right i should add at your expense such being mr_jaggers directions
as to our lodging it not by any means splendid because i have my own bread to earn and my father hasnt anything to give me and i shouldnt be willing to take it if he had
this is our sitting room just such chair and table and carpet and so forth you see as they could spare from home
i am sure i shall be very happy to show london to you you mustnt give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors because they come for you from the coffee house
this is your bedroom the furniture hired for the occasion but i trust it will answer the purpose if you should want anything i ll go and fetch it
this is my little bedroom rather musty but barnard is musty the chambers are retired and we shall be alone together but we shant fight i dare say
but dear me i beg your pardon you re holding the fruit all this time pray let me take these bags from you
as i stood opposite to mr_matthew_pocket junior delivering him the bags one two i saw the starting appearance come into his own eye that i knew to be in mine and he said falling back
i am quite ashamed lord bless me you re the prowling boy and you said i are the pale young gentleman
chapter xxii the pale young gentleman and i stood contemplating one another in barnard inn until we both burst out laughing
the idea of its being you said he the idea of its being you said i and then we contemplated one another afresh and laughed again
well said the pale young gentleman reaching out his hand good humoredly it all over now i hope and it will be magnanimous in you if you ll forgive me for having knocked you about so
i derived from this speech that mr herbert_pocket for herbert_pocket was the pale young gentleman name still rather confounded his intention with his execution
but i made a modest reply and we shook hand warmly you hadnt come into your good fortune at that time said herbert_pocket
no said i no he acquiesced i heard it had happened very lately i was rather on the lookout for good fortune then
indeed yes miss_havisham had sent for me to see if she could take a fancy to me but she couldnt at all events she didnt
i thought it polite to remark that i was surprised to hear that bad taste said herbert_pocket laughing but a fact
yes she had sent for me on a trial visit and if i had come out of it successfully i suppose i should have been provided for
he was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked which divided his attention and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word
perhaps i should have been what you may called it to miss_estella what that i asked with sudden gravity affianced he explained still busy with the fruit
betrothed engaged what his named any word of that sort how did you bear your disappointment i asked pooh
said he i didnt care much for it she a tartar miss_havisham i dont say no to that but i meant miss_estella
that girl hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree and has been brought up by miss_havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex
what relation is she to miss_havisham none said he only adopted why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex
what revenge lord mr_pip said he dont you know no said i dear me it quite a story and shall be saved till dinner time
i told him and he was attentive until i had finished and then burst out laughing again and asked me if i was sore afterwards
and now let me take the liberty of asking you a question how did you come there that day i didnt ask him if he was for my conviction on that point was perfectly established
mr_jaggers is your guardian i understand he went on yes you know he is miss_havisham man of business and solicitor and has her confidence when nobody else has
i answered with a constraint i made no attempt to disguise that i had seen mr_jaggers in miss_havisham house on the very day of our combat but never at any other time and that i believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there
he was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor and he called on my father to propose it
this was bringing me i felt towards dangerous ground of course he knew about my father from his connection with miss_havisham
my father is miss_havisham cousin not that that implies familiar intercourse between them for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her
i had never seen any one then and i have never seen any one since who more strongly expressed to me in every look and tone a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean
herbert_pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking there was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air and something that at the same time whispered to me
i became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner but i cannot define by what means
he was still a pale young gentleman and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness that did not seem indicative of natural strength
he would never be very successful or rich i dont know how this was he had not a handsome face but it was better than handsome being extremely amiable and cheerful
his figure was a little ungainly as in the day when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it but it looked as if it would always be light and young
whether mr_trabb local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me may be a question but i am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than i carried off my new suit
as he was so communicative i felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our year
i further mentioned that as i had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place and knew very little of the way of politeness i would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong
i therefore told him my small story and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was
with pleasure said he though i venture to prophesy that you ll want very few hints i dare say we shall be often together and i should like to banish any needless restraint between us
will you do me the favour to begin at once to call me by my christian name herbert_pocket i thanked him and said i would
i dont take to philip said he smiling for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling book who was so lazy that he fell into a pond or so fat that he couldnt see out of his eye or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it or so determined to go a bird nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighborhood
i informed him in exchange that my christian name was philip i tell you what i should like we are so harmonious and you have been a blacksmith would
you mind it i shouldnt mind anything that you propose i answered but i dont understand you would you mind handel for a familiar name
then my dear handel said he turning round as the door opened here is the dinner and i must beg of you to take the top of the table because the dinner is of your providing
there a charming piece of music by handel called the harmonious blacksmith i should like it very much
it was a nice little dinner seemed to me then a very lord mayor feast and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstance with no old people by and with london all around us
this again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off for while the table was as mr_pumblechook might have said the lap of luxury being entirely furnished forth from the coffee house the circumjacent region of sitting room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor where he fell over them the melted butter in the arm chair the bread on the bookshelves the cheese in the coal scuttle and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next
this i would not hear of so he took the top and i faced him room where i found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when i retired for the night
all this made the feast delightful and when the waiter was not there to watch me my pleasure was without alloy
we had made some progress in the dinner when i reminded herbert_pocket of his promise to tell me about miss_havisham
let me introduce the topic handel by mentioning that in london it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth for fear of accidents and that while the fork is reserved for that use it is not put further in than necessary
true he replied i ll redeem it at once it is scarcely worth mentioning only it as well to do as other people do
you get at your mouth better which after all is the object and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters on the part of the right elbow
also the spoon is not generally used over hand but under this has two advantages he offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way that we both laughed and i scarcely blushed
now he pursued concerning miss_havisham miss havisham you must know was a spoilt child her mother died when she was a baby and her father denied her nothing
i dont know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer but it is indisputable that while you cannot possibly be genteel and bake you may be as genteel as never was and brew
her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world and was a brewer you see it every day
yet a gentleman may not keep a public house may he said i not on any account returned herbert_pocket but a public house may keep a gentleman
well mr havisham was very rich and very proud so was his daughter miss_havisham was an only child
i hazarded stop a moment i am coming to that no she was not an only child she had a half brother
her father privately married again his cook i rather think i thought he was proud said i my good handel so he was
when she was dead i apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done and then the son became a part of the family residing in the house you are acquainted with
he married his second wife privately because he was proud and in course of time she died as the son grew a young man he turned out riotous extravagant undutiful altogether bad
at last his father disinherited him but he softened when he was dying and left him well off though not nearly so well off as miss_havisham take another glass of wine and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one glass as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one nose
i had been doing this in an excess of attention to his recital i thanked him and apologized he said not at all and resumed
her half brother had now ample means again but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again
there were stronger differences between him and her than there had been between him and his father and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father anger
now i come to the cruel part of the story merely breaking off my dear handel to remark that a dinner napkin will not go into a tumbler
miss_havisham was now an heiress and you may suppose was looked after as a great match why i was trying to pack mine into my tumbler i am wholly unable to say
i only know that i found myself with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits
again i thanked him and apologized and again he said in the cheerfullest manner not at all i am sure and resumed
there appeared upon the scene say at the races or the public balls or anywhere else you like a certain man who made love to miss_havisham
i never saw him for this happened five and twenty year ago before you and i were handel but i have heard my father mention that he was a showy man and the kind of man for the purpose
but that he was not to be without ignorance or prejudice mistaken for a gentleman my father most strongly asseverates because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was since the world began a true gentleman in manner
he says no varnish can hide the grain of the wood and that the more varnish you put on the more the grain will express itself
i believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time but all the susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then and she passionately loved him
well this man pursued miss_havisham closely and professed to be devoted to her there is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him
he practised on her affection in that systematic way that he got great sums of money from her and he induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery which had been weakly left him by his father at an immense price on the plea that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all
your guardian was not at that time in miss_havisham counsels and she was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one
her relations were poor and scheming with the exception of my father he was poor enough but not time serving or jealous
the only independent one among them he warned her that she was doing too much for this man and was placing herself too unreservedly in his power
she took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house in his presence and my father has never seen her since
i thought of her having said mr_matthew_pocket will come and see me at last when i am laid dead upon that table and i asked herbert_pocket whether his father was so inveterate against her
it not that said he but she charged him in the presence of her intended husband with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement and if he were to go to her now it would look true even to him and even to her
the marriage day was fixed the wedding dresses were bought the wedding tour was planned out the wedding guests were invited
to return to the man and make an end of him the day came but not the bridegroom he wrote her a letter which she received i struck in when she was dressing for her marriage
at twenty minutes to nine at the hour and minute said herbert_pocket nodding at which she afterwards stopped all the clocks
what was in it further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off i cant tell you because i dont know
when she recovered from a bad illness that she had she laid the whole place waste as you have seen it and she has never since looked upon the light of day
all i know of it and indeed i only know so much through piecing it out for myself for my father always avoids it and even when miss_havisham invited me to go there told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite i should understand
it has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence acted throughout in concert with her half brother that it was a conspiracy between them and that they shared the profits
is that all the story i asked after considering it but i have forgotten one thing i wonder he didnt marry her and get all the property said i_
he may have been married already and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her half brother scheme said herbert_pocket
mind i dont know that what became of the two man i asked after again considering the subject
they fell into deeper shame and degradation if there can be deeper and ruin are they alive now i dont know
you said just now that miss_estella was not related to miss_havisham but adopted when adopted herbert_pocket shrugged his shoulder
and now handel said he finally throwing off the story as it were there is a perfectly open understanding between us
there has always been an miss_estella since i have heard of a miss_havisham i know no more all that i know about miss_havisham you know
and all that i know i retorted you know i fully believe it so there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me
and as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in life namely that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe it you may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon or even approached by me or by any one belonging to me
in truth he said this with so much delicacy that i felt the subject done with even though i should be under his father roof for year and year to come
yet he said it with so much meaning too that i felt he as perfectly understood miss_havisham to be my benefactress as i understood the fact myself
it had not occurred to me before that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it that i now perceived this to be the case
we were very gay and sociable and i asked him in the course of conversation what he was he replied a capitalist an insurer of ships
i suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of shipping or capital for he added in the city
i had grand idea of the wealth and importance of insurers of ships in the city and i began to think with awe of having laid a young insurer on his back blackened his enterprising eye and cut his responsible head open
but again there came upon me for my relief that odd impression that herbert_pocket would never be very successful or rich
i shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships i shall buy up some good life assurance shares and cut into the direction
i shall also do a little in the mining way none of these thing will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account
i think i shall trade said he leaning back in his chair to the east indies for silks shawls spices dyes drugs and precious woods
it an interesting trade and the profits are large said i tremendous said he i wavered again and began to think here were greater expectations than my own
i think i shall trade also said he putting his thumbs in his waist coat pocket to the west indies for sugar tobacco and rum
also to ceylon specially for elephants tusks you will want a good many ships said i a perfect fleet said he
quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions i asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present
i havent begun insuring yet he replied i am looking about me somehow that pursuit seemed more in keeping with barnard inn
i said in a tone of conviction ah yes i am in a counting house and looking about me is a counting house profitable
i asked to do you mean to the young fellow who in it he asked in reply yes to you
why no not to me he said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance
this certainly had not a profitable appearance and i shook my head as if i would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income
not directly profitable that is it doesnt pay me anything and i have to keep myself but the thing is said herbert_pocket that you look about you
it struck me as a singular implication that you couldnt be out of a counting house you know and look about you but i silently deferred to his experience
that the grand thing you are in a counting house you know and you look about you then the time comes said herbert_pocket when you see your opening
and you go in and you swoop upon it and you make your capital and then there you are when you have once made your capital you have nothing to do but employ it
this was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden very like his manner of bearing his poverty too exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat
it seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then
it was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries for everything that i remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee house or somewhere else
yet having already made his fortune in his own mind he was so unassuming with it that i felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up
in the evening we went out for a walk in the streets and went half price to the theatre and next day we went to church at westminster abbey and in the afternoon we walked in the parks and i wondered who shod all the horses there and wished mrs_joe_gargery did
it was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant way and we got on famously on a moderate computation it was many months that sunday since i had left mrs_joe_gargery and biddy
that i could have been at our old church in my old church going clothes on the very last sunday that ever was seemed a combination of impossibilities geographical and social solar and lunar
yet in the london streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening there were depressing hints of reproaches for that i had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away and in the dead of night the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about barnard inn under pretence of watching it fell hollow on my heart
on the monday morning at a quarter before nine herbert_pocket went to the counting house to report himself to look about him too
the space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion and our marsh were any distance off i suppose and i bore him company
he was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to hammersmith and i was to wait about for him
it appeared to me that the eggs from which young insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat like the eggs of ostriches judging from the place to which those incipient giants repaired on a monday morning
nor did the counting house where herbert_pocket assisted show in my eye as at all a good observatory being a back second floor up a yard of a grimy presence in all particulars and with a look into another back second floor rather than a look out
i waited about until it was noon and i went upon change and i saw fluey man sitting there under the bills about shipping whom i took to be great merchants though i couldnt understand why they should all be out of spirits
when herbert_pocket came we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which i then quite venerated but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in europe and where i could not help noticing even then that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters clothes than in the steaks
this collation disposed of at a moderate price considering the grease which was not charged for we went back to barnard inn and got my little portmanteau and then took coach for hammersmith
we arrived there at two or three clock in the afternoon and had very little way to walk to mr_matthew_pocket house
lifting the latch of a gate we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river where mr_matthew_pocket child were playing about
and unless i deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned i saw that mr and mrs_pocket child were not growing up or being brought up but were tumbling up
mrs_pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree reading with her leg upon another garden chair and mrs_pocket two nurse maids were looking about them while the child played
mamma said herbert_pocket this is young mr_pip upon which mrs_pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity
master alick and miss_jane cried one of the nurses to two of the child if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you ll fall over into the river and be drownded and what ll your pa say then
at the same time this nurse picked up mrs_pocket handkerchief and said if that dont make six time you ve dropped it mum
upon which mrs_pocket laughed and said thank you flopson and settling herself in one chair only resumed her book
her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week but before she could have read half a dozen lines she fixed her eye upon me and said i hope your mamma is quite well
this unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that i began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person i had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments when the nurse came to my rescue
well she cried picking up the pocket handkerchief if that dont make seven time what are you a doing of this afternoon mum
mrs_pocket received her property at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before and then with a laugh of recognition and said thank you flopson and forgot me and went on reading
i found now i had leisure to count them that there were no fewer than six little pocket present in various stages of tumbling up
i had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard as in the region of air wailing dolefully
millers who was the other nurse retired into the house and by degrees the child wailing was hushed and stopped as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth
if there aint baby said flopson appearing to think it most surprising make haste up millers mrs_pocket read all the time and i was curious to know what the book could be
we were waiting i supposed for mr_matthew_pocket to come out to us at any rate we waited there and so i had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the child strayed near mrs_pocket in their play they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her always very much to her momentary astonishment and their own more enduring lamentation
i was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it until by and by millers came down with the baby which baby was handed to flopson which flopson was handing it to mrs_pocket when she too went fairly head foremost over mrs_pocket baby and all and was caught by herbert_pocket and myself
gracious me flopson said mrs_pocket looking off her book for a moment everybody tumbling gracious you indeed mum
returned flopson very red in the face what have you got there i got here flopson asked mrs_pocket
why if it aint your footstool cried flopson and if you keep it under your skirts like that who to help tumbling
mrs_pocket acted on the advice and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap while the other child played about it
this had lasted but a very short time when mrs_pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap
thus i made the second discovery on that first occasion that the nurture of the little pocket consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down
under these circumstance when flopson and millers had got the child into the house like a little flock of sheep and mr_matthew_pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance i was not much surprised to find that mr_matthew_pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face and with his very gray hair disordered on his head as if he didnt quite see his way to putting anything straight
here take the baby mum and give me your book chapter xxiii mr_matthew_pocket said he was glad to see me and he hoped i was not sorry to see him
he was a young looking man in spite of his perplexities and his very gray hair and his manner seemed quite natural
i use the word natural in the sense of its being unaffected there was something comic in his distraught way as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so
when he had talked with me a little he said to mrs_pocket with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows which were black and handsome belinda i hope you have welcomed mr_pip
for i really am not he added with his son smile an alarming personage and she looked up from her book and said yes
she then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind and asked me if i liked the taste of orange flower water
as the question had no bearing near or remote on any foregone or subsequent transaction i consider it to have been thrown out like her previous approaches in general conversational condescension
i found out within a few hour and may mention at once that mrs_pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased knight who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a baronet but for somebody determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives i forget whose if i ever knew the
sovereign the prime minister the lord chancellor the archbishop of canterbury anybody and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact
i believe he had been knighted himself for storming the english grammar at the point of the pen in a desperate address engrossed on vellum on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other and for handing some royal personage either the trowel or the mortar
be that as it may he had directed mrs_pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of thing must marry a title and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge
so successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent that she had grown up highly ornamental but perfectly helpless and useless
with her character thus happily formed in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered mr_matthew_pocket who was also in the first bloom of youth and not quite decided whether to mount to the woolsack or to roof himself in with a mitre
as his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time he and mrs_pocket had taken time by the forelock when to judge from its length it would seem to have wanted cutting and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent
the judicious parent having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle and had informed mr_matthew_pocket that his wife was a treasure for a prince
mr_matthew_pocket had invested the prince treasure in the way of the world ever since and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest
still mrs_pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity because she had not married a title while mr_matthew_pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach because he had never got one
mr_matthew_pocket took me into the house and showed me my room which was a pleasant one and so furnished as that i could use it with comfort for my own private sitting room
he then knocked at the door of two other similar room and introduced me to their occupants by name mr_drummle and startop
startop younger in year and appearance was reading and holding his head as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge
both mr and mrs_pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else hand that i wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there until i found this unknown power to be the servants
it was a smooth way of going on perhaps in respect of saving trouble but it had the appearance of being expensive for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking and to keep a deal of company downstairs
they allowed a very liberal table to mr and mrs_pocket yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen always supposing the boarder capable of self defence for before i had been there a week a neighboring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted wrote in to say that she had seen millers slapping the baby
this greatly distressed mrs_pocket who burst into tears on receiving the note and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbors couldnt mind their own business
by degrees i learnt and chiefly from herbert_pocket that mr_matthew_pocket had been educated at harrow and at cambridge where he had distinguished himself but that when he had had the happiness of marrying mrs_pocket very early in life he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a grinder
after grinding a number of dull blades of whom it was remarkable that their father when influential were always going to help him to preferment but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the grindstone he had wearied of that poor work and had come to london
here after gradually failing in loftier hopes he had read with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them and had refurbished divers others for special occasion and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction and on such means added to some very moderate private resources still maintained the house i saw
mr and mrs_pocket had a toady neighbor a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody blessed everybody and shed smiles and tears on everybody according to circumstance
this lady name was mrs coiler and i had the honor of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation
she gave me to understand on the stairs that it was a blow to dear mrs_pocket that dear mr_matthew_pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentleman to read with him
that did not extend to me she told me in a gush of love and confidence at that time i had known her something less than five minutes if they were all like me it would be quite another thing
but dear mrs_pocket said mrs coiler after her early disappointment not that dear mr_matthew_pocket was to blame in that requires so much luxury and elegance
mr_drummle an old looking young man of a heavy order of architecture was whistling yes ma am i said to stop her for i was afraid she was going to cry
and she is of so aristocratic a disposition yes ma am i said again with the same object as before
that it is hard said mrs coiler to have dear mr_matthew_pocket time and attention diverted from dear mrs_pocket
i could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher time and attention were diverted from dear mrs_pocket but i said nothing and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manner
it came to my knowledge through what passed between mrs_pocket and mr_drummle while i was attentive to my knife and fork spoon glasses and other instruments of self destruction that mr_drummle whose christian name was mrs_bentley_drummle was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy
it further appeared that the book i had seen mrs_pocket reading in the garden was all about titles and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book if he ever had come at all
mr_drummle didnt say much but in his limited way he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow he spoke as one of the elect and recognized mrs_pocket as a woman and a sister
no one but themselves and mrs coiler the toady neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation and it appeared to me that it was painful to herbert_pocket but it promised to last a long time when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction
to my unutterable amazement i now for the first time saw mr_matthew_pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary but which made no impression on anybody else and with which i soon became as familiar as the rest
he laid down the carving knife and fork being engaged in carving at the moment put his two hand into his disturbed hair and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it
when he had done this and had not lifted himself up at all he quietly went on with what he was about
it was in effect that the cook had mislaid the beef mrs coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me
she had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friend and localities i had left which was altogether snaky and fork tongued and when she made an occasional bounce upon startop who said very little to her or upon mr_drummle who said less i rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table
after dinner the child were introduced and mrs coiler made admiring comments on their eye noses and leg a sagacious way of improving their mind
there were four little girls and two little boy besides the baby who might have been either and the baby next successor who was as yet neither
they were brought in by flopson and millers much as though those two non commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for child and had enlisted these while mrs_pocket looked at the young nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before but didnt quite know what to make of them
i liked it for a few moment but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over
here give me your fork mum and take the baby said flopson dont take it that way or you ll get its head under the table
thus advised mrs_pocket took it the other way and got its head upon the table which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion
dear dear give it me back mum said flopson and miss_jane come and dance to baby do
one of the little girls a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others stepped out of her place by me and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying and laughed
then all the child laughed and mr_matthew_pocket who in the meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair laughed and we all laughed and were glad
flopson by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a dutch doll then got it safely into mrs_pocket lap and gave it the nut crackers to play with at the same time recommending mrs_pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eye and sharply charging miss_jane to look after the same
then the two nurses left the room and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gaming table
i was made very uneasy in my mind by mrs_pocket falling into a discussion with mr_drummle respecting two baronetcies while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine and forgetting all about the baby on her lap who did most appalling thing with the nut crackers
at length little miss_jane perceiving its young brains to be imperilled softly left her place and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away
mrs_pocket finishing her orange at about the same time and not approving of this said to miss_jane you naughty child how dare you
go and sit down this instant mamma dear lisped the little girl baby ood have put hith eyeth out how dare you tell me so retorted mrs_pocket
mrs_pocket dignity was so crushing that i felt quite abashed as if i myself had done something to rouse it
go and sit down in your chair this moment belinda remonstrated mr_matthew_pocket from the other end of the table how can you be so unreasonable
miss_jane only interfered for the protection of baby i will not allow anybody to interfere said mrs_pocket i am surprised mr_matthew_pocket that you should expose me to the affront of interference
good god cried mr_matthew_pocket in an outbreak of desolate desperation are infants to be nut crackered into their tombs and is nobody to save them
i will not be interfered with by miss_jane said mrs_pocket with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender
mr_matthew_pocket got his hand in his hair again and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair
i hope i know my poor grandpapa position miss_jane indeed hear this he helplessly exclaimed to the elements babies are to be nut crackered dead for people poor grandpapa positions
then he let himself down again and became silent we all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on
a pause succeeded during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little miss_jane who appeared to me to be the only member of the family irrespective of servants with whom it had any decided acquaintance
mr_drummle said mrs_pocket will you ring for flopson miss_jane you undutiful little thing go and lie down now baby darling come with ma
it doubled itself up the wrong way over mrs_pocket arm exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny
and it gained its point after all for i saw it through the window within a few minutes being nursed by little miss_jane
it happened that the other five child were left behind at the dinner table through flopson having some private engagement and their not being anybody else business
the baby was the soul of honor and protested with all its might i thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and mr_matthew_pocket which were exemplified in the following manner
mr_matthew_pocket with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled looked at them for some minutes as if he couldnt make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment and why they hadnt been billeted by nature on somebody else
then in a distant missionary way he asked them certain question as why little mrs_joe_gargery had that hole in his frill who said pa flopson was going to mend it when she had time and
then he melted into parental tenderness and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play and then as they went out with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject
how little fanny came by that whitlow who said pa millers was going to poultice it when she didnt forget in the evening there was rowing on the river
i was pretty good at most exercises in which country boy are adepts but as i was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the thames not to say for other water i at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize wherry who plied at our stairs and to whom i was introduced by my new allies
as mr_drummle and startop had each a boat i resolved to set up mine and to cut them both out this practical authority confused me very much by saying i had the arm of a blacksmith
if he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil i doubt if he would have paid it
there was a supper tray after we got home at night and i think we should all have enjoyed ourselves but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence
mr_matthew_pocket was in good spirits when a housemaid came in and said if you please sir i should wish to speak to you
speak to your master said mrs_pocket whose dignity was roused again how can you think of such a thing
go and speak to flopson or speak to me at some other time begging your pardon ma am returned the housemaid i should wish to speak at once and to speak to master
hereupon mr_matthew_pocket went out of the room and we made the best of ourselves until he came back
here the cook lying insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease
this is a pretty thing belinda said mr_matthew_pocket returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair mrs_pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion and said this is that odious sophia doing
did i not see her with my own eye and hear her with my own ears come into the room just now and ask to speak to you
what do you mean belinda demanded mr_matthew_pocket sophia has told you said mrs_pocket but has she not taken me downstairs belinda returned mr_matthew_pocket and shown me the woman and the bundle too
and do you defend her mr_matthew_pocket said mrs_pocket for making mischief mr_matthew_pocket uttered a dismal groan
besides the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the situation that she felt i was born to be a duchess
am i grandpapa granddaughter to be nothing in the house said mrs_pocket there was a sofa where mr_matthew_pocket stood and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the dying gladiator
still in that attitude he said with a hollow voice good night mr_pip when i deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him
after two or three day when i had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to london several time and had ordered all i wanted of my tradesmen mr_matthew_pocket and i had a long talk together
he knew more of my intended career than i knew myself for he referred to his having been told by mr_jaggers that i was not designed for any profession and that i should be well enough educated for my destiny if i could hold my own with the average of young man in prosperous circumstance
he advised my attending certain place in london for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as i wanted and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies
he hoped that with intelligent assistance i should meet with little to discourage me and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his
through his way of saying this and much more to similar purpose he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner and i may state at once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his compact with me that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling mine with him
chapter xxiv i acquiesced of course knowing nothing to the contrary if he had shown indifference as a master i have no doubt
i should have returned the compliment as a pupil he gave me no such excuse and each of us did the other justice
nor did i ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him or anything but what was serious honest and good in his tutor communication with me
when these point were settled and so far carried out as that i had begun to work in earnest it occurred to me that if i could retain my bedroom in barnard inn my life would be agreeably varied while my manner would be none the worse for herbert_pocket society
mr_matthew_pocket did not object to this arrangement but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it it must be submitted to my guardian
i felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save herbert_pocket some expense so i went off to little britain and imparted my wish to mr_jaggers
if i could buy the furniture now hired for me said i and one or two other little thing i should be quite at home there
go it said mr_jaggers with a short laugh i told you you get on well how much do you want
i said i didnt know how much come retorted mr_jaggers how much fifty pounds not nearly so much
more than that eh retorted mr_jaggers lying in wait for me with his hand in his pocket his head on one side and his eye on the wall behind me how much more
five pounds said mr_jaggers this was such a great fall that i said in discomfiture more than that it is so difficult to fix a sum said i hesitating
come said mr_jaggers let get at it twice five will that do three time five will that do four time five will that do
i said i thought that would do handsomely four time five will do handsomely will it said mr_jaggers knitting his brows
now what do you make of four time five what do i make of it ah said mr_jaggers how much
i suppose you make it twenty pounds said i smiling never mind what i make it my friend observed mr_jaggers with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head
i want to know what you make it twenty pounds of course mr_wemmick said mr_jaggers opening his office door
this strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me and that not of an agreeable kind
mr_jaggers never laughed but he wore great bright creaking boots and in poising himself on these boots with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together awaiting an answer he sometimes caused the boots to creak as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way
as he happened to go out now and as mr_wemmick was brisk and talkative i said to mr_wemmick that i hardly knew what to make of mr_jaggers manner
tell him that and he ll take it as a compliment answered mr_wemmick he dont mean that you should know what to make of it oh
take mr_pip written order and pay him twenty pounds for i looked surprised it not personal it professional only professional
mr_wemmick was at his desk lunching and crunching on a dry hard biscuit pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth as if he were posting them
always seems to me said mr_wemmick as if he had set a man trap and was watching it suddenly click you re caught
without remarking that man traps were not among the amenities of life i said i supposed he was very skilful deep said mr_wemmick as australia
pointing with his pen at the office floor to express that australia was understood for the purposes of the figure to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe
if there was anything deeper added mr_wemmick bringing his pen to paper he be it then i said i supposed he had a fine business and mr_wemmick said ca pi tal
then i asked if there were many clerks to which he replied we dont run much into clerks because there only one mr_jaggers and people wont have him at second hand
there are only four of us would you like to see em you are one of us as i may say
when mr_wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post and had paid me my money from a cash box in a safe the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat collar like an iron pigtail we went upstairs
the house was dark and shabby and the greasy shoulder that had left their mark in mr_jaggers room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for year
in the front first floor a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat catcher a large pale puffed swollen man was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to mr_jaggers coffers
in the room over that a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy was similarly engaged with a man with weak eye whom mr_wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling and who would melt me anything
i accepted the offer getting evidence together said mr_wemmick as we came out for the bailey i pleased and who was in an excessive white perspiration as if he had been trying his art on himself
in a back room a high shouldered man with a face ache tied up in dirty flannel who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentleman for mr_jaggers own use
this was all the establishment when we went downstairs again mr_wemmick led me into my guardian room and said this you ve seen already
pray said i as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again whose likenesses are those
these said mr_wemmick getting upon a chair and blowing the dust off the horrible head before bringing them down these are two celebrated one
this chap why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the inkstand to get this blot upon your eyebrow you old rascal
famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit murdered his master and considering that he wasnt brought up to evidence didnt plan it badly
i asked recoiling from the brute as mr_wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve
is it like him like him it himself you know the cast was made in newgate directly after he was taken down
he then explained this affectionate apostrophe by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it and saying had it made for me express
you had a particular fancy for me hadnt you old artful said mr_wemmick is the lady anybody said i no returned mr_wemmick
no deuce a bit of a lady in the case mr_pip except one and she wasnt of this slender lady like sort and you wouldnt have caught her looking after this urn unless there was something to drink in it
only his game you liked your bit of game didnt you mr_wemmick attention being thus directed to his brooch he put down the cast and polished the brooch with his pocket handkerchief
did that other creature come to the same end i asked he has the same look
you re right said mr_wemmick it the genuine look much as if one nostril was caught up with a horse hair and a little fish hook
yes he came to the same end quite the natural end here i assure you he forged wills this blade did if he didnt also put the supposed testators to sleep too
you were a gentlemanly cove though mr_wemmick was again apostrophizing and you said you could write greek yah bounceable
before putting his late friend on his shelf again mr_wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said sent out to buy it for me only the day before
while he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources
as he had shown no diffidence on the subject i ventured on the liberty of asking him the question when he stood before me dusting his hand
what a liar you were i never met such a liar as you yes he returned these are all gifts of that kind
one brings another you see that the way of it i always take em they re curiosities and they re property they may not be worth much but after all they re property and portable
it dont signify to you with your brilliant lookout but as to myself my guiding star always is get hold of portable property
if at any odd time when you have nothing better to do you wouldnt mind coming over to see me at walworth i could offer you a bed and i should consider it an honor
i have not much to show you but such two or three curiosities as i have got you might like to look over and i am fond of a bit of garden and a summer house
when i had rendered homage to this light he went on to say in a friendly manner i said i should be delighted to accept his hospitality
thankee said he then we ll consider that it to come off when convenient to you have you dined with mr_jaggers yet
not yet well said mr_wemmick he ll give you wine and good wine i ll give you punch and not bad punch
and now i ll tell you something when you go to dine with mr_jaggers look at his housekeeper shall i see something very uncommon
well said mr_wemmick you ll see a wild beast tamed not so very uncommon you ll tell me i reply that depends on the original wildness of the beast and the amount of taming
it wont lower your opinion of mr_jaggers powers keep your eye on it i told him i would do so with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened
as i was taking my departure he asked me if i would like to devote five minutes to seeing mr_jaggers at it
for several reason and not least because i didnt clearly know what mr_jaggers would be found to be at i replied in the affirmative
we dived into the city and came up in a crowded police court where a blood relation in the murderous sense of the deceased with the fanciful taste in brooches was standing at the bar uncomfortably chewing something while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross examination i dont know which and was striking her and the bench and everybody present with awe
if anybody of whatsoever degree said a word that he didnt approve of he instantly required to have it taken down
if anybody wouldnt make an admission he said i ll have it out of you and if anybody made an admission he said now i have got you
thieves and thief takers hung in dread rapture on his word and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction
i couldnt make out for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill i only know that when i stole out on tiptoe he was not on the side of the bench for he was making the leg of the old gentleman who presided quite convulsive under the table by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of british law and justice in that chair that day
chapter xxv mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit
heavy in figure movement and comprehension in the sluggish complexion of his face and in the large awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in
the magistrates shivered under a single bite of his finger which side he was on a room he was idle proud niggardly reserved and suspicious
he came of rich people down in somersetshire who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead
thus mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle had come to mr_matthew_pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman and half a dozen head thicker than most gentleman
startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school but he was devotedly attached to her and admired her beyond measure
he had a woman delicacy of feature and was as you may see though you never saw her said herbert_pocket to me exactly like his mother
it was but natural that i should take to him much more kindly than to mr_drummle and that even in the earliest evening of our boating he and i should pull homeward abreast of one another conversing from boat to boat while mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle came up in our wake alone under the overhanging banks and among the rushes
he would always creep in shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way and i always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back water when our own two boat were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid stream
i presented him with a half share in my boat which was the occasion of his often coming down to hammersmith and my possession of a half share in his chambers often took me up to london
i have an affection for the road yet though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope
herbert_pocket was my intimate companion and friend we used to walk between the two place at all hour when i had been in mr_matthew_pocket family a month or two mr and mrs_camilla turned up
mrs_camilla was mr_matthew_pocket sister miss_georgiana whom i had seen at miss_havisham on the same occasion also turned up she was a cousin an indigestive single woman who called her rigidity religion and her liver love
these people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment as a matter of course they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness
towards mr_matthew_pocket as a grown up infant with no notion of his own interests they showed the complacent forbearance i had heard them express
mrs_pocket they held in contempt but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves
i soon contracted expensive habits and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months i should have thought almost fabulous but through good and evil i stuck to my book
these were the surroundings among which i settled down and applied myself to my education there was no other merit in this than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies
i got on fast and with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start i wanted and clear obstructions out of my road i must have been as great a dolt as mr_drummle if i had done less
i had not seen mr_wemmick for some weeks when i thought i would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening
he replied that it would give him much pleasure and that he would expect me at the office at six clock
thither i went and there i found him putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck
between mr_matthew_pocket and herbert_pocket did you think of walking down to walworth said he certainly said i if you approve
very much was mr_wemmick reply for i have had my leg under the desk all day and shall be glad to stretch them
now i ll tell you what i have got for supper mr_pip i have got a stewed steak which is of home
i think it tender because the master of the shop was a juryman in some case of ours the other day and we let him down easy
i reminded him of it when i bought the fowl and i said pick us out a good one old briton because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two we could easily have done it
preparation and a cold roast fowl which is from the cook shop he said to that let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop
i let him of course as far as it goes it property and portable you dont object to an aged parent i hope
i really thought he was still speaking of the fowl until he added because i have got an aged parent at my place
i then said what politeness required so you havent dined with mr_jaggers yet he pursued as we walked along
not yet he told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming i expect you ll have an invitation to morrow
he going to ask your pals too three of em aint there although i was not in the habit of counting mr_drummle as one of my intimate associates i answered yes
well he going to ask the whole gang i hardly felt complimented by the word and whatever he gives you he ll give you good
and there another rum thing in his house proceeded mr_wemmick after a moment pause as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood he never lets a door or window be fastened at night
dont look forward to variety but you ll have excellence is he never robbed that it returned mr_wemmick
i have heard him a hundred time if i have heard him once say to regular cracksmen in our front office you know where i live now no bolt is ever drawn there why dont you do a stroke of business with me
he says and gives it out publicly i want to see the man who ll rob me lord bless you come
cant i tempt you not a man of them sir would be bold enough to try it on for love or money
they dread him so much said i dread him said mr_wemmick i believe you they dread him not but what he artful even in his defiance of them
no silver sir britannia metal every spoon so they wouldnt have much i observed even if they ah
but he would have much said mr_wemmick cutting me short and they know it he have their life and the life of scores of em
he have all he could get and it impossible to say what he couldnt get if he gave his mind to it
i was falling into meditation on my guardian greatness when mr_wemmick remarked as to the absence of plate that only his natural depth you know
a river its natural depth and he his natural depth look at his watch chain that real enough it very massive said i massive
repeated mr_wemmick i think so and his watch is a gold repeater and worth a hundred pound if it worth a penny
mr_pip there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch there not a man a woman or a child among them who wouldnt identify the smallest link in that chain and drop it as if it was red hot if inveigled into touching it
at first with such discourse and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature did mr_wemmick and i beguile the time and the road until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of walworth
it appeared to be a collection of back lanes ditches and little gardens and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement
mr_wemmick house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns
i highly commended it i think it was the smallest house i ever saw with the queerest gothic window by far the greater part of them sham and a gothic door almost too small to get in at
my own doing said mr_wemmick look pretty dont it that a real flagstaff you see said mr_wemmick and on sundays i run up a real flag
then look here after i have crossed this bridge i hoist it up so and cut off the communication the bridge was a plank and it crossed a chasm about four foot wide and two deep
but it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast smiling as he did so with a relish and not merely mechanically
at nine clock every night greenwich time said mr_wemmick the gun fire there he is you see and when you hear him go i think you ll say he a stinger
the piece of ordnance referred to was mounted in a separate fortress constructed of lattice work it was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella
it a principle with me if you have an idea carry it out and keep it up i dont know whether that your opinion i said decidedly
then at the back said mr_wemmick out of sight so as not to impede the idea of fortifications for at
then i knock together my own little frame you see and grow cucumbers and you ll judge at supper what sort of a salad i can raise
so sir said mr_wemmick smiling again but seriously too as he shook his head if you can suppose the little place besieged it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions
then he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth
the back there a pig and there are fowls and rabbits our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake on whose margin the bower was raised
this piece of water with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper was of a circular form and he had constructed a fountain in it which when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet
i am my own engineer and my own carpenter and my own plumber and my own gardener and my own jack of all trades said mr_wemmick in acknowledging my compliments
well it a good thing you know it brushes the newgate cobwebs away and pleases the aged you wouldnt mind being at once introduced to the aged would you
there we found sitting by a fire a very old man in a flannel coat clean cheerful comfortable and well cared for but intensely deaf
it wouldnt put you out i expressed the readiness i felt and we went into the castle well aged parent said mr_wemmick shaking hand with him in a cordial and jocose way how am you
all right john all right replied the old man here mr_pip aged parent said mr_wemmick and i wish you could hear his name
this is a fine place of my son sir cried the old man while i nodded as hard as i possibly could
nod away at him mr_pip that what he likes nod away at him if you please like winking
this spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the nation after my son time for the people enjoyment
said mr_wemmick contemplating the old man with his hard face really softened there a nod for you giving him a tremendous one there another for you giving him a still more tremendous one you like that dont you
this is a pretty pleasure ground sir you re as proud of it as punch aint you aged if you re not tired mr_pip though i know it tiring to strangers will you tip him one more
we left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls and we sat down to our punch in the arbor where mr_wemmick told me as he smoked a pipe that it had taken him a good many year to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection
you cant think how it pleases him i tipped him several more and he was in great spirits is it your own mr_wemmick
yes said mr_wemmick i have got hold of it a bit at a time it a freehold by george is it indeed
i hope mr_jaggers admires it never seen it said mr_wemmick never heard of it never seen the aged never heard of him
when i go into the office i leave the castle behind me and when i come into the castle i leave the office behind me
no the office is one thing and private life is another if it not in any way disagreeable to you you ll oblige me by doing the same
i dont wish it professionally spoken about of course i felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request
the punch being very nice we sat there drinking it and talking until it was almost nine clock getting near gun fire said mr_wemmick then as he laid down his pipe it the aged treat
proceeding into the castle again we found the aged heating the poker with expectant eye as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony
mr_wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the moment was come for him to take the red hot poker from the aged and repair to the battery
he took it and went out and presently the stinger went off with a bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces and made every glass and teacup in it ring
upon this the aged who i believe would have been blown out of his arm chair but for holding on by the elbows cried out exultingly he fired
and i nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that i absolutely could not see him
they were mostly of a felonious character comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed a distinguished razor or two some locks of hair and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation upon which mr_wemmick set particular value as being to use his own word every one of em lies sir
i heerd him the interval between that time and supper mr_wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities
these were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum and some tobacco stoppers carved by the aged
they were all displayed in that chamber of the castle into which i had been first inducted and which served not only as the general sitting room but as the kitchen too if i might judge from a saucepan on the hob and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting jack
when she had laid the supper cloth the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress and she withdrew for the night
the supper was excellent and though the castle was rather subject to dry rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut and though the pig might have been farther off i was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment
nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff that when i lay down on my back in bed it seemed as if i had to balance that pole on my forehead all night
there was a neat little girl in attendance who looked after the aged in the day mr_wemmick was up early in the morning and i am afraid i heard him cleaning my boots
after that he fell to gardening and i saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the aged and nodding at him in a most devoted manner
our breakfast was as good as the supper and at half past eight precisely we started for little britain by degrees mr_wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along and his mouth tightened into a post office again
and he pulled out his key from his coat collar he looked as unconscious of his walworth property as if the castle and the drawbridge and the arbor and the lake and the fountain and the aged had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the stinger
it fell out as mr_wemmick had told me it would that i had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian establishment with that of his cashier and clerk
my guardian was in his room washing his hand with his scented soap when i went into the office from walworth and he called me to him and gave me the invitation for myself and friend which mr_wemmick had prepared me to receive
at last when we got to his place of business chapter xxvi no ceremony he stipulated and no dinner dress and say to morrow
i asked him where we should come to for i had no idea where he lived and i believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission that he replied come here and
i embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off as if he were a surgeon or a dentist
he had a closet in his room fitted up for the purpose which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer shop
it had an unusually large jack towel on a roller inside the door and he would wash his hand and wipe them and dry them all over this towel whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room
when i and my friend repaired to him at six clock next day he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual for we found him with his head butted into this closet not only washing his hand but laving his face and gargling his throat
and even when he had done all that and had gone all round the jack towel he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on
there were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street who were evidently anxious to speak with him but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence that they gave it up for that day
as we walked along westward he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets and whenever that happened he talked louder to me but he never otherwise recognized anybody or took notice that anybody recognized him
i ll take you home with me he conducted us to gerrard street soho to a house on the south side of that street
he took out his key and opened the door and we all went into a stone hall bare gloomy and little used
rather a stately house of its kind but dolefully in want of painting and with dirty window so up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown room on the first floor
there were carved garlands on the panelled wall and as he stood among them giving us welcome i know what kind of loops i thought they looked like
dinner was laid in the best of these room the second was his dressing room the third his bedroom he told us that he held the whole house but rarely used more of it than we saw
the table was comfortably laid no silver in the service of course and at the side of his chair was a capacious dumb waiter with a variety of bottles and decanters on it and four dishes of fruit for dessert
there was a bookcase in the room i saw from the back of the book that they were about evidence criminal law criminal biography trials acts of parliament and such thing
i noticed throughout that he kept everything under his own hand and distributed everything himself the furniture was all very solid and good like his watch chain
in a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work
it had an official look however and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen as he had scarcely seen my three companions until now for he and i had walked
together he stood on the hearth rug after ringing the bell and took a searching look at them to my surprise he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in mr_drummle
mr_pip said he putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window i dont know one from the other
who the spider the spider said i the blotchy sprawly sulky fellow that mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle i replied the one with the delicate face is startop
not making the least account of the one with the delicate face he returned mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle is his name is it
he immediately began to talk to mr_drummle not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him
i was looking at the two when there came between me and them the housekeeper with the first dish for the table
i like the look of that fellow she was a woman of about forty i supposed but i may have thought her younger than she was
i cannot say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter but i know that i had been to see macbeth at the theatre a night or two before and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air like the face i had seen rise out of the witches caldron
she set the dish on touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready and vanished
we took our seats at the round table and my guardian kept mr_drummle on one side of him while startop sat on the other
it was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards and then an equally choice bird
sauces wines all the accessories we wanted and all of the best were given out by our host from his dumb waiter and when they had made the circuit of the table he always put them back again
similarly he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks for each course and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair
rather tall of a lithe nimble figure extremely pale with large faded eye and a quantity of streaming hair no other attendant than the housekeeper appeared
year afterwards i made a dreadful likeness of that woman by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room
induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper both by her own striking appearance and by mr_wemmick preparation i observed that whenever she was in the room she kept her eye attentively on my guardian and that she would remove her hand from any dish she put before him hesitatingly as if she dreaded his calling her back and wanted him to speak when she was nigh if he had anything to say
i fancied that i could detect in his manner a consciousness of this and a purpose of always holding her in suspense
dinner went off gayly and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subject i knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us
for myself i found that i was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure and to patronize herbert_pocket and to boast of my great prospects before i quite knew that i had opened my lips
it was so with all of us but with no one more than mr_drummle the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off
it was not then but when we had got to the cheese that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats and that mr_drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his
mr_drummle upon this informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company and that as to skill he was more than our master and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff
by some invisible agency my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was and we all fell to baring and spanning our arm in a ridiculous manner
now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table my guardian taking no heed of her but with the side of his face turned from her was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in mr_drummle that to me was quite inexplicable
she set on every dish and i always saw in her face a face rising out of the caldron suddenly he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper like a trap as she stretched it across the table
so suddenly and smartly did he do this that we all stopped in our foolish contention if you talk of strength said mr_jaggers i ll show you a wrist
molly let them see your wrist her entrapped hand was on the table but she had already put her other hand behind her waist
master she said in a low voice with her eye attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him dont i ll show you a wrist repeated mr_jaggers with an immovable determination to show it
molly said mr_jaggers not looking at her but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room let them see both your wrists
molly let them see your wrist master she again murmured please show them come he took his hand from hers and turned that wrist up on the table
she brought her other hand from behind her and held the two out side by side the last wrist was much disfigured deeply scarred and scarred across and across
when she held her hand out she took her eye from mr_jaggers and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession
there power here said mr_jaggers coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger very few man have the power of wrist that this woman has
i have had occasion to notice many hand but i never saw stronger in that respect man or woman than these
while he said these word in a leisurely critical style she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat
it remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hand the moment he ceased she looked at him again
she withdrew her hand and went out of the room and mr_jaggers putting the decanters on from his dumb waiter filled his glass and passed round the wine
that ll do molly said mr_jaggers giving her a slight nod you have been admired and can go
at half past nine gentleman said he we must break up pray make the best use of your time i am glad to see you all
mr_drummle i drink to you if his object in singling out mr_drummle were to bring him out still more it perfectly succeeded
in a sulky triumph mr_drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us in a more and more offensive degree until he became downright intolerable
through all his stages mr_jaggers followed him with the same strange interest he actually seemed to serve as a zest to mr_jaggers wine
in our boyish want of discretion i dare say we took too much to drink and i know we talked too much
we became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of mr_drummle to the effect that we were too free with our money
it led to my remarking with more zeal than discretion that it came with a bad grace from him to whom startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before
i dont mean to imply that he wont said i but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money i should think
i dare say i went on meaning to be very severe that you wouldnt lend money to any of us if we wanted it
well retorted mr_drummle he ll be paid you should think retorted mr_drummle oh lord you are right said mr_drummle
i wouldnt lend one of you a sixpence i wouldnt lend anybody a sixpence rather mean to borrow under those circumstance i should say
this was so very aggravating the more especially as i found myself making no way against his surly obtuseness that i said disregarding herbert_pocket efforts to check me
come mr_drummle since we are on the subject i ll tell you what passed between herbert_pocket here and me when you borrowed that money
you should say repeated mr_drummle oh lord i dont want to know what passed between herbert_pocket there and you growled mr_drummle
and i think he added in a lower growl that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves
we said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it you seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it
mr_drummle laughed outright and sat laughing in our face with his hand in his pocket and his round shoulder raised plainly signifying that it was quite true and that he despised us as asses all
hereupon startop took him in hand though with a much better grace than i had shown and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable
startop being a lively bright young fellow and mr_drummle being the exact opposite the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront
he now retorted in a coarse lumpish way and startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh
resenting this little success more than anything mr_drummle without any threat or warning pulled his hand out of his pocket dropped his round shoulder swore took up a large glass and would have flung it at his adversary head but for our entertainer dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose
gentleman said mr_jaggers deliberately putting down the glass and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain i am exceedingly sorry to announce that it half past nine
i ll tell you however said i whether you want to know or not on this hint we all rose to depart
but the old boy was so far from responding that he would not even walk to hammersmith on the same side of the way so herbert_pocket and i who remained in town saw them going down the street on opposite side startop leading and mr_drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the house much as he was wont to follow in his boat
as the door was not yet shut i thought i would leave herbert_pocket there for a moment and run upstairs again to say a word to my guardian
i found him in his dressing room surrounded by his stock of boots already hard at it washing his hand of us
i told him i had come up again to say how sorry i was that anything disagreeable should have occurred and that i hoped he would not blame me much
before we got to the street door startop was cheerily calling mr_drummle old boy as if nothing had happened pooh said he sluicing his face and speaking through the water drops it nothing mr_pip
i like that spider though he had turned towards me now and was shaking his head and blowing and towelling himself
i am glad you like him sir said i but i dont no no my guardian assented dont have too much to do with him
keep as clear of him as you can but i like the fellow mr_pip he is one of the true sort
but i am not a fortune teller he said letting his head drop into a festoon of towel and towelling away at his two ears
why if i was a fortune teller looking out of the towel he caught my eye you know what i am dont you
in about a month after that the spider time with mr_matthew_pocket was up for good and to the great relief of all the house but
good night mr_pip good night sir mrs_pocket he went home to the family hole chapter xxvii my dear mr
i write this by request of mr mrs_joe_gargery for to let you know that he is going to london in company with mr_wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you
mr_pip he would call at barnard hotel tuesday morning at nine clock when if not agreeable please leave word your poor sister is much the same as when you left
we talk of you in the kitchen every night and wonder what you are saying and doing if now considered in the light of a liberty excuse it for the love of poor old day
no more dear mr_pip from your ever obliged and affectionate servant biddy s he wishes me most particular to write what larks
i hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him even though a gentleman for you had ever a good heart and he is a worthy worthy man
i have read him all excepting only the last little sentence and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks
he says you will understand i received this letter by the post on monday morning and therefore its appointment was for next day
not with pleasure though i was bound to him by so many ties no with considerable disturbance some mortification and a keen sense of incongruity
let me confess exactly with what feelings i looked forward to mrs_joe_gargery coming if i could have kept him away by paying money i certainly would have paid money
my greatest reassurance was that he was coming to barnard inn not to hammersmith and consequently would not fall in mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle way
i had little objection to his being seen by herbert_pocket or his father for both of whom i had a respect but i had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by mr_drummle whom i held in contempt
so throughout life our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise
i had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other and very expensive those wrestles with barnard proved to be
by this time the room were vastly different from what i had found them and i enjoyed the honor of occupying a few prominent pages in the book of a neighboring upholsterer
i had got on so fast of late that i had even started a boy in boots top boots in bondage and slavery to whom i might have been said to pass my day
for after i had made the monster out of the refuse of my washerwoman family and had clothed him with a blue coat canary waistcoat white cravat creamy breeches and the boots already mentioned i had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my existence
this avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on tuesday morning in the hall it was two foot square as charged for floorcloth and herbert_pocket suggested certain thing for breakfast that he thought mrs_joe_gargery would like
while i felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate i had an odd half provoked sense of suspicion upon me that if mrs_joe_gargery had been coming to see him he wouldnt have been quite so brisk about it
however i came into town on the monday night to be ready for mrs_joe_gargery and i got up early in the morning and caused the sitting room and breakfast table to assume their most splendid appearance
unfortunately the morning was drizzly and an angel could not have concealed the fact that barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window like some weak giant of a sweep
as the time approached i should have liked to run away but the avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall and presently i heard mrs_joe_gargery on the staircase
i knew it was mrs_joe_gargery by his clumsy manner of coming upstairs his state boots being always too big for him and by the time it took him to read the name on the other floors in the course of his ascent
when at last he stopped outside our door i could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name and i afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole
i thought he never would have done wiping his foot and that i must have gone out to lift him off the mat but at last he came in
finally he gave a faint single rap and pepper such was the compromising name of the avenging boy announced mr mrs_joe_gargery
with his good honest face all glowing and shining and his hat put down on the floor between us he caught both my hand and worked them straight up and down as if i had been the last patented pump
mrs_joe_gargery how are you mrs_joe_gargery mr_pip how air you mr_pip i am glad to see you mrs_joe_gargery give me your hat
but mrs_joe_gargery taking it up carefully with both hand like a bird nest with eggs in it wouldnt hear of parting with that piece of property and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way
mrs_joe_gargery considered a little before he discovered this word as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country
which you have that growed said mrs_joe_gargery and that swelled and that gentle folked and you mrs_joe_gargery look wonderfully well
thank god said mrs_joe_gargery i ekerval to most and your sister she no worse than she were and biddy she ever right and ready
all this time still with both hand taking great care of the bird nest mrs_joe_gargery was rolling his eye round and round the room and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing gown
and all friend is no backerder if not no forarder ceptin mr_wopsle he had a drop had a drop mrs_joe_gargery
why yes said mrs_joe_gargery lowering his voice he left the church and went into the playacting which the playacting have likeways brought him to london along with me
and his wish were said mrs_joe_gargery getting the bird nest under his left arm for the moment and groping in it for an egg with his right if no offence as i would and you that
i took what mrs_joe_gargery gave me and found it to be the crumpled play bill_barley of a small metropolitan theatre announcing the first appearance in that very week of the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our national bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles
were you at his performance mrs_joe_gargery i inquired i were said mrs_joe_gargery with emphasis and solemnity was there a great sensation
though i put it to yourself sir whether it were calc lated to keep a man up to his work with a good hart to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the ghost with amen
a man may have had a misfortun and been in the church said mrs_joe_gargery lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone but that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time
which i meantersay if the ghost of a man own father cannot be allowed to claim his attention what can sir
still more when his mourning at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off try to keep it on how you may
why said mrs_joe_gargery yes there certainly were a peck of orange peel partickler when he see the ghost a ghost seeing effect in mrs_joe_gargery own countenance informed me that herbert_pocket had entered the room
so i presented mrs_joe_gargery to herbert_pocket who held out his hand but mrs_joe_gargery backed from it and held on by the bird nest
your servant sir said mrs_joe_gargery which i hope as you and mr_pip here his eye fell on the avenger who was putting some toast on table and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family that i frowned it down and confused him more i meantersay you two gentleman which
for the present may be a werry good inn according to london opinions said mrs_joe_gargery confidentially and i believe its character do stand it but i wouldnt keep a pig in it
i hope as you get your elths in this close spot myself not in the case that i wished him to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him
having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling place and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me sir mrs_joe_gargery being invited to sit down to table looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting place and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimney piece from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals
do you take tea or coffee mr mrs_joe_gargery asked herbert_pocket who always presided of a morning thankee sir said mrs_joe_gargery stiff from head to foot i ll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself
thankee sir returned mrs_joe_gargery evidently dispirited by the proposal since you are so kind as make chice of coffee i will not run contrairy to your own opinions
what do you say to coffee but dont you never find it a little eating say tea then said herbert_pocket pouring it out
here mrs_joe_gargery hat tumbled off the mantel piece and he started out of his chair and picked it up and fitted it to the same exact spot
as if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon when did you come to town mr mrs_joe_gargery
were it yesterday afternoon said mrs_joe_gargery after coughing behind his hand as if he had had time to catch the whooping cough since he came
no it were not yes it were yes it were yesterday afternoon with an appearance of mingled wisdom relief and strict impartiality
have you seen anything of london yet why yes sir said mrs_joe_gargery me and mr_wopsle went off straight to look at the blacking ware us
but we didnt find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop door which i meantersay added mrs_joe_gargery in an explanatory manner as it is there drawd too architectooralooral
i really believe mrs_joe_gargery would have prolonged this word mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that i know into a perfect chorus but for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat which was toppling
indeed it demanded from him a constant attention and a quickness of eye and hand very like that exacted by wicket keeping
he made extraordinary play with it and showed the greatest skill now rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped now merely stopping it midway beating it up and humoring it in various part of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall before he felt it safe to close with it finally splashing it into the slop basin where i took the liberty of laying hand upon it
as to his shirt collar and his coat collar they were perplexing to reflect upon insoluble mysteries both why should a man scrape himself to that extent before he could consider himself full dressed
then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth had his eye attracted in such strange directions was afflicted with such remarkable coughs sat so far from the table and dropped so much more than he ate and pretended that he hadnt dropped it that i was heartily glad when herbert_pocket left us for the city
i had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault and that if i had been easier with mrs_joe_gargery joe would have been easier with me
i felt impatient of him and out of temper with him in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head
why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes us two being now alone sir began mrs_joe_gargery
mrs_joe_gargery i interrupted pettishly how can you call me sir mrs_joe_gargery looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach
utterly preposterous as his cravat was and as his collars were i was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look
us two being now alone resumed mrs_joe_gargery and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more i will now conclude leastways begin to mention what have led to my having had the present honor
for was it not said mrs_joe_gargery with his old air of lucid exposition that my only wish were to be useful to you i should not have had the honor of breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentleman
i was so unwilling to see the look again that i made no remonstrance against this tone well sir pursued mrs_joe_gargery this is how it were
i were at the bargement other night mr_pip whenever he subsided into affection he called me mr_pip and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir when there come up in his shay cart mr_pumblechook
which that same identical said mrs_joe_gargery going down a new track do comb my air the wrong way sometimes awful by giving out up and down town as it were him which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow by yourself
nonsense it was you mrs_joe_gargery which i fully believed it were mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery slightly tossing his head though it signify little now sir
a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the workingman sir and do not over stimilate and his word were joseph_gargery miss_havisham she wish to speak to you
well mr_pip this same identical which his manner is given to blusterous come to me at the bargemen wot miss_havisham mrs_joe_gargery
she wish were mr_pumblechook word to speak to you mrs_joe_gargery sat and rolled his eye at the ceiling yes mrs_joe_gargery
go on please next day sir said mrs_joe_gargery looking at me as if i were a long way off having cleaned myself i go and i see miss a
which i say sir replied mrs_joe_gargery with an air of legal formality as if he were making his will miss a or otherways havisham
miss a mrs_joe_gargery miss_havisham her expression air then as follering mr mrs_joe_gargery you air in correspondence with mr_pip
when i married your sister sir i said i will and when i answered your friend mr_pip i said i am would you tell him then said she that which miss_estella has come home and would be glad to see him
having had a letter from you i were able to say i am i felt my face fire up as i looked at mrs_joe_gargery
i hope one remote cause of its firing may have been my consciousness that if i had known his errand i should have given him more encouragement
biddy pursued mrs_joe_gargery when i got home and asked her fur to write the message to you a little hung back
biddy says i know he will be very glad to have it by word of mouth it is holiday time you want to see him go
i have now concluded sir said mrs_joe_gargery rising from his chair and mr_pip i wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a greater height
but you are not going now mrs_joe_gargery yes i am said mrs_joe_gargery but you are coming back to dinner mrs_joe_gargery
no i am not said mrs_joe_gargery our eye met and all the sir melted out of that manly heart as he gave me his hand
mr_pip dear old chap life is made of ever so many partings welded together as i may say and one man a blacksmith and one a whitesmith and one a goldsmith and one a coppersmith
diwisions among such must come and must be met as they come if there been any fault at all to day it mine
you and me is not two figures to be together in london nor yet anywheres else but what is private and beknown and understood among friend
it aint that i am proud but that i want to be right as you shall never see me no more in these clothes
you wont find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress with my hammer in my hand or even my pipe
you wont find half so much fault in me if supposing as you should ever wish to see me you come and put your head in at the forge window and see mrs_joe_gargery the blacksmith there at the old anvil in the old burnt apron sticking to the old work
i wrong in these clothes i wrong out of the forge the kitchen or off th meshes i awful dull but i hope i ve beat out something nigh the rights of this at last
and so god bless you dear old mr_pip old chap god bless you i had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him
the fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these word than it could come in its way in heaven
as soon as i could recover myself sufficiently i hurried out after him and looked for him in the neighboring streets but he was gone
chapter xxviii it was clear that i must repair to our town next day and in the first flow of my repentance it was equally clear that i must stay at mrs_joe_gargery
but when i had secured my box place by to morrow coach and had been down to mr_matthew_pocket and back i was not by any means convinced on the last point and began to invent reason and make excuses for putting up at the blue_boar
i should be an inconvenience at mrs_joe_gargery i was not expected and my bed would not be ready i should be too far from miss_havisham and she was exacting and mightnt like it
he touched me gently on the forehead and went out all other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self swindlers and with such pretences did i cheat myself
that i should innocently take a bad half crown of somebody else manufacture is reasonable enough but that i should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money
an obliging stranger under pretence of compactly folding up my bank notes for security sake abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells but what is his sleight of hand to mine when i fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes
having settled that i must go to the blue_boar my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the avenger
it was tempting to think of that expensive mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the blue_boar posting yard it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor shop and confounding the disrespectful senses of mr_trabb boy
on the other hand mr_trabb boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him thing or reckless and desperate wretch as i knew he could be might hoot him in the high street
surely a curious thing my patroness too might hear of him and not approve on the whole i resolved to leave the avenger behind
it was the afternoon coach by which i had taken my place and as winter had now come round i should not arrive at my destination until two or three hour after dark
our time of starting from the cross keys was two clock i arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare attended by the avenger if
i may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it at that time it was customary to carry convict down to the dock yards by stage coach
as i had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed leg over the coach roof i had no cause to be surprised when herbert_pocket meeting me in the yard came up and told me there were two convict going down with me
but i had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever i heard the word convict
you dont mind them handel said herbert_pocket no i thought you seemed as if you didnt like them i cant pretend that i do like them and i suppose you dont particularly
but i dont mind them see there they are said herbert_pocket coming out of the tap what a degraded and vile sight it is
they had been treating their guard i suppose for they had a gaoler with them and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hand
the two convict were handcuffed together and had irons on their leg irons of a pattern that i knew well they wore the dress that i likewise knew well
their keeper had a brace of pistols and carried a thick knobbed bludgeon under his arm but he was on terms of good understanding with them and stood with them beside him looking on at the putting to of the horses rather with an air as if the convict were an interesting exhibition not formally open at the moment and he the curator
one was a taller and stouter man than the other and appeared as a matter of course according to the mysterious way of the world both convict and free to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes
his arm and leg were like great pincushions of those shapes and his attire disguised him absurdly but i knew his half closed eye at one glance
there stood the man whom i had seen on the settle at the three jolly_bargemen on a saturday night and who had brought me down with his invisible gun
it was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life
he looked across at me and his eye appraised my watch chain and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle and looked at something else
the great numbers on their back as if they were street door their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface as if they were lower animals their ironed leg apologetically garlanded with pocket handkerchiefs and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them made them as herbert_pocket had said a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle
it came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from london and that there were no place for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman
hereupon a choleric gentleman who had taken the fourth place on that seat flew into a most violent passion and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company and that it was poisonous and pernicious and infamous and shameful and i dont know what else
at this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient and we were all preparing to get up and the prisoners had come over with their keeper bringing with them that curious flavor of bread poultice baize rope yarn and hearthstone which attends the convict presence
but this was not the worst of it dont take it so much amiss sir pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger i ll sit next you myself
i ll put em on the outside of the row they wont interfere with you sir you neednt know they re there
and dont blame me growled the convict i had recognized i dont want to go i am quite ready to stay behind
as fur as i am concerned any one welcome to my place or mine said the other gruffly i wouldnt have incommoded none of you if i had my way
then they both laughed and began cracking nuts and spitting the shells about as i really think i should have liked to do myself if i had been in their place and so despised
at length it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind
so he got into his place still making complaints and the keeper got into the place next him and the convict hauled themselves up as well as they could and the convict i had recognized sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head
good bye handel herbert_pocket called out as we started i thought what a blessed fortune it was that he had found another name for me than mr_pip
it is impossible to express with what acuteness i felt the convict breathing not only on the back of my head but all along my spine
the sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid it set my very teeth on edge
he seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man and to make more noise in doing it and i was conscious of growing high shouldered on one side in my shrinking endeavors to fend him off
it made us all lethargic before we had gone far and when we had left the half way house behind we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent
i dozed off myself in considering the question whether i ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him and how it could best be done
in the act of dipping forward as if i were going to bathe among the horses i woke in a fright and took the question up again
but i must have lost it longer than i had thought since although i could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful light and shadows of our lamps i traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us
cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind the convict were closer to me than before
the very first word i heard them interchange as i became conscious were the word of my own thought two one pound notes
the weather was miserably raw and the two cursed the cold how did he get em said the convict i had never seen
how should i know returned the other he had em stowed away somehows giv him by friend i expect
i wish said the other with a bitter curse upon the cold that i had em here two one pound notes or friend
two one pound notes i sell all the friend i ever had for one and think it a blessed good bargain
so he says resumed the convict i had recognized it was all said and done in half a minute behind a pile of timber in the dock yard you re
would i find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret and give him them two one pound notes
well so he says a going to be discharged yes i was yes i would and i did
more fool you growled the other i have spent em on a man in wittles and drink he must have been a green one
mean to say he knowed nothing of you not a ha porth different gangs and different ships he was tried again for prison breaking and got made a lifer
and was that honor the only time you worked out in this part of the country the only time what might have been your opinion of the place
a most beastly place mudbank mist swamp and work work swamp mist and mudbank they both execrated the place in very strong language and gradually growled themselves out and had nothing left to say
after overhearing this dialogue i should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity
indeed i was not only so changed in the course of nature but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help
still the coincidence of our being together on the coach was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me in his hearing with my name
for this reason i resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town and put myself out of his hearing
my little portmanteau was in the boot under my foot i had but to turn a hinge to get it out i threw it down before me got down after it and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement
as to the convict they went their way with the coach and i knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river
in my fancy i saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime washed stairs again heard the gruff give way you
this device i executed successfully like and order to dogs again saw the wicked noah ark lying out on the black water
i could not have said what i was afraid of for my fear was altogether undefined and vague but there was great fear upon me
as i walked on to the hotel i felt that a dread much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition made me tremble
i am confident that it took no distinctness of shape and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood
the coffee room at the blue_boar was empty and i had not only ordered my dinner there but had sat down to it before the waiter knew me
as soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory he asked me if he should send boots for mr_pumblechook
the waiter it was he who had brought up the great remonstrance from the commercials on the day when i was bound appeared surprised and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way that i took it up and read this paragraph our readers will learn not altogether without interest in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighborhood what a theme by the way for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman tooby the poet of our columns that the youth earliest patron companion and friend was a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the high street
it is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record him as the mentor of our young telemachus for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter fortunes
no said i certainly not does the thought contracted brow of the local sage or the lustrous eye of local beauty inquire whose fortunes
i entertain a conviction based upon large experience that if in the day of my prosperity i had gone to the north pole i should have met somebody there wandering esquimaux or civilized man who would have told me that mr_pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes
we believe that quintin matsys was the blacksmith of antwerp verb sap chapter xxix betimes in the morning i was up and out
it was too early yet to go to miss_havisham so i loitered into the country on miss_havisham side of town which
was not mrs_joe_gargery side i could go there to morrow thinking about my patroness and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for me
she had adopted miss_estella she had as good as adopted me and it could not fail to be her intention to bring us together
she reserved it for me to restore the desolate house admit the sunshine into the dark room set the clocks a going and the cold hearths
a blazing tear down the cobwebs destroy the vermin in short do all the shining deeds of the young knight of romance and marry the princess
i had stopped to look at the house as i passed and its seared red brick wall blocked window and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons as if with sinewy old arm had made up a rich attractive mystery of which i was the hero
but though she had taken such strong possession of me though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her though her influence on my boyish life and character had been all powerful i did not even that romantic morning invest her with any attributes save those she possessed
i mention this in this place of a fixed purpose because it is the clew by which i am to be followed into my poor labyrinth
miss_estella was the inspiration of it and the heart of it of course according to my experience the conventional notion of a lover cannot be always true
the unqualified truth is that when i loved miss_estella with the love of a man i loved her simply because i found her irresistible
once for all i knew to my sorrow often and often if not always that i loved her against reason against promise against peace against hope against happiness against all discouragement that could be
once for all i loved her none the less because i knew it and it had no more influence in restraining me than if i had devoutly believed her to be human perfection
when i had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand i turned my back upon the gate while i tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet
i heard the side door open and steps come across the courtyard but i pretended not to hear even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges
i so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time being at last touched on the shoulder i started and turned
i started much more naturally then to find myself confronted by a man in a sober gray dress the last man i should have expected to see in that place of porter at miss_havisham door
old_orlick ah young master there more changes than yours but come in come in it opposed to my orders to hold the gate open
i entered and he swung it and locked it and took the key out yes said he facing round after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house
here i am how did you come here i come her he retorted on my leg i had my box brought alongside me in a barrow
are you here for good i aint here for harm young master i suppose i was not so sure of that
i had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement up my leg and arm to my face
then you have left the forge i said do this look like a forge replied old_orlick sending his glance all round him with an air of injury
now do it look like it i asked him how long he had left mrs_joe_gargery forge one day is so like another here he replied that i dont know without casting it up
however i come here some time since you left i could have told you that old_orlick ah said he dryly
by this time we had come to the house where i found his room to be one just within the side door with a little window in it looking on the courtyard
but then you ve got to be a scholar in its small proportions it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate porter in paris
certain keys were hanging on the wall to which he now added the gate key and his patchwork covered bed was in a little inner division or recess
the whole had a slovenly confined and sleepy look like a cage for a human dormouse while he looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up as indeed he was
no said he not till it got about that there was no protection on the premises and it come to be considered dangerous with convict and tag and rag and bobtail going up and down
and then i was recommended to the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought and i took it
i never saw this room before i remarked but there used to be no porter here it easier than bellowsing and hammering that loaded that is
my eye had been caught by a gun with a brass bound stock over the chimney piece and his eye had followed mine
well said i not desirous of more conversation shall i go up to miss_havisham burn me if i know
i give this here bell a rap with this here hammer and you go on along the passage till you meet somebody
he retorted first stretching himself and then shaking himself my orders ends here young master i am expected i believe burn me twice over if i can say said he
upon that i turned down the long passage which i had first trodden in my thick boots and he made his bell sound
at the end of the passage while the bell was still reverberating i found miss_sarah_pocket who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me
oh said she you is it mr_pip it is miss pocket i am glad to tell you that mr_matthew_pocket and family are all well
are they any wiser said miss_sarah_pocket with a dismal shake of the head they had better be wiser than well
ah mr_matthew_pocket matthew you know your way sir tolerably for i had gone up the staircase in the dark many a time
i ascended it now in lighter boots than of yore and tapped in my old way at the door of miss_havisham room
she was in her chair near the old table in the old dress with her two hand crossed on her stick her chin resting on them and her eye on the fire
sitting near her with the white shoe that had never been worn in her hand and her head bent as she looked at it was an elegant lady whom i had never seen
come in mr_pip miss_havisham continued to mutter without looking round or up come in mr_pip how do you do mr_pip
mr_pip rap i heard her say immediately come in mr_pip so you kiss my hand as if i were a queen eh well
i heard miss_havisham said i rather at a loss that you were so kind as to wish me to come and see you and i came directly
she looked up at me suddenly only moving her eye and repeated in a grimly playful manner well well
the lady whom i had never seen before lifted up her eye and looked archly at me and then i saw that the eye were miss_estella eye
but she was so much changed was so much more beautiful so much more womanly in all thing winning admiration had made such wonderful advance that i seemed to have made none
i fancied as i looked at her that i slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me and the inaccessibility that came about her
i stammered something about the pleasure i felt in seeing her again and about my having looked forward to it for a long long time
do you find her much changed mr_pip asked miss_havisham with her greedy look and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between them as a sign to me to sit down there
when i came in miss_havisham i thought there was nothing of miss_estella in the face or figure but now it all settles down so curiously into the old
she gave me her hand what you are not going to say into the old miss_estella miss_havisham interrupted
she was proud and insulting and you wanted to go away from her dont you remember i said confusedly that that was long ago and that i knew no better then and the like
miss_estella smiled with perfect composure and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right and of her having been very disagreeable
is he changed miss_havisham asked her very much said miss_estella looking at me less coarse and common said miss_havisham playing with miss_estella hair
miss_estella laughed and looked at the shoe in her hand and laughed again and looked at me and put the shoe down
we sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me and i learnt that she had but just come home from france and that she was going to london
proud and wilful as of old she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of nature or i thought so to separate them from her beauty
truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood from all those ill regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and mrs_joe_gargery from all those visions that had raised her face in the glowing fire struck it out of the iron on the anvil extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge and flit away
in a word it was impossible for me to separate her in the past or in the present from the innermost life of my life
it was settled that i should stay there all the rest of the day and return to the hotel at night and to london to morrow
when we had conversed for a while miss_havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden on our coming in by and by she said i should wheel her about a little as in time of yore
so miss_estella and i went out into the garden by the gate through which i had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman now herbert_pocket
i trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress she quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine
she treated me as a boy still but she lured me on as we drew near to the place of encounter she stopped and said
i must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight that day but i did and i enjoyed it very much
i remember i entertained a great objection to your adversary because i took it ill that he should be brought here to pester me with his company
you rewarded me very much did i she replied in an incidental and forgetful way he and i are great friend now
i made the admission with reluctance for it seemed to have a boyish look and she already treated me more than enough like a boy
are you i think i recollect though that you read with his father yes since your change of fortune and prospects you have changed your companions said miss_estella
and necessarily she added in a haughty tone what was fit company for you once would be quite unfit company for you now
in my conscience i doubt very much whether i had any lingering intention left of going to see mrs_joe_gargery but if i had this observation put it to flight
you had no idea of your impending good fortune in those time said miss_estella with a slight wave of her hand signifying in the fighting time
the air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my side and the air of youthfulness and submission with which i walked at hers made a contrast that i strongly felt
it would have rankled in me more than it did if i had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for her and assigned to her
the garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice we came out again into the brewery yard
i showed her to a nicety where i had seen her walking on the casks that first old day and she said with a cold and careless look in that direction did i_
i reminded her where she had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink and she said i dont remember
naturally said i not the least not remember that you made me cry said i no said she and shook her head and looked about her
i verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least made me cry again inwardly and that is the sharpest crying of all
you must know said miss_estella condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might that i have no heart if that has anything to do with my memory
i got through some jargon to the effect that i took the liberty of doubting that that i knew better
that there could be no such beauty without it oh i have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in
i have no doubt said miss_estella and of course if it ceased to beat i should cease to be but you know what i mean
i have no softness there no sympathy sentiment nonsense what was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me
in some of her look and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance to miss_havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by child from grown person with whom they have been much associated and secluded and which when childhood is passed will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between face that are otherwise quite different
anything that i had seen in miss_havisham no and yet i could not trace this to miss_havisham i looked again and though she was still looking at me the suggestion was gone
i am serious said miss_estella not so much with a frown for her brow was smooth as with a darkening of her face if we are to be thrown much together you had better believe it at once
what was it no imperiously stopping me as i opened my lips i have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere
in another moment we were in the brewery so long disused and she pointed to the high gallery where i had seen her going out on that same first day and told me she remembered to have been up there and to have seen me standing scared below
i have never had any such thing as my eye followed her white hand again the same dim suggestion that i could not possibly grasp crossed me
my involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone
what was it what is the matter asked miss_estella are you scared again i should be if i believed what you said just now i replied to turn it off
miss_havisham will soon be expecting you at your old post though i think that might be laid aside now with other old belongings
then you dont very well it is said at any rate let us make one more round of the garden and then go in
come you shall not shed tears for my cruelty to day you shall be my page and give me your shoulder
her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground she held it in one hand now and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked
if the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance
there was no discrepancy of year between us to remove her far from me we were of nearly the same age though of course the age told for more in her case than in mine but the air of inaccessibility which her beauty and her manner gave her tormented me in the midst of my delight and at the height of the assurance i felt that our patroness had chosen us for one another
at last we went back into the house and there i heard with surprise that my guardian had come down to see miss_havisham on business and would come back to dinner
the old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out and miss_havisham was in her chair and waiting for me
it was like pushing the chair itself back into the past when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast
but in the funereal room with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eye upon her miss_estella looked more bright and beautiful than before and i was under stronger enchantment
we walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more and it was all in bloom for me wretched boy the time so melted away that our early dinner hour drew close at hand and miss_estella left us to prepare herself
we had stopped near the centre of the long table and miss_havisham with one of her withered arm stretched out of the chair rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth
as miss_estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door miss_havisham kissed that hand to her with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful
then miss_estella being gone and we two left alone she turned to me and said in a whisper is she beautiful graceful well grown
she drew an arm round my neck and drew my head close down to hers as she sat in the chair
do you admire her everybody must who sees her miss_havisham love her love her love her how does she use you
before i could answer if i could have answered so difficult a question at all she repeated love her love her love her
if she tears your heart to pieces and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper love her love her love her
if she favors you love her if she wounds you love her never had i seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her utterance of these word
i could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her hear me mr_pip
i adopted her to be loved i bred her and educated her to be loved i developed her into what she is that she might be loved
she said the word often enough and there could be no doubt that she meant to say it but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of love despair revenge
love her dire death it could not have sounded from her lips more like a curse i ll tell you said she in the same hurried passionate whisper what real love is
it is blind devotion unquestioning self humiliation utter submission trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter as i did
for she rose up in the chair in her shroud of a dress and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself against the wall and fallen dead
when she came to that and to a wild cry that followed that i caught her round the waist all this passed in a few seconds
as i drew her down into her chair i was conscious of a scent that i knew and turning saw my guardian in the room
he always carried i have not yet mentioned it i think a pocket handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions which was of great value to him in his profession
i have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket handkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose and then pausing as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself that the self committal has followed directly quite as a matter of course
when i saw him in the room he had this expressive pocket handkerchief in both hand and was looking at us on meeting my eye he said plainly by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude indeed
singular and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect miss_havisham had seen him as soon as i and was like everybody else afraid of him
she made a strong attempt to compose herself and stammered that he was as punctual as ever as punctual as ever he repeated coming up to us
how do you do mr_pip shall i give you a ride miss_havisham once round and so you are here mr_pip
i told him when i had arrived and how miss_havisham had wished me to come and see miss_estella to which he replied ah
then he pushed miss_havisham in her chair before him with one of his large hand and put the other in his trousers pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets
very fine young lady well mr_pip how often have you seen miss_estella before said he when he came to a stop
how often ah how many time ten thousand time oh certainly not so many twice mr_jaggers interposed miss_havisham much to my relief leave my mr_pip alone and go with him to your dinner
while we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back he asked me how often i had seen miss_havisham eat and drink offering me a breadth of choice as usual between a hundred time and once
he complied and we groped our way down the dark stairs together i considered and said never and never will mr_pip he retorted with a frowning smile
she has never allowed herself to be seen doing either since she lived this present life of hers she wanders about in the night and then lays hand on such food as she takes
pray sir said i may i ask you a question you may said he and i may decline to answer it
put your question miss_estella name is it havisham or i had nothing to add or what said he is it havisham
it is havisham this brought us to the dinner table where she and miss_sarah_pocket awaited us mr_jaggers presided miss_estella sat opposite to him i faced my green and yellow friend
we dined very well and were waited on by a maid servant whom i had never seen in all my comings and goings but who for anything i know had been in that mysterious house the whole time
after dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage and the two lady left us
anything to equal the determined reticence of mr_jaggers under that roof i never saw elsewhere even in him he kept his very look to himself and scarcely directed his eye to miss_estella face once during dinner
when she spoke to him he listened and in due course answered but never looked at her that i could see
on the other hand she often looked at him with interest and curiosity if not distrust but his face never showed the least consciousness
throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making miss_sarah_pocket greener and yellower by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations but here again he showed no consciousness and even made it appear that he extorted and even did extort though i dont know how those references out of my innocent self
and when he and i were left alone together he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed that really was too much for me
he held it between himself and the candle tasted the port rolled it in his mouth swallowed it looked at his glass again smelt the port tried it drank it filled again and cross examined the glass again until i was as nervous as if i had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage
three or four time i feebly thought i would start conversation but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything he looked at me with his glass in his hand and rolling his wine about in his mouth as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use for he couldnt answer
i think miss pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in the danger of being goaded to madness and perhaps tearing off her cap which was a very hideous one in the nature of a muslin mop and strewing the ground with her
he cross examined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand hair which assuredly had never grown on her head she did not appear when we afterwards went up to miss_havisham room and we four played at whist
in the interval miss_havisham in a fantastic way had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressing table into miss_estella hair and about her bosom and arm and i saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows and raise them a little when her loveliness was before him with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it
of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hand before which the glory of our kings and queens was utterly abased i say nothing nor of the feeling that i had respecting his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago
it was not that i knew i could never bear to speak to him about her that i knew i could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her that i knew i could never bear to see him wash his hand of her
it was that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him it was that my feelings should be in the same place with him that was the agonizing circumstance
we played until nine clock and then it was arranged that when miss_estella came to london i should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her at the coach and then i took leave of her and touched her and left her
what i suffered from was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards miss_estella my guardian lay at the boar in the next room to mine
i adapted them for my own repetition and said to my pillow i love her i love her i love her
far into the night miss_havisham word love her love her love her sounded in my ears hundreds of time
then i thought if she were as i feared by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet when would she begin to be interested in me
then a burst of gratitude came upon me that she should be destined for me once the blacksmith boy when should i awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now
but i never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from mrs_joe_gargery because i knew she would be contemptuous of him
it was but a day gone and mrs_joe_gargery had brought the tears into my eye they had soon dried god forgive me soon dried
after well considering the matter while i was dressing at the blue_boar in the morning i resolved to tell my guardian that i doubted old_orlick being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at miss_havisham
why of course he is not the right sort of man mr_pip said my guardian comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man
it seemed quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man and he listened in a satisfied manner while i told him what knowledge i had of old_orlick
ah me i thought those were high and great emotions chapter xxx very good mr_pip he observed when i had concluded i ll go round presently and pay our friend off
rather alarmed by this summary action i was for a little delay and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with
oh no he wont said my guardian making his pocket handkerchief point with perfect confidence i should like to see him argue the question with me
as we were going back together to london by the midday coach and as i breakfasted under such terrors of mr_pumblechook that i could scarcely hold my cup this gave me an opportunity of saying that i wanted a walk and that i would go on along the london road while mr_jaggers was occupied if he would let the coachman know that i would get into my place when overtaken
by then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of mr_pumblechook premises i got round into the high street again a little beyond that pitfall and felt myself in comparative security
it was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after
one or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me that they might turn as if they had forgotten something and pass me face to face on which occasion i dont know whether they or i made the worse pretence they of not doing it or i of not seeing it
still my position was a distinguished one and i was not at all dissatisfied with it until fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant mr_trabb boy
casting my eye along the street at a certain point of my progress i beheld mr_trabb boy approaching lashing himself with an empty blue bag
deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best beseem me and would be most likely to quell his evil mind i advanced with that expression of countenance and was rather congratulating myself on my success when suddenly the knees of mr_trabb boy smote together his hair uprose his cap fell off he trembled violently in every limb staggered out into the road and crying to the populace hold me
i was thus enabled to fly from the blue_boar immediately after breakfast i so frightened feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition occasioned by the dignity of my appearance
as i passed him his teeth loudly chattered in his head and with every mark of extreme humiliation he prostrated himself in the dust
i had not advanced another two hundred yards when to my inexpressible terror amazement and indignation i again beheld mr_trabb boy approaching
his blue bag was slung over his shoulder honest industry beamed in his eye a determination to proceed to mr_trabb with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait
with a shock he became aware of me and was severely visited as before but this time his motion was rotatory and he staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted and with uplifted hand as if beseeching for mercy
this was a hard thing to bear but this was nothing he was coming round a narrow corner his sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators and i felt utterly confounded
i had not got as much further down the street as the post office when i again beheld mr_trabb boy shooting round by a back way
he wore the blue bag in the manner of my great coat and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street attended by a company of delighted young friend to whom he from time to time exclaimed with a wave of his hand dont know yah
word cannot state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by mr_trabb boy when passing abreast of me he pulled up his shirt collar twined his side hair stuck an arm akimbo and smirked extravagantly by wriggling his elbows and body and drawling to his attendants dont know yah dont know yah pon
the disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when i was a blacksmith culminated the disgrace with which i left the town and was so to speak ejected by it into the open country
but unless i had taken the life of mr_trabb boy on that occasion i really do not even now see what i could have done save endure
to have struggled with him in the street or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his heart best blood would have been futile and degrading
moreover he was a boy whom no man could hurt an invulnerable and dodging serpent who when chased into a corner flew out again between his captor leg scornfully yelping
i wrote however to mr_trabb by next day post to say that mr_pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to the best interests of society as to employ a boy who excited loathing in every respectable mind
the coach with mr_jaggers inside came up in due time and i took my box seat again and arrived in london safe but not sound for my heart was gone
as soon as i arrived i sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to mrs_joe_gargery as reparation for not having gone myself and then went on to barnard inn
this time he was entirely changed my soul dont know yah i found herbert_pocket dining on cold meat and delighted to welcome me back
having despatched the avenger to the coffee house for an addition to the dinner i felt that i must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum
as confidence was out of the question with the avenger in the hall which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole i sent him to the play
a better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded than the degrading shifts to which i was constantly driven to find him employment
dinner done and we sitting with our foot upon the fender i said to herbert_pocket my dear herbert_pocket i have something very particular to tell you
so mean is extremity that i sometimes sent him to hyde park corner to see what clock it was my dear handel he returned i shall esteem and respect your confidence
herbert_pocket crossed his foot looked at the fire with his head on one side and having looked at it in vain for some time looked at me because i didnt go on
it concerns myself herbert_pocket said i and one other person herbert_pocket said i laying my hand upon his knee i love i adore
miss_estella instead of being transfixed herbert_pocket replied in an easy matter of course way exactly well well herbert_pocket is that all you say
well what next i mean said herbert_pocket of course i know that how do you know it said i_
how do i know it handel why from you i never told you told me you have never told me when you have got your hair cut but i have had senses to perceive it
you have always adored her ever since i have known you you brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together told me
when you told me your own story you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her when you were very young indeed
very well then said i to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light i have never left off adoring her
why you have always told me all day long and she has come back a most beautiful and most elegant creature
and i saw her yesterday and if i adored her before i now doubly adore her lucky for you then handel said herbert_pocket that you are picked out for her and allotted to her
without encroaching on forbidden ground we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact
have you any idea yet of miss_estella views on the adoration question i shook my head gloomily oh she is thousands of miles away from me said i patience my dear handel time enough time enough
but you have something more to say i am ashamed to say it i returned and yet it no worse to say it than to think it
you call me a lucky fellow of course i am i was a blacksmith boy but yesterday i am what shall i say i am to day
say a good fellow if you want a phrase returned herbert_pocket smiling and clapping his hand on the back of mine a good fellow with impetuosity and hesitation boldness and diffidence action and dreaming curiously mixed in him
i stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character on the whole i by no means recognized the analysis but thought it not worth disputing
when i ask what i am to call myself to day herbert_pocket i went on i suggest what i have in my thought
i know i have done nothing to raise myself in life and that fortune alone has raised me that is being very lucky
you say i am lucky and yet when i think of miss_estella and when dont you you know herbert_pocket threw in with his eye on the fire which i thought kind and sympathetic of him
then my dear herbert_pocket i cannot tell you how dependent and uncertain i feel and how exposed to hundreds of chances
avoiding forbidden ground as you did just now i may still say that on the constancy of one person naming no person all my expectations depend
in saying this i relieved my mind of what had always been there more or less though no doubt most since yesterday
and at the best how indefinite and unsatisfactory only to know so vaguely what they are now handel herbert_pocket replied in his gay hopeful way
it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion we are looking into our gift horse mouth with a magnifying glass
likewise it seems to me that concentrating our attention on the examination we altogether overlook one of the best point of the animal
didnt you tell me that your guardian mr_jaggers told you in the beginning that you were not endowed with expectations only
you believe that of all man in london mr_jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground
and even if he had not told you so though that is a very large if i grant could i said i could not deny that this was a strong point
i said it people often do so in such case like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice as if i wanted to deny it
i should think it was a strong point said herbert_pocket and i should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger as to the rest you must bide your guardian time and he must bide his client time
you ll be one and twenty before you know where you are and then perhaps you ll get some further enlightenment at all events you ll be nearer getting it for it must come at last
what a hopeful disposition you have said i gratefully admiring his cheery way i ought to have said herbert_pocket for i have not much else
i must acknowledge by the by that the good sense of what i have just said is not my own but my father
the only remark i ever heard him make on your story was the final one the thing is settled and done or mr_jaggers would not be in it
and now before i say anything more about my father or my father son and repay confidence with confidence i want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment positively repulsive
you wont succeed said i yes i shall said he one two three and now i am in for it
fellow though he spoke in this light tone he was very much in earnest i have been thinking since we have been talking with our foot on this fender that miss_estella surely cannot be a condition of your inheritance if she was never referred to by your guardian
am i right in so understanding what you have told me as that he never referred to her directly or indirectly in any way
handel my good never even hinted for instance that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately never now handel i am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes upon my soul and honor
i turned my head aside for with a rush and a sweep like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea
a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when i left the forge when the mists were solemnly rising and when i laid my hand upon the village finger post smote upon my heart again
not being bound to her can you not detach yourself from her i told you i should be disagreeable there was silence between us for a little while
yes but my dear handel herbert_pocket went on as if we had been talking instead of silent its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstance made so romantic renders it very serious
think of her bringing up and think of miss_havisham think of what she is herself now i am repulsive and you abominate me
this may lead to miserable thing i know it herbert_pocket said i with my head still turned away but i cant help it
well said herbert_pocket getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep and stirring the fire now i ll endeavor to make myself agreeable again
so he went round the room and shook the curtains out put the chair in their place tidied the book and so forth that were lying about looked into the hall peeped into the letter box shut the door and came back to his chair by the fire where he sat down nursing his left leg in both arm
you cant detach yourself no impossible you cant try handel no impossible i was going to say a word or two handel concerning my father and my father son
i am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father son to remark that my father establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping
there is always plenty herbert_pocket said i to say something encouraging yes and so the dustman says i believe with the strongest approval and
so does the marine store shop in the back street gravely handel for the subject is grave enough you know how it is as well as i do
i suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up but if ever there was the time is gone
may i ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking down in your part of the country that the child of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married
this was such a singular question that i asked him in return is it so i dont know said herbert_pocket that what i want to know
because it is decidedly the case with us my poor sister charlotte who was next me and died before she was fourteen was a striking example
in her desire to be matrimonially established you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss
little miss_jane is the same little alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at kew
and indeed i think we are all engaged except the baby then you are said i i am said herbert_pocket
but it a secret i assured him of my keeping the secret and begged to be favored with further particulars
he had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that i wanted to know something about his strength may i ask the name
yes perhaps i ought to mention said herbert_pocket who had become curiously crestfallen and meek since we entered on the interesting theme that she is rather below my mother nonsensical family notions
i said name of clara said herbert_pocket live in london her father had to do with the victualling of passenger ships
i think he was a species of purser what is he now said i he an invalid now replied herbert_pocket
living on on the first floor said herbert_pocket which was not at all what i meant for i had intended my question to apply to his means
i have never seen him for he has always kept his room overhead since i have known clara but i have heard him constantly
he makes tremendous rows roars and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument in looking at me and then laughing heartily herbert_pocket for the time recovered his usual lively manner
yes i constantly expect to see him returned herbert_pocket because i never hear him without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling
when he had once more laughed heartily he became meek again and told me that the moment he began to realize capital it was his intention to marry this young lady
dont you expect to see him said i but i dont know how long the rafters may hold he added as a self evident proposition engendering low spirits but you cant marry you know while you re looking about you
as we contemplated the fire and as i thought what a difficult vision to realize this same capital sometimes was i put my hand in my pocket
a folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention i opened it and found it to be the play bill_barley i had received from mrs_joe_gargery relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of roscian renown
and bless my heart i involuntarily added aloud it to night this changed the subject in an instant and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play
so when i had pledged myself to comfort and abet herbert_pocket in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable means and when herbert_pocket had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that i should be presented to her and when we had warmly shaken hand upon our mutual confidence we blew out our candles made up our fire locked our door and issued forth in quest of mr_wopsle and denmark
on our arrival in denmark we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm chair on a kitchen table holding a court
the whole of the danish nobility were in attendance consisting of a noble boy in the wash leather boots of a gigantic ancestor a venerable peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life and the danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk leg and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance
my gifted townsman stood gloomily apart with folded arm and i could have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable
the late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease but to have taken it with him to the tomb and to have brought it back
the royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring and that too with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality
it was this i conceive which led to the shade being advised by the gallery to turn over a recommendation which it took extremely ill
it was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall
the queen of denmark a very buxom lady though no doubt historically brazen was considered by the public to have too much brass about her her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal as if she had a gorgeous toothache her waist being encircled by another and each of her arm by another so that she was openly mentioned as the kettle drum
the noble boy in the ancestral boots was inconsistent representing himself as it were in one breath as an able seaman a strolling actor a grave digger a clergyman and a person of the utmost importance at a court fencing match on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged
this gradually led to a want of toleration for him and even on his being detected in holy orders and declining to perform the funeral service to the general indignation taking the form of nuts
lastly ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness that when in course of time she had taken off her white muslin scarf folded it up and buried it a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery growled
chapter xxxi several curious little circumstance transpired as the action proceeded this occasioned its terrors to be received derisively now the baby put to bed let have supper
which to say the least of it was out of keeping upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect
as for example on the question whether twas nobler in the mind to suffer some roared yes and some no and some inclining to both opinions said toss up for it and quite a debating society arose
when he asked what should such fellow as he do crawling between earth and heaven he was encouraged with loud cries of hear hear
whenever that undecided prince had to ask a question or state a doubt the public helped him out with it
when he appeared with his stocking disordered its disorder expressed according to usage by one very neat fold in the top which i suppose to be always got up with a flat iron a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his leg and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him
on his taking the recorders very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door he was called upon unanimously for rule britannia
when he recommended the player not to saw the air thus the sulky man said and dont you do it neither you re a deal worse than him
but his greatest trials were in the churchyard which had the appearance of a primeval forest with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash house on one side and a turnpike gate on the other
mr_wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak being descried entering at the turnpike the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way look out
and i grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted mr_wopsle on every one of these occasion here the undertaker a coming to see how you re a getting on with your work
i believe it is well known in a constitutional country that mr_wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull after moralizing over it without dusting his finger on a white napkin taken from his breast but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment wai ter
the arrival of the body for interment in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open was the signal for a general joy which was much enhanced by the discovery among the bearers of an individual obnoxious to identification
the joy attended mr_wopsle through his struggle with laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchen table and had died by inches from the ankles upward
we had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud mr_wopsle but they were too hopeless to be persisted in
i laughed in spite of myself all the time the whole thing was so droll and yet i had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in mr_wopsle elocution not for old associations sake i am afraid but because it was very slow very dreary very uphill and downhill and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstance of life or death ever expressed himself about anything
when the tragedy was over and he had been called for and hooted i said to herbert_pocket let us go at once or perhaps we shall meet him
therefore we had sat feeling keenly for him but laughing nevertheless from ear to ear we made all the haste we could downstairs but we were not quick enough either
standing at the door was a jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow who caught my eye as we advanced and said when we came up with him mr_pip and friend
identity of mr_pip and friend confessed mr waldengarver said the man would be glad to have the honor
waldengarver i repeated when herbert_pocket murmured in my ear probably mr_wopsle oh said i yes shall we follow you a few steps please
when we were in a side alley he turned and asked how did you think he looked i dressed him
i dont know what he had looked like except a funeral with the addition of a large danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary fire office
but i said he had looked very nice when he come to the grave said our conductor he showed his cloak beautiful
but judging from the wing it looked to me that when he see the ghost in the queen apartment he might have made more of his stockings
i modestly assented and we all fell through a little dirty swing door into a sort of hot packing case immediately behind it
here mr_wopsle was divesting himself of his danish garments and here there was just room for us to look at him over one another shoulder by keeping the packing case door or lid wide open
gentleman said mr_wopsle i am proud to see you i hope mr_pip you will excuse my sending round
i had the happiness to know you in former time and the drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged on the noble and the affluent
meanwhile mr waldengarver in a frightful perspiration was trying to get himself out of his princely sables skin the stockings off mr waldengarver said the owner of that property or you ll bust em
bust em and you ll bust five and thirty shillings shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair keep quiet in your chair now and leave em to me
with that he went upon his knees and began to flay his victim who on the first stocking coming off would certainly have fallen over backward with his chair but for there being no room to fall anyhow
i had been afraid until then to say a word about the play but then mr waldengarver looked up at us complacently and said
gentleman how did it seem to you to go in front herbert_pocket said from behind at the same time poking me capitally
so i said capitally how did you like my reading of the character gentleman said mr waldengarver almost if not quite with patronage
herbert_pocket said from behind again poking me massive and concrete so i said boldly as if i had originated it and must beg to insist upon it massive and concrete
i am glad to have your approbation gentleman said mr waldengarver with an air of dignity in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time and holding on by the seat of the chair
but i ll tell you one thing mr waldengarver said the man who was on his knees in which you re out in your reading
now mind i dont care who says contrairy i tell you so you re out in your reading of hamlet when you get your leg in profile
the last hamlet as i dressed made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal till i got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins and then at that rehearsal which was the last
i went in front sir to the back of the pit and whenever his reading brought him into profile i called out i dont see no wafers
and at night his reading was lovely mr waldengarver smiled at me as much as to say a faithful dependent i overlook his folly and then said aloud
my view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here but they will improve they will improve herbert_pocket and i said together no doubt they would improve
did you observe gentleman said mr waldengarver that there was a man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service i
mean the representation we basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man i added he was drunk no doubt
dear no sir said mr_wopsle not drunk his employer would see to that sir his employer would not allow him to be drunk
you know his employer said i mr_wopsle shut his eye and opened them again performing both ceremonies very slowly
you must have observed gentleman said he an ignorant and a blatant ass with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity who went through i will not say sustained the rôle if i may use a french expression of claudius king of denmark
without distinctly knowing whether i should have been more sorry for mr_wopsle if he had been in despair i was so sorry for him as it was that i took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put on which
that is his employer gentleman such is the profession jostled us out at the doorway to ask herbert_pocket what he thought of having him home to supper
therefore i invited him and he went to barnard with us wrapped up to the eye and we did our best for him and he sat until two clock in the morning reviewing his success and developing his plans
i forget in detail what they were but i have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the drama and to end with crushing it inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope
miserably i went to bed after all and miserably thought of miss_estella and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled and that i had to give my hand in marriage to herbert_pocket clara or play hamlet to miss_havisham ghost before twenty thousand people without knowing twenty word of it
one day when i was busy with my book and mr_matthew_pocket i received a note by the post the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter for though i had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed i divined whose hand it was
it had no set beginning as dear mr_pip or dear mr_pip or dear sir or dear anything but ran thus
herbert_pocket said he thought it would be kind to do so chapter xxxii i am to come to london the day after to morrow by the midday coach
i believe it was settled you should meet me at all events miss_havisham has that impression and i write in obedience to it
if there had been time i should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion but as there was not i was fain to be content with those i had
she sends you her regard yours miss_estella my appetite vanished instantly and i knew no peace or rest until the day arrived
not that its arrival brought me either for then i was worse than ever and began haunting the coach office in wood street cheapside before the coach had left the blue_boar in our town
i still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time and in this condition of unreason i had performed the first half hour of a watch of four or five hour when mr_wemmick ran against me
for all that i knew this perfectly well halloa mr_pip said he how do you do i should hardly have thought this was your beat
i explained that i was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach and i inquired after the castle and the aged
i have a notion of firing eighty two time if the neighborhood shouldnt complain and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure
both flourishing thankye said mr_wemmick and particularly the aged he in wonderful feather he ll be eighty two next birthday however this is not london talk
where do you think i am going to to the office said i for he was tending in that direction
we are in a banker parcel case just at present and i have been down the road taking a squint at the scene of action and thereupon must have a word or two with our client
next thing to it returned mr_wemmick i am going to newgate did your client commit the robbery i asked
bless your soul and body no answered mr_wemmick very drily but he is accused of it so might you or i be
either of us might be accused of it you know only neither of us is i remarked yah said mr_wemmick touching me on the breast with his forefinger you re a deep one mr_pip
i had so much time to spare that the proposal came as a relief notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach office
muttering that i would make the inquiry whether i had time to walk with him i went into the office and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected which
would you like to have a look at newgate have you time to spare i knew beforehand quite as well as he
i then rejoined mr_wemmick and affecting to consult my watch and to be surprised by the information i had received accepted his offer
we were at newgate in a few minutes and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare wall among the prison rules into the interior of the jail
at that time jails were much neglected and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment was still far off
so felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers to say nothing of paupers and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup
it was visiting time when mr_wemmick took me in and a potman was going his rounds with beer and the prisoners behind bars in yards were buying beer and talking to friend and a frowzy ugly disorderly depressing scene it was
this was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night and saying what captain tom
it struck me that mr_wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his plants are you there
ah indeed and also is that black bill_barley behind the cistern why i didnt look for you these two months how do you find yourself
equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers always singly mr_wemmick with his post office in an immovable state looked at them while in conference as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made since last observed towards coming out in full blow at their trial
he was highly popular and i found that he took the familiar department of mr_jaggers business though something of the state of mr_jaggers hung about him too forbidding approach beyond certain limits
his personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hand and then tightening the post office and putting his hand in his pocket
in one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees and then mr_wemmick backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced said it no use my boy
if you are unable to make up your quantum my boy you had better address yourself to a principal there are plenty of principals in the profession you know and what is not worth the while of one may be worth the while of another
i only a subordinate i cant take it dont go on in that way with a subordinate that my recommendation to you speaking as a subordinate
thus we walked through mr_wemmick greenhouse until he turned to me and said notice the man i shall shake hand with
dont try on useless measures why should you now who next i should have done so without the preparation as he had shaken hand with no one yet
almost as soon as he had spoken a portly upright man whom i can see now as i write in a well worn olive colored frock coat with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion and eye that went wandering about when he tried to fix them came up to a corner of the bars and put his hand to his hat which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth with a half serious and half jocose military salute
colonel to you said mr_wemmick how are you colonel all right mr_wemmick everything was done that could be done but the evidence was too strong for us colonel
yes it was too strong sir but i dont care no no said mr_wemmick coolly you dont care then turning to me served his majesty this man
and the man eye looked at me and then looked over my head and then looked all round me and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed
was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge i said indeed i think i shall be out of this on monday sir he said to mr_wemmick
i am glad to have the chance of bidding you good bye mr_wemmick said the man stretching out his hand between two bars
perhaps returned my friend but there no knowing thankye said mr_wemmick shaking hand with him same to you colonel
if what i had upon me when taken had been real mr_wemmick said the man unwilling to let his hand go i should have asked the favor of your wearing another ring in acknowledgment of your attentions
i ll accept the will for the deed said mr_wemmick by the by you were quite a pigeon fancier
the man looked up at the sky i am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair if you ve no further use for em
it shall be done sir all right said mr_wemmick they shall be taken care of good afternoon colonel good bye
they shook hand again and as we walked away mr_wemmick said to me a coiner a very good workman the recorder report is made to day and he is sure to be executed on monday
with that he looked back and nodded at this dead plant and then cast his eye about him in walking out of the yard as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place
as we came out of the prison through the lodge i found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys no less than by those whom they held in charge
well mr_wemmick said the turnkey who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gate and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other what mr_jaggers going to do with that water side murder
still you see as far as it goes a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same is he going to make it manslaughter or what he going to make of it
why dont you ask him returned mr_wemmick yes i dare say said the turnkey now that the way with them here mr_pip remarked mr_wemmick turning to me with his post office elongated
they dont mind what they ask of me the subordinate but you ll never catch em asking any question of my principal
is this young gentleman one of the prentices or articled one of your office asked the turnkey with a grin at mr_wemmick humor
there he goes again you see cried mr_wemmick i told you so asks another question of the subordinate before his first is dry
well supposing mr_pip is one of them why then said the turnkey grinning again he knows what mr_jaggers is
cried mr_wemmick suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way you re dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal you know you are
yah let us out you old fox or i ll get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment
the turnkey laughed and gave us good day and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street
mind you mr_pip said mr_wemmick gravely in my ear as he took my arm to be more confidential i dont know that mr_jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high
he always so high his constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities that colonel durst no more take leave of him than that turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case
then between his height and them he slips in his subordinate dont you see and so he has em soul and body
to confess the truth i very heartily wished and not for the first time that i had had some other guardian of minor abilities
mr_wemmick and i parted at the office in little britain where suppliants for mr_jaggers notice were lingering about as usual and i returned to my watch in the street of the coach office with some three hour on hand
i consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that i should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime that in my childhood out on our lonely marsh on a winter evening i should have first encountered it that it should have reappeared on two occasion starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone that it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement
while my mind was thus engaged i thought of the beautiful young miss_estella proud and refined coming towards me and i thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her
i wished that mr_wemmick had not met me or that i had not yielded to him and gone with him so that of all day in the year on this day i might not have had newgate in my breath and on my clothes
i beat the prison dust off my foot as i sauntered to and fro and i shook it out of my dress and i exhaled its air from my lungs
so contaminated did i feel remembering who was coming that the coach came quickly after all and i was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of mr_wemmick conservatory when i saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me
i was very much impressed and not for the first time by my guardian subtlety what was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed
chapter xxxiii in her furred travelling dress miss_estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet even in my eye
her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before and i thought i saw miss_havisham influence in the change
we stood in the inn yard while she pointed out her luggage to me and when it was all collected i remembered having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile that i knew nothing of her destination
our lesson is that there are two richmonds one in surrey and one in yorkshire and that mine is the surrey richmond
i am going to richmond she told me the distance is ten miles i am to have a carriage and you are to take me
this is my purse and you are to pay my charges out of it you must take the purse we have no choice you and i but to obey our instructions
we are not free to follow our own devices you and i as she looked at me in giving me the purse i hoped there was an inner meaning in her word
she said them slightingly but not with displeasure a carriage will have to be sent for miss_estella will you rest here a little
yes i am to rest here a little and i am to drink some tea and you are to take care of me the while
she drew her arm through mine as if it must be done and i requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life to show us a private sitting room
upon that he pulled out a napkin as if it were a magic clew without which he couldnt find the way upstairs and led us to the black hole of the establishment fitted up with a diminishing mirror quite a superfluous article considering the hole proportions an anchovy sauce cruet and somebody pattens
on my objecting to this retreat he took us into another room with a dinner table for thirty and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy book under a bushel of coal dust
which proving to be merely some tea for the lady sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind
i was and i am sensible that the air of this chamber in its strong combination of stable with soup stock might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department
having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head he took my order yet the room was all in all to me miss_estella being in it
i thought that with her i could have been happy there for life i was not at all happy there at the time observe and i knew it well
i am going to live said she at a great expense with a lady there who has the power or says she has of taking me about and introducing me and showing people to me and showing me to people
where are you going to at richmond i asked miss_estella i suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration
yes i suppose so she answered so carelessly that i said you speak of yourself as if you were some one else
come come said miss_estella smiling delightfully you must not expect me to go to school to you i must talk in my own way
where did you learn how i speak of others how do you thrive with mr_matthew_pocket i live quite pleasantly there at least it appeared to me that i was losing a chance
at least repeated miss_estella as pleasantly as i could anywhere away from you you silly boy said miss_estella quite composedly how can you talk such nonsense
your friend mr_matthew_pocket i believe is superior to the rest of his family very superior indeed he is nobody enemy
dont add but his own interposed miss_estella for i hate that class of man but he really is disinterested and above small jealousy and spite i have heard
you have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people said miss_estella nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying for they beset miss_havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage
they watch you misrepresent you write letters about you anonymous sometimes and you are the torment and the occupation of their life
i am sure i have every reason to say so you can scarcely realize to yourself the hatred those people feel for you
they do me no harm i hope instead of answering miss_estella burst out laughing this was very singular to me and i looked at her in considerable perplexity
when she left off and she had not laughed languidly but with real enjoyment i said in my diffident way with her
i hope i may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm no no you may be sure of that said miss_estella
you may be certain that i laugh because they fail those people with miss_havisham and the tortures they undergo
she laughed again and even now when she had told me why her laughter was very singular to me for i could not doubt its being genuine and yet it seemed too much for the occasion
i thought there must really be something more here than i knew she saw the thought in my mind and answered it
it is not easy for even you said miss_estella to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous i have when they are made ridiculous
you had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you suppressed and defenceless under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing
you did not gradually open your round childish eye wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night
for you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby i was i had i did
it was no laughing matter with miss_estella now nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place i would not have been the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap
first notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone you may set your mind at rest that these people never will never would in hundred year impair your ground with miss_havisham in any particular great or small
second i am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain and there is my hand upon it
two thing i can tell you said miss_estella as she gave it to me playfully for her darker mood had been but momentary i held it and put it to my lips
you ridiculous boy said miss_estella will you never take warning or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which i once let you kiss my cheek
what spirit was that said i i must think a moment a spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters
if i say yes may i kiss the cheek again you should have asked before you touched the hand
now said miss_estella gliding away the instant i touched her cheek you are to take care that i have some tea and you are to take me to richmond
her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us and we were mere puppets gave me pain but everything in our intercourse did give me pain
whatever her tone with me happened to be i could put no trust in it and build no hope on it and yet i went on against trust and against hope
but yes if you like i leaned down and her calm face was like a statue why repeat it a thousand time
i rang for the tea and the waiter reappearing with his magic clew brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment but of tea not a glimpse
a teaboard cups and saucers plates knives and forks including carvers spoons various saltcellars a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley a pale loaf with a powdered head two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread and ultimately a fat family urn which the waiter staggered in with expressing in his countenance burden and suffering
after a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs
these i steeped in hot water and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of i dont know what for miss_estella
the bill_barley paid and the waiter remembered and the ostler not forgotten and the chambermaid taken into consideration in a word the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity and miss_estella purse much lightened we got into our post coach and drove away
so it always was turning into cheapside and rattling up newgate street we were soon under the wall of which i was so ashamed
what place is that miss_estella asked me i made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it and then told her
as she looked at it and drew in her head again murmuring wretches i would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration
mr_jaggers said i by way of putting it neatly on somebody else has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in london
he is more in the secrets of every place i think said miss_estella in a low voice you have been accustomed to see him often i suppose
i have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals ever since i can remember but i know him no better now than i did before i could speak plainly
what is your own experience of him do you advance with him once habituated to his distrustful manner said i i have done very well
are you intimate i have dined with him at his private house i fancy said miss_estella shrinking that must be a curious place
i should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her but i should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in gerrard street if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas
it seemed while it lasted to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling i had had before and when we were out of it i was as much dazed for a few moment as if i had been in lightning
so we fell into other talk and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling and about what part of london lay on this side of it and what on that
the great city was almost new to her she told me for she had never left miss_havisham neighborhood until she had gone to france and she had merely passed through london then in going and returning
it is a curious place i asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here
it was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me that she made herself winning and would have won me even if the task had needed pains
yet this made me none the happier for even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others i should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush it and throw it away
when we passed through hammersmith i showed her where mr_matthew_pocket lived and said it was no great way from richmond and that i hoped i should see her sometimes
o yes you are to see me you are to come when you think proper you are to be mentioned to the family indeed you are already mentioned
to that she emphatically said god forbid and no more i inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of
no there are only two mother and daughter the mother is a lady of some station though not averse to increasing her income
it is a part of miss_havisham plans for me mr_pip said miss_estella with a sigh as if she were tired i am to write to her constantly and see her regularly and report how i go on i and the jewels for
i wonder miss_havisham could part with you again so soon they are nearly all mine now it was the first time she had ever called me by my name
we came to richmond all too soon and our destination there was a house by the green a staid old house where hoops and powder and patches embroidered coats rolled stockings ruffles and swords had had their court day many a time
some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts but their own allotted place in the great procession of the dead were not far off and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest
a bell with an old voice which i dare say in its time had often said to the house here is the green farthingale here is the diamond hilted sword here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire sounded gravely in the moonlight and two cherry colored maids came fluttering out to receive miss_estella
the doorway soon absorbed her boxes and she gave me her hand and a smile and said good night and was absorbed likewise
and still i stood looking at the house thinking how happy i should be if i lived there with her and knowing that i never was happy with her but always miserable
i got into the carriage to be taken back to hammersmith and i got in with a bad heart ache and i got out with a worse heart ache
at our own door i found little miss_jane pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover and i envied her little lover in spite of his being subject to flopson
mr_matthew_pocket was out lecturing for he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy and his treatises on the management of child and servants were considered the very best text book on those themes
but mrs_pocket was at home and was in a little difficulty on account of the baby having been accommodated with a needle case to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence with a relative in the foot guards of millers
and more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender year either to apply externally or to take as a tonic
mr_matthew_pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice and for having a clear and sound perception of thing and a highly judicious mind i had some notion in my heart ache of begging him to accept my confidence
but happening to look up at mrs_pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing bed as a sovereign remedy for baby i thought
as i had grown accustomed to my expectations i had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me
their influence on my own character i disguised from my recognition as much as possible but i knew very well that it was not all good
of course she did so purposely and knew that i should treasure it up well no i wouldnt chapter xxxiv i lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to mrs_joe_gargery
when i woke up in the night like mrs_camilla i used to think with a weariness on my spirits that i should have been happier and better if i had never seen miss_havisham face and had risen to manhood content to be partners with mrs_joe_gargery in the honest old forge
many a time of an evening when i sat alone looking at the fire i thought after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home
yet miss_estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind that i really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production
that is to say supposing i had had no expectations and yet had had miss_estella to think of i could not make out to my satisfaction that i should have done much better
now concerning the influence of my position on others i was in no such difficulty and so i perceived though dimly enough perhaps that it was not beneficial to anybody and above all that it was not beneficial to herbert_pocket
my lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford corrupted the simplicity of his life and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets
i was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the pocket family to the poor arts they practised because such littlenesses were their natural bent and would have been evoked by anybody else if i had left them slumbering
but herbert_pocket was a very different case and it often caused me a twinge to think that i had done him evil service in crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work and placing the canary breasted avenger at his disposal
my conscience was not by any means comfortable about biddy so now as an infallible way of making little ease great ease i began to contract a quantity of debt
at startop suggestion we put ourselves down for election into a club called the finches of the grove the object of which institution i have never divined if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs
i know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished that herbert_pocket and i understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society which ran gentleman may the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the finches of the grove
the finches spent their money foolishly the hotel we dined at was in covent garden and the first finch i saw when i had the honor of joining the grove was mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corner
occasionally he shot himself out of his equipage headforemost over the apron and i saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the grove in this unintentional way like coals
but here i anticipate a little for i was not a finch and could not be according to the sacred laws of the society until i came of age
in my confidence in my own resources i would willingly have taken herbert_pocket expenses on myself but herbert_pocket was proud and i could make no such proposal to him
i could hardly begin but herbert_pocket must begin too so he soon followed so he got into difficulties in every direction and continued to look about him
when we gradually fell into keeping late hour and late company i noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfast time that he began to look about him more hopefully about mid day that he drooped when he came into dinner that he seemed to descry capital in the distance rather clearly after dinner that he all but realized capital towards midnight and that at about two clock in the morning he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to america with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune
i was usually at hammersmith about half the week and when i was at hammersmith i haunted richmond whereof separately by and by
herbert_pocket would often come to hammersmith when i was there and i think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for had not appeared yet
but in the general tumbling up of the family his tumbling out in life somewhere was a thing to transact itself somehow
while mrs_pocket tripped up the family with her footstool read her book of dignities lost her pocket handkerchief told us about her grandpapa and taught the young idea how to shoot by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice
as i am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me i can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manner and customs at barnard inn
we spent as much money as we could and got as little for it as people could make up their mind to give us
in the meantime mr_matthew_pocket grew grayer and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair we were always more or less miserable and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition
there was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves and a skeleton truth that we never did
to the best of my belief our case was in the last aspect a rather common one every morning with an air ever new herbert_pocket went into the city to look about him
i often paid him a visit in the dark back room in which he consorted with an ink jar a hat peg a coal box a string box an almanac a desk and stool and a ruler and i do not remember that i ever saw him do anything else but look about him
if we all did what we undertake to do as faithfully as herbert_pocket did we might live in a republic of the virtues
he had nothing else to do poor fellow except at a certain hour of every afternoon to go to lloyd in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal i think
when he felt his case unusually serious and that he positively must find an opening he would go on change at a busy time and walk in and out in a kind of gloomy country dance figure among the assembled magnates
for says herbert_pocket to me coming home to dinner on one of those special occasion i find the truth to be handel that an opening wont come to one but one must go to it so
he never did anything else in connection with lloyd that i could find out except come back again i have been
if we had been less attached to one another i think we must have hated one another regularly every morning
i detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance and could not endure the sight of the avenger livery which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the four and twenty hour
as we got more and more into debt breakfast became a hollower and hollower form and being on one occasion at breakfast time threatened by letter with legal proceedings not unwholly unconnected as my local paper might put it with jewelery i went so far as to seize the avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his foot so that he was actually in the air like a booted cupid for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll
at certain time meaning at uncertain time for they depended on our humor i would say to herbert_pocket as if it were a remarkable discovery
my dear handel herbert_pocket would say to me in all sincerity if you will believe me those very word were on my lips by a strange coincidence
my dear herbert_pocket we are getting on badly then herbert_pocket i would respond let us look into our affairs
i always thought this was business this was the way to confront the thing this was the way to take the foe by the throat
we ordered something rather special for dinner with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way in order that our mind might be fortified for the occasion and we might come well up to the mark
dinner over we produced a bundle of pens a copious supply of ink and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper
we always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose and i know herbert_pocket thought so too for there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery
i would then take a sheet of paper and write across the top of it in a neat hand the heading memorandum of mr_pip debts with barnard inn and the date very carefully added
each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side which had been thrown into drawers worn into holes in pocket half burnt in lighting candles stuck for weeks into the looking glass and otherwise damaged
the sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly insomuch that i sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money
herbert_pocket would also take a sheet of paper and write across it with similar formalities memorandum of herbert_pocket debts in point of meritorious character the two thing seemed about equal
when we had written a little while i would ask herbert_pocket how he got on herbert_pocket probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures
they are mounting up handel herbert_pocket would say upon my life they are mounting up be firm herbert_pocket i would retort plying my own pen with great assiduity
look the thing in the face look into your affairs stare them out of countenance so i would handel only they are staring me out of countenance
after a time he would give up once more on the plea that he had not got cobbs bill_barley or lobbs or nobbs as the case might be
however my determined manner would have its effect and herbert_pocket would fall to work again then herbert_pocket estimate estimate it in round numbers and put it down
what a fellow of resource you are my friend would reply with admiration really your business powers are very remarkable
i thought so too i established with myself on these occasion the reputation of a first rate man of business prompt decisive energetic clear cool headed
when i had got all my responsibilities down upon my list i compared each with the bill_barley and ticked it off
when i had no more ticks to make i folded all my bills up uniformly docketed each on the back and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle
then i did the same for herbert_pocket who modestly said he had not my administrative genius and felt that i had brought his affairs into a focus for him
my self approval when i ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation my business habits had one other bright feature which i called leaving a margin
for example supposing herbert_pocket debts to be one hundred and sixty four pounds four and twopence i would say leave a margin and put them down at two hundred
or supposing my own to be four time as much i would leave a margin and put them down at seven hundred
i had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same margin but i am bound to acknowledge that on looking back i deem it to have been an expensive device
for we always ran into new debt immediately to the full extent of the margin and sometimes in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted got pretty far on into another margin
but there was a calm a rest a virtuous hush consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me for the time an admirable opinion of myself
soothed by my exertions my method and herbert_pocket compliments i would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationary and feel like a bank of some sort rather than a private individual
i had fallen into my serene state one evening when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door and fall on the ground
it for you handel said herbert_pocket going out and coming back with it and i hope there is nothing the matter
we shut our outer door on these solemn occasion in order that we might not be interrupted
the letter was signed mr_trabb co and its contents were simply that i was an honored sir and that they begged to inform me that mrs mrs_joe_gargery had departed this life on monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening and that my attendance was requested at the interment on monday next at three clock in the afternoon
it was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful
this was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border chapter xxxv the figure of my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire haunted me night and day
that the place could possibly be without her was something my mind seemed unable to compass and whereas she had seldom or never been in my thought of late i had now the strangest idea that she was coming towards me in the street or that she would presently knock at the door
in my room too with which she had never been at all associated there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure as if she were still alive and had been often there
whatever my fortunes might have been i could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness but i suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness
under its influence and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling i was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered so much and i felt that on sufficient proof i could have revengefully pursued old_orlick or any one else to the last extremity
having written to mrs_joe_gargery to offer him consolation and to assure him that i would come to the funeral i passed the intermediate day in the curious state of mind i have glanced at
i went down early in the morning and alighted at the blue_boar in good time to walk over to the forge
it was fine summer weather again and as i walked along the time when i was a little helpless creature and my sister did not spare me vividly returned
for now the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me
at last i came within sight of the house and saw that mr_trabb and co had put in a funereal execution and taken possession
two dismally absurd person each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody were posted at the front door and in one of them i recognized a postboy discharged from the boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arm
all the child of the village and most of the woman were admiring these sable warders and the closed window of the house and forge and as i came up one of the two warders the postboy knocked at the door implying that i was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself
another sable warder a carpenter who had once eaten two geese for a wager opened the door and showed me into the best parlor
here mr_trabb had taken unto himself the best table and had got all the leaves up and was holding a kind of black bazaar with the aid of a quantity of black pins
at the moment of my arrival he had just finished putting somebody hat into black long clothes like an african baby so he held out his hand for mine
but i misled by the action and confused by the occasion shook hand with him with every testimony of warm affection
poor dear mrs_joe_gargery entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin was seated apart at the upper end of the room where as chief mourner he had evidently been stationed by mr_trabb
but they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of tickler when i bent down and said to him dear mrs_joe_gargery how are you
he said mr_pip old chap you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a and clasped my hand and said no more
when i had spoken to biddy as i thought it not a time for talking i went and sat down near mrs_joe_gargery and there began to wonder in what part of the house it
biddy looking very neat and modest in her black dress went quietly here and there and was very helpful she my sister was
i looked about for the table of refreshments it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom but there was a cut up plum cake upon it and there were cut up oranges and sandwiches and biscuits and two decanters that i knew very well as ornaments but had never seen used in all my life one full of port and one of sherry
standing at this table i became conscious of the servile mr_pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband who was alternately stuffing himself and making obsequious movements to catch my attention
the moment he succeeded he came over to me breathing sherry and crumbs and said in a subdued voice may i dear sir and did
the air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet cake i then descried mr and mrs_hubble the last named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner
we were all going to follow and were all in course of being tied up separately by mr_trabb into ridiculous bundles
which i meantersay mr_pip mrs_joe_gargery whispered me as we were being what mr_trabb called formed in the parlor two and two and
it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance which i meantersay sir as i would in preference have carried her to the church myself along with three or four friendly one wot come to it with willing harts and arm but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect
pocket handkerchiefs out all cried mr_trabb at this point in a depressed business like voice pocket handkerchiefs out we are ready
so we all put our pocket handkerchiefs to our face as if our noses were bleeding and filed out two and two
the remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door and it being a point of undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human leg shuffling and blundering along under the guidance of two keepers the postboy and his comrade
the neighborhood however highly approved of these arrangements and we were much admired as we went through the village the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off and lying in wait to intercept us at point of vantage
at such time the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy here they come
mrs_joe_gargery and i biddy and mr_pumblechook mr and mrs_hubble here they are and we were all but cheered
in this progress i was much annoyed by the abject mr_pumblechook who being behind me persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband and smoothing my cloak
my thought were further distracted by the excessive pride of mr and mrs_hubble who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession
and now the range of marsh lay clear before us with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it and we went into the churchyard close to the graves of my unknown parents philip pirrip late of this parish and also miss_georgiana wife of the above
and there my sister was laid quietly in the earth while the larks sang high above it and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees
of the conduct of the worldly minded mr_pumblechook while this was doing i desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out and
how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay i heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property
when we got back he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known i had done her so much honor and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death
after that he drank all the rest of the sherry and mr hubble drank the port and the two talked which i have since observed to be customary in such case as if they were of quite another race from the deceased and were notoriously immortal
i felt sure and to tell the jolly_bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor
when they were all gone and when mr_trabb and his man but not his boy i looked for him had crammed their mummery into bags and were gone too the house felt wholesomer
soon afterwards biddy mrs_joe_gargery and i had a cold dinner together but we dined in the best parlor not in the old kitchen and mrs_joe_gargery was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not that there was great restraint upon us
but after dinner when i made him take his pipe and when i had loitered with him about the forge and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it we got on better
i noticed that after the funeral mrs_joe_gargery changed his clothes so far as to make a compromise between his sunday dress and working dress in which the dear fellow looked natural and like the man he was
he was very much pleased by my asking if i might sleep in my own little room and i was pleased too
finally he went away with mr and mrs_hubble to make an evening of it for i felt that i had done rather a great thing in making the request
when the shadows of evening were closing in i took an opportunity of getting into the garden with biddy for a little talk
biddy said i i think you might have written to me about these sad matters do you mr_pip said biddy
dont suppose that i mean to be unkind biddy when i say i consider that you ought to have thought that
she was so quiet and had such an orderly good and pretty way with her that i did not like the thought of making her cry again
i should have written if i had thought that do you mr_pip after looking a little at her downcast eye as she walked beside me i gave up that point
i suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now biddy dear oh i cant do so mr_pip said biddy in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction
i have been speaking to mrs_hubble and i am going to her to morrow i hope we shall be able to take some care of mr mrs_joe_gargery together until he settles down
how are you going to live biddy if you want any mo how am i going to live repeated biddy striking in with a momentary flush upon her face
i ll tell you mr_pip i am going to try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here
i can be well recommended by all the neighbors and i hope i can be industrious and patient and teach myself while i teach others
you know mr_pip pursued biddy with a smile as she raised her eye to my face the new schools are not like the old but i learnt a good deal from you after that time and have had time since then to improve
i think you would always improve biddy under any circumstance ah except in my bad side of human nature murmured biddy
it was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud well i thought i would give up that point too
so i walked a little further with biddy looking silently at her downcast eye i have not heard the particulars of my sister death biddy
she had been in one of her bad state though they had got better of late rather than worse for four day when she came out of it in the evening just at tea time and said quite plainly mrs_joe_gargery
as she had never said any word for a long while i ran and fetched in mr mrs_joe_gargery from the forge
she made signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her and wanted me to put her arm round his neck
they are very slight poor thing so i put them round his neck and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied
and so she never lifted her head up any more and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed because we found she was gone
biddy cried the darkening garden and the lane and the stars that were coming out were blurred in my own sight
and so she presently said mrs_joe_gargery again and once pardon and once mr_pip nothing was ever discovered biddy nothing
do you know what is become of old_orlick i should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries
of course you have seen him then why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane i saw him there on the night she died
no i have seen him there since we have been walking here it is of no use said biddy laying her hand upon my arm as i was for running out you know i would not deceive you
that was not the last time either biddy he was not there a minute and he is gone
it revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow and i felt inveterate against him
i told her so and told her that i would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country
by degrees she led me into more temperate talk and she told me how mrs_joe_gargery loved me and how mrs_joe_gargery never complained of anything she
didnt say of me she had no need i knew what she meant but ever did his duty in his way of life with a strong hand a quiet tongue and a gentle heart
indeed it would be hard to say too much for him said i and biddy we must often speak of these thing for of course i shall be often down here now
i am not going to leave poor mrs_joe_gargery alone biddy said never a single word biddy dont you hear me
yes mr_pip not to mention your calling me mr_pip which appears to me to be in bad taste
biddy what do you mean what do i mean asked biddy timidly biddy said i in a virtuously self asserting manner i must request to know what you mean by this
by this said biddy now dont echo i retorted you used not to echo biddy used not said biddy
mr_pip used well i rather thought i would give up that point too after another silent turn in the garden i fell back on the main position
biddy said i i made a remark respecting my coming down here often to see mrs_joe_gargery which you received with a marked silence
are you quite sure then that you will come to see him often asked biddy stopping in the narrow garden walk and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye
have the goodness biddy to tell me why dear me said i as if i found myself compelled to give up biddy in despair
this really is a very bad side of human nature dont say any more if you please biddy this shocks me very much
for which cogent reason i kept biddy at a distance during supper and when i went up to my own old little room took as stately a leave of her as i could in my murmuring soul deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day
as often as i was restless in the night and that was every quarter of an hour i reflected what an unkindness what an injury what an injustice biddy had done me
early in the morning i was to go early in the morning i was out and looking in unseen at one of the wooden window of the forge
there i stood for minutes looking at mrs_joe_gargery already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it
good bye dear mrs_joe_gargery no dont wipe it off for god sake give me your blackened hand i shall be down soon and often
never too soon sir said mrs_joe_gargery and never too often mr_pip biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread
biddy said i when i gave her my hand at parting i am not angry but i am hurt
no dont be hurt she pleaded quite pathetically let only me be hurt if i have been ungenerous once more the mists were rising as i walked away
if they disclosed to me as i suspect they did that i should not come back and that biddy was quite right all i can say is they were quite right too
chapter xxxvi herbert_pocket and i went on from bad to worse in the way of increasing our debts looking into our affairs leaving margins and the like exemplary transactions and time went on whether or no as he has a way of doing and i came of age in fulfilment of herbert_pocket prediction that i should do so before i knew where i was
as he had nothing else than his majority to come into the event did not make a profound sensation in barnard inn
but we had looked forward to my one and twentieth birthday with a crowd of speculations and anticipations for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion
herbert_pocket himself had come of age eight months before me i had taken care to have it well understood in little britain when my birthday was
on the day before it i received an official note from mr_wemmick informing me that mr_jaggers would be glad if i would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day
this convinced us that something great was to happen and threw me into an unusual flutter when i repaired to my guardian office a model of punctuality
in the outer office mr_wemmick offered me his congratulations and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissue paper that i liked the look of
it was november and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney piece with his hand under his coattails
but he said nothing respecting it and motioned me with a nod into my guardian room well mr_pip said he i must call you mr_pip to day
congratulations mr_pip we shook hand he was always a remarkably short shaker and i thanked him take a chair mr_pip said my guardian
as i sat down and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his boots i felt at a disadvantage which reminded me of that old time when i had been put upon a tombstone
the two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation
now my young friend my guardian began as if i were a witness in the box i am going to have a word or two with you
what do you suppose said mr_jaggers bending forward to look at the ground and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling what
if you please sir do you suppose you are living at the rate of at the rate of sir
at repeated mr_jaggers still looking at the ceiling the rate of and then looked all round the room and paused with his pocket handkerchief in his hand half way to his nose
i had looked into my affairs so often that i had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion i might ever have had of their bearings
this reply seemed agreeable to mr_jaggers who said i thought so and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction
reluctantly i confessed myself quite unable to answer the question now i have asked you a question my friend said mr_jaggers
of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several question sir but i remember your prohibition
have you anything to ask me ask one said mr_jaggers is my benefactor to be made known to me to day
no ask another is that confidence to be imparted to me soon waive that a moment said mr_jaggers and ask another
i looked about me but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry have i anything to receive sir
on that mr_jaggers said triumphantly i thought we should come to it and called to mr_wemmick to give him that piece of paper
you have been drawing pretty freely here your name occurs pretty often in mr_wemmick cash book but you are in debt of course
mr_wemmick appeared handed it in and disappeared now mr_pip said mr_jaggers attend if you please i am afraid i must say yes sir
i dont ask you what you owe because you dont know and if you did know you wouldnt tell me you would say less
you know you must say yes dont you said mr_jaggers yes sir yes yes my friend cried mr_jaggers waving his forefinger to stop me as i made a show of protesting
it likely enough that you think you wouldnt but you would you ll excuse me but i know better than you now take this piece of paper in your hand
you have got it very good now unfold it and tell me what it is this is a bank note said i for five hundred pounds
that is a bank note repeated mr_jaggers for five hundred pounds and a very handsome sum of money too i think
you consider it so how could i do otherwise ah but answer the question said mr_jaggers undoubtedly you consider it undoubtedly a handsome sum of money
now that handsome sum of money mr_pip is your own it is a present to you on this day in earnest of your expectations
and at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum and at no higher rate you are to live until the donor of the whole appears
that is to say you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hand and you will draw from mr_wemmick one hundred and twenty five pounds per quarter until you are in communication with the fountain head and no longer with the mere agent
as i have told you before i am the mere agent i execute my instructions and i am paid for doing so
i was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which i was treated when mr_jaggers stopped me
i am not paid mr_pip said he coolly to carry your word to any one and then gathered up his coat tails as he had gathered up the subject and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against him
i think them injudicious but i am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits after a pause i hinted
there was a question just now mr_jaggers which you desired me to waive for a moment i hope i am doing nothing wrong in asking it again
i might have known that he would never help me out but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh as if it were quite new
is it likely i said after hesitating that my patron the fountain head you have spoken of mr_jaggers will soon there i delicately stopped
what is it said he will soon what asked mr_jaggers that no question as it stands you know
will soon come to london said i after casting about for a precise form of word or summon me anywhere else
now here replied mr_jaggers fixing me for the first time with his dark deep set eye we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village
what did i tell you then mr_pip you told me mr_jaggers that it might be year hence when that person appeared
as we looked full at one another i felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him
and as i felt that it came quicker and as i felt that he saw that it came quicker i felt that i had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him
just so said mr_jaggers that my answer do you suppose it will still be year hence mr_jaggers
mr_jaggers shook his head not in negativing the question but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer it and the two horrible casts of the twitched face looked when my eye strayed up to them as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention and were going to sneeze
come said mr_jaggers warming the back of his leg with the back of his warmed hand i ll be plain with you my friend mr_pip
that a question i must not be asked you ll understand that better when i tell you it a question that might compromise me
he bent down so low to frown at his boots that he was able to rub the calves of his leg in the pause he made
come i ll go a little further with you i ll say something more when that person discloses said mr_jaggers straightening himself you and that person will settle your own affairs
when that person discloses my part in this business will cease and determine when that person discloses it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it
and that all i have got to say we looked at one another until i withdrew my eye and looked thoughtfully at the floor
from this last speech i derived the notion that miss_havisham for some reason or no reason had not taken him into her confidence as to her designing me for miss_estella that he resented this and felt a jealousy about it or that he really did object to that scheme and would have nothing to do with it
when i raised my eye again i found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time and was doing so still
if that is all you have to say sir i remarked there can be nothing left for me to say
he nodded assent and pulled out his thief dreaded watch and asked me where i was going to dine i replied at my own chambers with herbert_pocket
as a necessary sequence i asked him if he would favor us with his company and he promptly accepted the invitation
but he insisted on walking home with me in order that i might make no extra preparation for him and first he had a letter or two to write and of course had his hand to wash
the fact was that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket a thought had come into my head which had been often there before and it appeared to me that mr_wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought
so i said i would go into the outer office and talk to mr_wemmick he had already locked up his safe and made preparations for going home
he had left his desk brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door ready to be extinguished he had raked his fire low put his hat and great coat ready and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe key as an athletic exercise after business
mr_wemmick tightened his post office and shook his head as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort
mr_wemmick said i i want to ask your opinion i am very desirous to serve a friend
this friend i pursued is trying to get on in commercial life but has no money and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning
now i want somehow to help him to a beginning with money down said mr_wemmick in a tone drier than any sawdust
with some money down i replied for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home with some money down and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations
mr_pip said mr_wemmick i should like just to run over with you on my finger if you please the name of the various bridges up as high as chelsea reach
he had checked off each bridge in its turn with the handle of his safe key on the palm of his hand
let see there london one southwark two blackfriars three waterloo four westminster five vauxhall six there as many as six you see to choose from
i dont understand you said i choose your bridge mr_pip returned mr_wemmick and take a walk upon your bridge and pitch your money into the thames over the centre arch of your bridge and you know the end of it
serve a friend with it and you may know the end of it too but it a less pleasant and profitable end
i could have posted a newspaper in his mouth he made it so wide after saying this this is very discouraging said i meant to be so said mr_wemmick
then is it your opinion i inquired with some little indignation that a man should never invest portable property in a friend said mr_wemmick
certainly he should not unless he wants to get rid of the friend and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him
and that said i is your deliberate opinion mr_wemmick that he returned is my deliberate opinion in this office
ah said i pressing him for i thought i saw him near a loophole here but would that be your opinion at walworth
mr_pip he replied with gravity walworth is one place and this office is another much as the aged is one person and mr_jaggers is another
they must not be confounded together my walworth sentiments must be taken at walworth none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office
very well said i much relieved then i shall look you up at walworth you may depend upon it mr_pip he returned you will be welcome there in a private and personal capacity
we had held this conversation in a low voice well knowing my guardian ears to be the sharpest of the sharp
as he now appeared in his doorway towelling his hand mr_wemmick got on his great coat and stood by to snuff out the candles
we all three went into the street together and from the door step mr_wemmick turned his way and mr_jaggers and i turned ours
i could not help wishing more than once that evening that mr_jaggers had had an aged in gerrard street or a stinger or a something or a somebody to unbend his brows a little
it was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty first birthday that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it
he was a thousand time better informed and cleverer than mr_wemmick and yet i would a thousand time rather have had mr_wemmick to dinner
and mr_jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy because after he was gone herbert_pocket said of himself with his eye fixed on the fire that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it he felt so dejected and guilty
chapter xxxvii deeming sunday the best day for taking mr_wemmick walworth sentiments i devoted the next ensuing sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the castle
on arriving before the battlements i found the union jack flying and the drawbridge up but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance i rang at the gate and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the aged
my son sir said the old man after securing the drawbridge rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoon walk
i nodded at the old gentleman as mr_wemmick himself might have nodded and we went in and sat down by the fireside
he is very regular in his walks is my son very regular in everything is my son
you made acquaintance with my son sir said the old man in his chirping way while he warmed his hand at the blaze at his office i expect
i nodded hah i have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his business sir i nodded hard
which makes it more surprising in my son said the old man for he was not brought up to the law but to the wine coopering
curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of mr_jaggers i roared that name at him
he threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner no to be sure you re right
and to this hour i have not the faintest notion what he meant or what joke he thought i had made
as i could not sit there nodding at him perpetually without making some other attempt to interest him i shouted at inquiry whether his own calling in life had been the wine coopering
by dint of straining that term out of myself several time and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him i at last succeeded in making my meaning understood
yes so they tell me his business is the law i nodded harder no said the old gentleman the warehousing the warehousing
first over yonder he appeared to mean up the chimney but i believe he intended to refer me to liverpool and then in the city of london here
yes hard of hearing having that infirmity coming upon me my son he went into the law and he took charge of me and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property
but returning to what you said you know pursued the old man again laughing heartily what i say is no to be sure you re right
i was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this imaginary pleasantry when i was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with john upon it
however having an infirmity for i am hard of hearing sir i expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment the old man following my eye cried with great triumph
it was worth any money to see mr_wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat when we might have shaken hand across it with the greatest ease
the aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge that i made no offer to assist him but stood quiet until mr_wemmick had come across and had presented me to miss_skiffins a lady by whom he was accompanied
my son come home and we both went out to the drawbridge miss_skiffins was of a wooden appearance and was like her escort in the post office branch of the service
she might have been some two or three year younger than mr_wemmick and i judged her to stand possessed of portable property
the cut of her dress from the waist upward both before and behind made her figure very like a boy kite and i might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange and her gloves a little too intensely green
i was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the castle for on our going in and my complimenting mr_wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the aged he begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney and disappeared
presently another click came and another little door tumbled open with miss_skiffins on it then miss_skiffins shut up and john tumbled open then miss_skiffins and john both tumbled open together and finally shut up together
on mr_wemmick return from working these mechanical appliances i expressed the great admiration with which i regarded them and he said well you know they re both pleasant and useful to the aged
and by george sir it a thing worth mentioning that of all the people who come to this gate the secret of those pulls is only known to the aged miss_skiffins and me
but she seemed to be a good sort of fellow and showed a high regard for the aged and mr_wemmick made them added miss_skiffins with his own hand out of his own head
while miss_skiffins was taking off her bonnet she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company mr_wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property and see how the island looked in wintertime
thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his walworth sentiments i seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the castle
having thought of the matter with care i approached my subject as if i had never hinted at it before
i informed mr_wemmick that i was anxious in behalf of herbert_pocket and i told him how we had first met and how we had fought
i glanced at herbert_pocket home and at his character and at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for those uncertain and unpunctual
i alluded to the advantages i had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society and i confessed that i feared i had but ill repaid them and that he might have done better without me and my expectations
keeping miss_havisham in the background at a great distance i still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul and being far above any mean distrusts retaliations or designs
for all these reason i told mr_wemmick and because he was my young companion and friend and i had a great affection for him i wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him and therefore i sought advice from mr_wemmick experience and knowledge of man and affairs how i could best try with my resources to help herbert_pocket to some present income say of a hundred a year to keep him in good hope and heart and gradually to buy him on to some small partnership
i begged mr_wemmick in conclusion to understand that my help must always be rendered without herbert_pocket knowledge or suspicion and that there was no one else in the world with whom i could advise
i wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder and saying i cant help confiding in you though i know it must be troublesome to you but that is your fault in having ever brought me here
mr_wemmick was silent for a little while and then said with a kind of start well you know mr_pip i must tell you one thing
this is devilish good of you say you ll help me to be good then said i ecod replied mr_wemmick shaking his head that not my trade
nor is this your trading place said i you are right he returned you hit the nail on the head
mr_pip i ll put on my considering cap and i think all you want to do may be done by degrees skiffins that her brother is an accountant and agent
on the contrary said he i thank you for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity still it may be mentioned that there are newgate cobwebs about and it brushes them away
after a little further conversation to the same effect we returned into the castle where we found miss_skiffins preparing tea
the responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the aged and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eye
i ll look him up and go to work for you i thank you ten thousand time it was no nominal meal that we were going to make but a vigorous reality
the aged prepared such a hay stack of buttered toast that i could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top bar while miss_skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited and repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment
the flag had been struck and the gun had been fired at the right moment of time and i felt as snugly cut off from the rest of walworth as if the moat were thirty foot wide by as many deep
nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the castle but the occasional tumbling open of john and miss_skiffins which little door were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until i got used to it
i inferred from the methodical nature of miss_skiffins arrangements that she made tea there every sunday night and i rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon was a piece of portable property that had been given her by mr_wemmick
we ate the whole of the toast and drank tea in proportion and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it
after a short pause of repose miss_skiffins in the absence of the little servant who it seemed retired to the bosom of her family on sunday afternoons washed up the tea thing in a trifling lady like amateur manner that compromised none of us
then she put on her gloves again and we drew round the fire and mr_wemmick said now aged parent tip us the paper
mr_wemmick explained to me while the aged got his spectacles out that this was according to custom and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud
the aged especially might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe just oiled i wont offer an apology said mr_wemmick for he isnt capable of many pleasures are you aged
all right john all right returned the old man seeing himself spoken to only tip him a nod every now
and then when he look off his paper said mr_wemmick and he ll be as happy as a king we are all attention
aged one all right john all right returned the cheerful old man so busy and so pleased that it really was quite charming
the aged reading reminded me of the classes at mr_wopsle great aunt with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole
as he wanted the candles close to him and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them he required as much watching as a powder mill
but mr_wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance and the aged read on quite unconscious of his many rescues
as mr_wemmick and miss_skiffins sat side by side and as i sat in a shadowy corner i observed a slow and gradual elongation of mr_wemmick mouth powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round miss_skiffins waist
in course of time i saw his hand appear on the other side of miss_skiffins but at that moment miss_skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her
whenever he looked at us we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement and nodded until he resumed again miss_skiffins composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights i have ever seen and
if i could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind i should have deemed that miss_skiffins performed it mechanically
by and by i noticed mr_wemmick arm beginning to disappear again and gradually fading out of view shortly afterwards his mouth began to widen again
after an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful i saw his hand appear on the other side of miss_skiffins
instantly miss_skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer took off that girdle or cestus as before and laid it on the table
taking the table to represent the path of virtue i am justified in stating that during the whole time of the aged reading mr_wemmick arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by miss_skiffins
this was the time for mr_wemmick to produce a little kettle a tray of glasses and a black bottle with a porcelain topped cork representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect
with the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink including the aged who was soon awake again
at last the aged read himself into a light slumber miss_skiffins mixed and i observed that she and mr_wemmick drank out of one glass
of course i knew better than to offer to see miss_skiffins home and under the circumstance i thought i had best go first which i did taking a cordial leave of the aged and having passed a pleasant evening
before a week was out i received a note from mr_wemmick dated walworth stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities and that he would be glad if i could come and see him again upon it
so i went out to walworth again and yet again and yet again and i saw him by appointment in the city several time but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near little britain
the upshot was that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping broker not long established in business who wanted intelligent help and who wanted capital and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner
between him and me secret articles were signed of which herbert_pocket was the subject and i paid him half of my five hundred pounds down and engaged for sundry other payments some to fall due at certain dates out of my income some contingent on my coming into my property
miss_skiffins brother conducted the negotiation mr_wemmick pervaded it throughout but never appeared in it the whole business was so cleverly managed that herbert_pocket had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it
i never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon and told me as a mighty piece of news of his having fallen in with one clarriker the young merchant name and of clarriker having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him and of his belief that the opening had come at last
day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter he must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend for i had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when i saw him so happy
at length the thing being done and he having that day entered clarriker house and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success i did really cry in good earnest when i went to bed to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody
but before i proceed to narrate it and before i pass on to all the changes it involved i must give one chapter to miss_estella
a great event in my life the turning point of my life now opens on my view it is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart
if that staid old house near the green at richmond should ever come to be haunted when i am dead it will be haunted surely by my ghost
o the many many night and day through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when miss_estella lived there
the lady with whom miss_estella was placed mrs brandley by name was a widow with one daughter several year older than miss_estella
the mother looked young and the daughter looked old the mother complexion was pink and the daughter was yellow the mother set up for frivolity and the daughter for theology
chapter xxxviii let my body be where it would my spirit was always wandering wandering wandering about that house they were in what is called a good position and visited and were visited by numbers of people
little if any community of feeling subsisted between them and miss_estella but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her and that she was necessary to them
in mrs brandley house and out of mrs brandley house i suffered every kind and degree of torture that miss_estella could cause me
the nature of my relations with her which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favor conduced to my distraction
she made use of me to tease other admirers and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her
mrs brandley had been a friend of miss_havisham before the time of her seclusion if i had been her secretary steward half brother poor
i had been a younger brother of her appointed husband i could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when i was nearest to her
the privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by mine became under the circumstance an aggravation of my trials and while i think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers i know too certainly that it almost maddened me
no doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her but there were more than enough of them without that
i saw her often at richmond i heard of her often in town and i used often to take her and the brandleys on the water there were picnics fête day plays operas concerts parties all sorts of pleasures through which i pursued her and they were all miseries to me
i never had one hour happiness in her society and yet my mind all round the four and twenty hour was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death
throughout this part of our intercourse and it lasted as will presently be seen for what i then thought a long time she habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us
there were other time when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones and would seem to pity me
mr_pip pip she said one evening coming to such a check when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in richmond will you never take warning
relation if she had admirers without end of what of me warning not to be attracted by you do you mean miss_estella
i should have replied that love was commonly reputed blind but for the reason that i always was restrained and this was not the least of my miseries by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her when she knew that she could not choose but obey miss_havisham
my dread always was that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom
at any rate said i i have no warning given me just now for you wrote to me to come to you this time
do i mean if you dont know what i mean you are blind that true said miss_estella with a cold careless smile that always chilled me
after looking at the twilight without for a little while she went on to say the time has come round when miss_havisham wishes to have me for a day at satis
she would rather i did not travel alone and objects to receiving my maid for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people
you are to take me there and bring me back if you will can you take me can i take you miss_estella
you can then the day after to morrow if you please you are to pay all charges out of my purse you hear the condition of your going
and must obey said i this was all the preparation i received for that visit or for others like it miss_havisham never wrote to me nor had i ever so much as seen her handwriting
we went down on the next day but one and we found her in the room where i had first beheld her and it is needless to add that there was no change in satis house
she was even more dreadfully fond of miss_estella than she had been when i last saw them together i repeat the word advisedly for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her look and embraces
she hung upon miss_estella beauty hung upon her word hung upon her gestures and sat mumbling her own trembling finger while she looked at her as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared
from miss_estella she looked at me with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds
how does she use you mr_pip how does she use you she asked me again with her witch like eagerness even in miss_estella hearing
but when we sat by her flickering fire at night she was most weird for then keeping miss_estella hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand she extorted from her by dint of referring back to what miss_estella had told her in her regular letters the name and conditions of the man whom she had fascinated and as miss_havisham dwelt upon this roll with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased she sat with her other hand on her crutch stick and her chin on that and her wan bright eye glaring at me a very spectre
i saw in this wretched though it made me and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakened i saw in this that miss_estella was set to wreak miss_havisham revenge on man and that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term
sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief miss_havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose
i saw in this that i too was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity even while the prize was reserved for me
i saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme
i saw in this a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me in a word i saw in this miss_havisham as i had her then
and there before my eye and always had had her before my eye and i saw in this the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun
they were high from the ground and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed
as i looked round at them and at the pale gloom they made and at the stopped clock and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall i saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to repeated and thrown back to me
my thought passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread and i saw it written as it were in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre piece in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened heart behind the panels and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor
the candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall it happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp word arose between miss_estella and miss_havisham
we were seated by the fire as just now described and miss_havisham still had miss_estella arm drawn through her own and still clutched miss_estella hand in hers when miss_estella gradually began to detach herself
she had shown a proud impatience more than once before and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it
it was the first time i had ever seen them opposed what said miss_havisham flashing her eye upon her are you tired of me
only a little tired of myself replied miss_estella disengaging her arm and moving to the great chimney piece where she stood looking down at the fire
speak the truth you ingrate cried miss_havisham passionately striking her stick upon the floor you are tired of me
miss_estella looked at her with perfect composure and again looked down at the fire her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a self possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other
said miss_estella preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney piece and only moving her eye do you reproach me for being cold
that was almost cruel you stock and stone exclaimed miss_havisham you cold cold heart what you
are you not was the fierce retort you should know said miss_estella i am what you have made me
take all the praise take all the blame take all the success take all the failure in short take me look at her look at her cried miss_havisham bitterly
where i took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs and where i have lavished year of tenderness upon her
at least i was no party to the compact said miss_estella for if i could walk and speak when it was made it was as much as i could do
look at her so hard and thankless on the hearth where she was reared but what would you have you have been very good to me and i owe everything to you
what would you have love replied the other you have it i have not said miss_havisham
mother by adoption retorted miss_estella never departing from the easy grace of her attitude never raising her voice as the other did never yielding either to anger or tenderness mother by adoption i have said that i owe everything to you
all i possess is freely yours all that you have given me is at your command to have again beyond that i have nothing
and if you ask me to give you what you never gave me my gratitude and duty cannot do impossibilities
did i never give her a burning love inseparable from jealousy at all time and from sharp pain while she speaks thus to me
did i never give her love cried miss_havisham turning wildly to me let her call me mad let her call me mad
why should i call you mad returned miss_estella i of all people does any one live who knows what set purposes you have half as well as i do
i who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there learning your lessons and looking up into your face when your face was strange and frightened me
does any one live who knows what a steady memory you have half as well as i do soon forgotten moaned miss_havisham
time soon forgotten no not forgotten retorted miss_estella not forgotten but treasured up in my memory when have you found me false to your teaching
when have you found me unmindful of your lessons when have you found me giving admission here she touched her bosom with her hand to anything that you excluded
be just to me so proud so proud moaned miss_havisham pushing away her gray hair with both her hand
who taught me to be proud returned miss_estella who praised me when i learnt my lesson so hard so hard
moaned miss_havisham with her former action who taught me to be hard returned miss_estella who praised me when i learnt my lesson
but to be proud and hard to me miss_havisham quite shrieked as she stretched out her arm
miss_estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder but was not otherwise disturbed when the moment was past she looked down at the fire again
i cannot think said miss_estella raising her eye after a silence why you should be so unreasonable when i come to see you after a separation
miss_estella miss_estella miss_estella to be proud and hard to me i have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes i have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling
i have never shown any weakness that i can charge myself with would it be weakness to return my love exclaimed miss_havisham
i begin to think said miss_estella in a musing way after another moment of calm wonder that i almost understand how this comes about
if you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these room and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your face if
you had done that and then for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it you would have been disappointed and angry
miss_havisham with her head in her hand sat making a low moaning and swaying herself on her chair but gave no answer
or said miss_estella which is a nearer case if you had taught her from the dawn of her intelligence with your utmost energy and might that there was such a thing as daylight but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer and she must always turn against it for it had blighted you and would else blight her if you had done this and then for a purpose had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it you would have been disappointed and angry
but yes yes she would call it so miss_havisham sat listening or it seemed so for i could not see her face but still made no answer
so said miss_estella i must be taken as i have been made the success is not mine the failure is not mine but the two together make me
miss_havisham had settled down i hardly knew how upon the floor among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn
i took advantage of the moment i had sought one from the first to leave the room after beseeching miss_estella attention to her with a movement of my hand
miss_havisham gray hair was all adrift upon the ground among the other bridal wrecks and was a miserable sight to see
it was with a depressed heart that i walked in the starlight for an hour and more about the courtyard and about the brewery and about the ruined garden
when i left miss_estella was yet standing by the great chimney piece just as she had stood throughout when i at last took courage to return to the room
i found miss_estella sitting at miss_havisham knee taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces and of which i have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that i have seen hanging up in cathedrals
afterwards miss_estella and i played at cards as of yore only we were skilful now and played french games and so the evening wore away and i went to bed
it was the first time i had ever lain down to rest in satis house and sleep refused to come near me
she was on this side of my pillow on that at the head of the bed at the foot behind the half opened door of the dressing room in the dressing room in the room overhead in the room beneath everywhere
at last when the night was slow to creep on towards two clock i felt that i absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in and that i must get up
i therefore got up and put on my clothes and went out across the yard into the long stone passage designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind
but i was no sooner in the passage than i extinguished my candle for i saw miss_havisham going along it in a ghostly manner making a low cry
i lay in that separate building across the courtyard a thousand miss havishams haunted me i followed her at a distance and saw her go up the staircase
she carried a bare candle in her hand which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room and was a most unearthly object by its light
standing at the bottom of the staircase i felt the mildewed air of the feast chamber without seeing her open the door and i heard her walking there and so across into her own room and so across again into that never ceasing the low cry
after a time i tried in the dark both to get out and to go back but i could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hand
during the whole interval whenever i went to the bottom of the staircase i heard her footstep saw her light pass above and heard her ceaseless low cry
before we left next day there was no revival of the difference between her and miss_estella nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion and there were four similar occasion to the best of my remembrance
nor did miss_havisham manner towards miss_estella in anywise change except that i believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics
it is impossible to turn this leaf of my life without putting mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle name upon it or i would very gladly
on a certain occasion when the finches were assembled in force and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody agreeing with anybody else the presiding finch called the grove to order forasmuch as mr_drummle had not yet toasted a lady which according to the solemn constitution of the society it was the brute turn to do that day
i thought i saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round but as there was no love lost between us that might easily be
what was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to miss_estella miss_estella who said i_
never you mind retorted mr_drummle miss_estella of where said i you are bound to say of where which he was as a finch
of richmond gentleman said mr_drummle putting me out of the question and a peerless beauty much he knew about peerless beauties a mean miserable idiot
i whispered herbert_pocket i know that lady said herbert_pocket across the table when the toast had been honored do you said mr_drummle
this was the only retort except glass or crockery that the heavy creature was capable of making but i became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit and i immediately rose in my place and said that i could not but regard it as being like the honorable finch impudence to come down to that grove we always talked about coming down to that grove as a neat parliamentary turn of expression down to that grove proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing
and so do i i added with a scarlet face do you said mr_drummle lord mr_drummle upon this starting up demanded what i meant by that
whether it was possible in a christian country to get on without blood after this was a question on which the finches were divided
the debate upon it grew so lively indeed that at least six more honorable members told six more during the discussion that they believed they knew where they were to be found
however it was decided at last the grove being a court of honor that if mr_drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady importing that he had the honor of her acquaintance mr_pip must express his regret as a gentleman and a finch for having been betrayed into a warmth which
next day was appointed for the production lest our honor should take cold from delay and next day mr_drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in miss_estella hand that she had had the honor of dancing with him several time
this left me no course but to regret that i had been betrayed into a warmth which and on the whole to repudiate as untenable the idea that i was to be found anywhere
mr_drummle and i then sat snorting at one another for an hour while the grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate
whereupon i made him the extreme reply that i believed he knew where i was to be found i tell this lightly but it was no light thing to me
for i cannot adequately express what pain it gave me to think that miss_estella should show any favor to a contemptible clumsy sulky booby so very far below the average
to the present moment i believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her that i could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound
no doubt i should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress
it was easy for me to find out and i did soon find out that mr_drummle had begun to follow her closely and that she allowed him to do it
he held on in a dull persistent way and miss_estella held him on now with encouragement now with discouragement now almost flattering him now openly despising him now knowing him very well now scarcely remembering who he was
the spider as mr_jaggers had called him was used to lying in wait however and had the patience of his tribe
added to that he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness which sometimes did him good service almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose
so the spider doggedly watching miss_estella outwatched many brighter insects and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time
at a certain assembly ball at richmond there used to be assembly balls at most place then where miss_estella had outshone all other beauties this blundering mr_drummle so hung about her and with so much toleration on her part that i resolved to speak to her concerning him
i took the next opportunity which was when she was waiting for mrs blandley to take her home and was sitting apart among some flowers ready to go
a little while and he was always in pursuit of her and he and i crossed one another every day i was with her for i almost always accompanied them to and from such place
say rather i should not be for i have my letter to satis house to write before i go to sleep
are you tired miss_estella rather mr_pip you should be recounting to night triumph said i surely a very poor one miss_estella
what do you mean i didnt know there had been any miss_estella said i do look at that fellow in the corner yonder who is looking over here at us
why should i look at him returned miss_estella with her eye on me instead what is there in that fellow in the corner yonder to use your word that i need look at
indeed that is the very question i want to ask you said i for he has been hovering about you all night
moths and all sorts of ugly creatures replied miss_estella with a glance towards him hover about a lighted candle can the candle help it
no i returned but cannot the miss_estella help it well said she laughing after a moment perhaps yes anything you like
but miss_estella do hear me speak it makes me wretched that you should encourage a man so generally despised as mr_drummle
you know he is despised well said she you know he is as ungainly within as without a deficient ill tempered lowering stupid fellow
well said she you know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous roll of addle headed predecessors now dont you
to overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable i took it from her and said repeating it with emphasis well
well said she again and each time she said it she opened her lovely eye the wider then that is why it makes me wretched
now if i could have believed that she favored mr_drummle with any idea of making me me wretched i should have been in better heart about it but in that habitual way of hers she put me so entirely out of the question that i could believe nothing of the kind
mr_pip said miss_estella casting her glance over the room dont be foolish about its effect on you it may have its effect on others and may be meant to have
yes it is said i because i cannot bear that people should say she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor the lowest in the crowd
it not worth discussing i can bear it said miss_estella oh dont be so proud miss_estella and so inflexible
calls me proud and inflexible in this breath said miss_estella opening her hand and in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor
there is no doubt you do said i something hurriedly for i have seen you give him look and smiles this very night such as you never give to me
do you want me then said miss_estella turning suddenly with a fixed and serious if not angry look to deceive and entrap you
do you deceive and entrap him miss_estella yes and many others all of them but you here is mrs brandley
and now that i have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart and so often made it ache and ache again i pass on unhindered to the event that had impended over me longer yet the event that had begun to be prepared for before i knew that the world held miss_estella and in the day when her baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from miss_havisham wasting hand
in the eastern story the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring
all being made ready with much labor and the hour come the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his hand and he struck with it and the rope parted and rushed away and the ceiling fell
so in my case all the work near and afar that tended to the end had been accomplished and in an instant the blow was struck and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me
not another word had i heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations and my twenty third birthday was a week gone
i ll say no more chapter xxxix i was three and twenty year of age we had left barnard inn more than a year and lived in the temple
mr_matthew_pocket and i had for some time parted company as to our original relations though we continued on the best terms
i hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which i held my means i had a taste for reading and read regularly so many hour a day
that matter of herbert_pocket was still progressing and everything with me was as i have brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter
our chambers were in garden court down by the river notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything which business had taken herbert_pocket on a journey to marseilles
dispirited and anxious long hoping that to morrow or next week would clear my way and long disappointed i sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend
i was alone and had a dull sense of being alone it was wretched weather stormy and wet stormy and wet and mud mud mud deep in all the streets
day after day a vast heavy veil had been driving over london from the east and it drove still as if in the east there were an eternity of cloud and wind
so furious had been the gusts that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs and in the country trees had been torn up and sails of windmills carried away and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast of shipwreck and death
violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind and the day just closed as i sat down to read had been the worst of all
alterations have been made in that part of the temple since that time and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then nor is it so exposed to the river
we lived at the top of the last house and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night like discharges of cannon or breakings of a sea
when the rain came with it and dashed against the window i thought raising my eye to them as they rocked that i might have fancied myself in a storm beaten lighthouse
occasionally the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night and when i set the door open and looked down the staircase the staircase lamps were blown out and when i shaded my face with my hand and looked through the black window opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain
i saw that the lamps in the court were blown out and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering and that the coal fire in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red hot splashes in the rain
as i shut it saint paul and all the many church clocks in the city some leading some accompanying some following struck that hour
the sound was curiously flawed by the wind and i was listening and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it when i heard a footstep on the stair
i read with my watch upon the table purposing to close my book at eleven clock what nervous folly made me start and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead sister matters not
it was past in a moment and i listened again and heard the footstep stumble in coming on remembering then that the staircase light were blown out i took up my reading lamp and went out to the stair head
whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp for all was quiet there is some one down there is there not
i called out looking down yes said a voice from the darkness beneath what floor do you want
the top mr_pip that is my name there is nothing the matter nothing the matter returned the voice
and the man came on i stood with my lamp held out over the stair rail and he came slowly within its light
it was a shaded lamp to shine upon a book and its circle of light was very contracted so that he was in it for a mere instant and then out of it
in the instant i had seen a face that was strange to me looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me
moving the lamp as the man moved i made out that he was substantially dressed but roughly like a voyager by sea
that he was a muscular man strong on his leg and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather
as he ascended the last stair or two and the light of my lamp included us both i saw with a stupid kind of amazement that he was holding out both his hand to me
that he had long iron gray hair that his age was about sixty pray what is your business i asked him
my business he repeated pausing ah yes i will explain my business by your leave do you wish to come in
i had asked him the question inhospitably enough for i resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face
yes he replied i wish to come in master i resented it because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it
but i took him into the room i had just left and having set the lamp on the table asked him as civilly as i could to explain himself
he looked about him with the strangest air an air of wondering pleasure as if he had some part in the thing
then i saw that his head was furrowed and bald and that the long iron gray hair grew only on its side
he admired and he pulled off a rough outer coat and his hat but i saw nothing that in the least explained him
on the contrary i saw him next moment once more holding out both his hand to me what do you mean
said i half suspecting him to be mad he stopped in his looking at me and slowly rubbed his right hand over his head
it disapinting to a man he said in a coarse broken voice arter having looked for ard so distant and come so fur but you re not to blame for that neither on us is to blame for that
he sat down on a chair that stood before the fire and covered his forehead with his large brown veinous hand
i ll speak in half a minute give me half a minute please i looked at him attentively then and recoiled a little from him but i did not know him
there no one nigh said he looking over his shoulder is there why do you a stranger coming into my room at this time of the night ask that question said i_
you re a game one he returned shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection at once most unintelligible and most exasperating i glad you ve grow up a game one
but dont catch hold of me you be sorry arterwards to have done it i relinquished the intention he had detected for i knew him
if the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening year had scattered all the intervening objects had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels i could not have known my convict more distinctly than i knew him now as he sat in the chair before the fire
no need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head no need to hug himself with both his arm and take a shivering turn across the room looking back at me for recognition
even yet i could not recall a single feature but i knew him i knew him before he gave me one of those aids though a moment before
i had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity he came back to where i stood and again held out both his hand
not knowing what to do for in my astonishment i had lost my self possession i reluctantly gave him my hand he grasped them heartily raised them to his lips kissed them and still held them
at a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me i laid a hand upon his breast and put him away
you acted noble my boy said he noble mr_pip and i have never forgot it stay said i keep off
if you are grateful to me for what i did when i was a little child i hope you have shown your gratitude by mending your way of life
still however you have found me out there must be something good in the feeling that has brought you here and i will not repulse you but surely you must understand that i_
my attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at me that the word died away on my tongue
if you have come here to thank me it was not necessary you was a saying he observed when we had confronted one another in silence that surely i must understand
what surely must i understand that i cannot wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago under these different circumstance
i am glad to believe you have repented and recovered yourself i am glad to tell you so i am glad that thinking i deserve to be thanked you have come to thank me
but our way are different way none the less you are wet and you look weary will you drink something before you go
he had replaced his neckerchief loosely and had stood keenly observant of me biting a long end of it
i think he answered still with the end at his mouth and still observant of me that i will drink i thank you
afore i go there was a tray ready on a side table i brought it to the table near the fire and asked him what he would have
he touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking and i made him some hot rum and water
i tried to keep my hand steady while i did so but his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his neckerchief between his teeth evidently forgotten made my hand very difficult to master
when at last i put the glass to him i saw with amazement that his eye were full of tears up to this time i had remained standing not to disguise that i wished him gone
i hope said i hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself and drawing a chair to the table that you will not think i spoke harshly to you just now
but i was softened by the softened aspect of the man and felt a touch of reproach i had no intention of doing it and i am sorry for it if i did
as i put my glass to my lips he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief dropping from his mouth when he opened it and stretched out his hand
i wish you well and happy i gave him mine and then he drank and drew his sleeve across his eye and forehead
i ve been a sheep farmer stock breeder other trades besides away in the new world said he many a thousand mile of stormy water off from this
how are you living i asked him i hope you have done well i ve done wonderfully well
there others went out alonger me as has done well too but no man has done nigh as well as me
i famous for it i am glad to hear it i hope to hear you say so my dear boy
without stopping to try to understand those word or the tone in which they were spoken i turned off to a point that had just come into my mind
have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me i inquired since he undertook that trust never set eye upon him
i warnt likely to it he came faithfully and he brought me the two one pound notes i was a poor boy then as you know and to a poor boy they were a little fortune
but like you i have done well since and you must let me pay them back you can put them to some other poor boy use
he watched me as i laid my purse upon the table and opened it and he watched me as i separated two one pound notes from its contents
i took out my purse they were clean and new and i spread them out and handed them over to him
still watching me he laid them one upon the other folded them long wise gave them a twist set fire to them at the lamp and dropped the ashes into the tray
may i make so bold he said then with a smile that was like a frown and with a frown that was like a smile as ask you how you have done well since you and me was out on them lone shivering marsh
he emptied his glass got up and stood at the side of the fire with his heavy brown hand on the mantel shelf
he put a foot up to the bars to dry and warm it and the wet boot began to steam but he neither looked at it nor at the fire but steadily looked at me
when my lips had parted and had shaped some word that were without sound i forced myself to tell him though i could not do it distinctly that i had been chosen to succeed to some property
how ah it was only now that i began to tremble might a mere warmint ask what property said he
i faltered i dont know might a mere warmint ask whose property said he i faltered again i dont know
could i make a guess i wonder said the convict at your income since you come of age as to the first figure now
with my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action i rose out of my chair and stood with my hand upon the back of it looking wildly at him
five concerning a guardian he went on there ought to have been some guardian or such like whiles you was a minor
all the truth of my position came flashing on me and its disappointments dangers disgraces consequences of all kind rushed in in such a multitude that i was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath i drew
put it he resumed as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun with a and might be mr_jaggers put it as he had come over sea to portsmouth and had landed there and had wanted to come on to you
some lawyer maybe as to the first letter of that lawyer name now would it be however you have found me out you says just now
well however did i find you out why i wrote from portsmouth to a person in london for particulars of your address
that person name why mr_wemmick i could not have spoken one word though it had been to save my life
i stood with a hand on the chair back and a hand on my breast where i seemed to be suffocating i stood so looking wildly at him until i grasped at the chair when the room began to surge and turn
he caught me drew me to the sofa put me up against the cushions and bent on one knee before me bringing the face that i now well remembered and that i shuddered at very near to mine
yes mr_pip dear boy i ve made a gentleman on you it me wot has done it i swore that time sure as ever i earned a guinea that guinea should go to you
i swore arterwards sure as ever i spec lated and got rich you should get rich i lived rough that you should live smooth i worked hard that you should be above work
what odds dear boy do i tell it fur you to feel a obligation not a bit i tell it fur you to know as that there hunted dunghill dog
the abhorrence in which i held the man the dread i had of him the repugnance with which i shrank from him could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast
wot you kep life in got his head so high that he could make a gentleman and mr_pip you re him
look ee here mr_pip i your second father you re my son more to me nor any son i ve put away money only for you to spend
when i was a hired out shepherd in a solitary hut not seeing no face but face of sheep till i half forgot wot
i drops my knife many a time in that hut when i was a eating my dinner or my supper and i says here the boy again a looking at me whiles i eats and drinks
man and woman face wos like i see yourn i see you there a many time as plain as ever i see you on them misty marsh
lord strike me dead i says each time and i goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens but
wot if i gets liberty and money i ll make that boy a gentleman and i done it why look at you dear boy
look at these here lodgings yourn fit for a lord a lord ah you shall show money with lords for wagers and beat em
in his heat and triumph and in his knowledge that i had been nearly fainting he did not remark on my reception of all this
look ee here he went on taking my watch out of my pocket and turning towards him a ring on my finger while i recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake a gold un and a beauty that a gentleman i hope
it was the one grain of relief i had a diamond all set round with rubies that a gentleman i hope
look at your linen fine and beautiful look at your clothes better aint to be got and your book too turning his eye round the room mounting up on their shelves by hundreds
and you read em dont you i see you been a reading of em when i come in ha ha ha
you shall read em to me dear boy and if they re in foreign languages wot i dont understand i shall be just as proud as if i did
again he took both my hand and put them to his lips while my blood ran cold within me
dont you mind talking mr_pip said he after again drawing his sleeve over his eye and forehead as the click came in his throat which i well
he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest you cant do better nor keep quiet dear boy
remembered and you aint looked slowly forward to this as i have you wosnt prepared for this as i wos but didnt you never think it might be me
no no no i returned never never well you see it wos me and single handed never a soul in it but my own self and mr_jaggers
was there no one else i asked no said he with a glance of surprise who else should there be
and dear boy how good looking you have growed there bright eye somewheres eh isnt there bright eye somewheres wot you love the thought on
not that a gentleman like you so well set up as you cant win em off of his own game but money shall back you
miss_estella miss_estella they shall be yourn dear boy if money can buy em let me finish wot i was a telling you dear boy
from that there hut and that there hiring out i got money left me by my master which died and had been the same as me and got my liberty and went for myself
in every single thing i went for i went for you lord strike a blight upon it i says wotever it was i went for if it aint for him
it all prospered wonderful as i giv you to understand just now i famous for it it was the money left me and the gains of the first few year wot
i sent home to mr_jaggers all for you when he first come arter you agreeable to my letter that he had never come
that he had left me at the forge far from contented yet by comparison happy and then dear boy it was a recompense to me
the blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as i was walking what do i say
look ee here to know in secret that i was making a gentleman i says to myself i making a better gentleman nor ever you ll be
when one of em says to another he was a convict a few year ago and is a ignorant common fellow now for all he lucky what do i say
i says to myself if i aint a gentleman nor yet aint got no learning i the owner of such all on you owns stock and land which on you owns a brought up london gentleman
and this way i held steady afore my mind that i would for certain come one day and see my boy and make myself known to him on his own ground
this way i kep myself a going he laid his hand on my shoulder i shuddered at the thought that for anything i knew his hand might be stained with blood
but i held to it and the harder it was the stronger i held for i was determined and my mind firm made up
it warnt easy mr_pip for me to leave them part nor yet it warnt safe at last i done it
throughout i had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him even now i could not separate his voice from those voice though those were loud and his was silent
dear boy i done it i tried to collect my thought but i was stunned where will you put me
he asked presently i must be put somewheres dear boy to sleep said i yes and to sleep long and sound he answered for i ve been sea tossed and sea washed months and months
my friend and companion said i rising from the sofa is absent you must have his room he wont come back to morrow will he
because look ee here dear boy he said dropping his voice and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner caution is necessary
no said i answering almost mechanically in spite of my utmost efforts not to morrow how do you mean
caution by it death what death i was sent for life it death to come back there been overmuch coming back of late year and i should of a certainty be hanged if took
nothing was needed but this the wretched man after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for year had risked his life to come to me and i held it there in my keeping
if i had loved him instead of abhorring him if i had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance it could have been no worse
on the contrary it would have been better for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart
my first care was to close the shutters so that no light might be seen from without and then to close and make fast the door
while i did so he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit and when i saw him thus engaged i saw my convict on the marsh at his meal again
when i had gone into herbert_pocket room and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held i asked him if he would go to bed
it almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently to file at his leg he said yes but asked me for some of my gentleman linen to put on in the morning
i brought it out and laid it ready for him and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hand to give me good night
i got away from him without knowing how i did it and mended the fire in the room where we had been together and sat down by it afraid to go to bed
for an hour or more i remained too stunned to think and it was not until i began to think that i began fully to know how wrecked i was and how the ship in which i had sailed was gone to pieces
miss_havisham intentions towards me all a mere dream miss_estella not designed for me i only suffered in satis house as a convenience a sting for the greedy relations a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand those were the first smarts i had
knew not what crimes and liable to be taken out of those room where i sat thinking and hanged at the old bailey door that i had deserted mrs_joe_gargery
i would not have gone back to mrs_joe_gargery now i would not have gone back to biddy now for any consideration simply i suppose because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration
no wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that i should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity but i could never never undo what i had done
but sharpest and deepest pain of all it was for the convict guilty of i in every rage of wind and rush of rain i heard pursuers
with these fears upon me i began either to imagine or recall that i had had mysterious warnings of this man approach
twice i could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door that for weeks gone by i had passed face in the streets which i had thought like his
that his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word and with me
crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that i had seen him with my childish eye to be a desperately violent man that i had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him that i had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast
out of such remembrances i brought into the light of the fire a half formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night
this dilated until it filled the room and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden
that these likenesses had grown more numerous as he coming over the sea had drawn nearer he had rolled a handkerchief round his head and his face was set and lowering in his sleep
assured of this i softly removed the key to the outside of his door and turned it on him before i again sat down by the fire
but he was asleep and quietly too though he had a pistol lying on the pillow gradually i slipped from the chair and lay on the floor
when i awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness the clocks of the eastward churches were striking five the candles were wasted out the fire was dead and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness
it was fortunate for me that i had to take precautions to ensure so far as i could the safety of my dreaded visitor for this thought pressing on me when i awoke held other thought in a confused concourse at a distance
this is the end of the second stage of mr_pip expectations chapter xl the impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self evident
true i had no avenger in my service now but i was looked after by an inflammatory old female assisted by an animated rag bag whom she called her niece and to keep a room secret from them
it could not be done and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration
they both had weak eye which i had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes and they were always at hand when not wanted indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny
not to get up a mystery with these people i resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country
this course i decided on while i was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light
not stumbling on the means after all i was fain to go out to the adjacent lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern
now in groping my way down the black staircase i fell over something and that something was a man crouching in a corner
as the man made no answer when i asked him what he did there but eluded my touch in silence i ran to the lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly telling him of the incident on the way back
the wind being as fierce as ever we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there
it then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my room so lighting my candle at the watchman and leaving him standing at the door i examined them carefully including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep
it troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs on that night of all night in the year and i asked the watchman on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as i handed him a dram at the door whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out
all was quiet and assuredly no other man was in those chambers yes he said at different time of the night three
one lived in fountain court and the other two lived in the lane and he had seen them all go home
again the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks and he certainly had not returned in the night because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came upstairs
the night being so bad sir said the watchman as he gave me back my glass uncommon few have come in at my gate
besides them three gentleman that i have named i dont call to mind another since about eleven clock when a stranger asked for you
my uncle i muttered yes you saw him sir yes oh yes likewise the person with him
the person stopped when he stopped to make inquiry of me and the person took this way when he took this way
person with him i repeated i judged the person to be with him returned the watchman what sort of person
the watchman had not particularly noticed he should say a working person to the best of his belief he had a dust colored kind of clothes on under a dark coat
the watchman made more light of the matter than i did and naturally not having my reason for attaching weight to it
when i had got rid of him which i thought it well to do without prolonging explanations my mind was much troubled by these two circumstance taken together
whereas they were easy of innocent solution apart as for instance some diner out or diner at home who had not gone near this watchman gate might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep
there and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him to show him the way still joined they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hour had made me
i lighted my fire which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning and fell into a doze before it
as there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight i dozed again now waking up uneasily with prolix conversations about nothing in my ears now making thunder of the wind in the chimney at length falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start
i seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six all this time i had never been able to consider my own situation nor could i do so yet
i had not the power to attend to it i was greatly dejected and distressed but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way
when i opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning all of a leaden hue when i walked from room to room when i sat down again shivering before the fire waiting for my laundress to appear i thought how miserable i was but hardly knew why or how long i had been so or on what day of the week i made the reflection or even who i was that made it
at last the old woman and the niece came in the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire
to whom i imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly
then i washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust and so in a sort of dream or sleep waking i found myself sitting by the fire again waiting for
as to forming any plan for the future i could as soon have formed an elephant him to come to breakfast by and by his door opened and he came out
i could not bring myself to bear the sight of him and i thought he had a worse look by daylight
i do not even know said i speaking low as he took his seat at the table by what name to call you
i have given out that you are my uncle that it dear boy call me uncle you assumed some name i suppose on board ship
yes dear boy i took the name of mr_provis do you mean to keep that name why yes dear boy it as good as another unless
you like another what is your real name i asked him in a whisper abel_magwitch he answered in the same tone chrisen abel_magwitch
what were you brought up to be a warmint dear boy he answered quite seriously and used the word as if it denoted some profession
when you came into the temple last night said i pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night which seemed so long ago
yes dear boy when you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here had you any one with you
with me no dear boy but there was some one there i didnt take particular notice he said dubiously not knowing the way of the place
but i think there was a person too come in alonger me are you known in london i hope not said he giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that made me turn hot and sick
were you known in london once not over and above dear boy i was in the provinces mostly were you tried in london
which time said he with a sharp look the last time he nodded first knowed mr_jaggers that way
it was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for but he took up a knife gave it a flourish and with the word
mr_jaggers was for me and what i done is worked out and paid for fell to at his breakfast
some of his teeth had failed him since i saw him eat on the marsh and as he turned his food in his mouth and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon it he looked terribly like a hungry old dog
if i had begun with any appetite he would have taken it away and i should have sat much as i did repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion and gloomily looking at the cloth
i a heavy grubber dear boy he said as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal but i always was
he ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable and all his actions were uncouth noisy and greedy if it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber i might ha got into lighter trouble
similarly i must have my smoke when i was first hired out as shepherdt other side the world it my belief
as he said so he got up from table and putting his hand into the breast of the pea coat he wore brought out a short black pipe and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called negro head
i should ha turned into a molloncolly mad sheep myself if i hadnt a had my smoke having filled his pipe he put the surplus tobacco back again as if his pocket were a drawer
then he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs and lighted his pipe at it and then turned round on the hearth rug with his back to the fire and went through his favorite action of holding out both his hand for mine
and this said he dandling my hand up and down in his as he puffed at his pipe and this is the gentleman what i made
the real genuine one it does me good fur to look at you mr_pip all i stip late is to stand by and look at you dear boy
i released my hand as soon as i could and found that i was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition
what i was chained to and how heavily became intelligible to me as i heard his hoarse voice and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron gray hair at the side
i mustnt see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets there mustnt be no mud on his boots
my gentleman must have horses mr_pip horses to ride and horses to drive and horses for his servant to ride and drive as well
shall colonists have their horses and blood uns if you please good lord and not my london gentleman no no we ll show em another pair of shoes than that mr_pip wont us
he took out of his pocket a great thick pocket book bursting with papers and tossed it on the table
there something worth spending in that there book dear boy it yourn all i ve got aint mine it yourn dont you be afeerd on it
there more where that come from i ve come to the old country fur to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman
he wound up looking round the room and snapping his finger once with a loud snap blast you every one from the judge in his wig to the colonist a stirring up the dust i ll show a better gentleman than the whole kit on you put together
that ll be my pleasure my pleasure ull be fur to see him do it and blast you all stop said i almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike i want to speak to you
i want to know how you are to be kept out of danger how long you are going to stay what projects you have
look ee here mr_pip said he laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner first of all look ee here
i want to know what is to be done i forgot myself half a minute ago what i said was low that what it was low
look ee here mr_pip look over it i aint a going to be low first i resumed half groaning what precautions can be taken against your being recognized and seized
no dear boy he said in the same tone as before that dont go first lowness goes first i aint took so many year to make a gentleman not without knowing what due to him
look ee here mr_pip i was low that what i was low look over it dear boy some sense of the grimly ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh as i replied i have looked over it
in heaven name dont harp upon it yes but look ee here he persisted dear boy i aint come so fur not fur to be low
now go on dear boy you was a saying how are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred
well dear boy the danger aint so great without i was informed agen the danger aint so much to signify
there mr_jaggers and there mr_wemmick and there you who else is there to inform is there no chance person who might identify you in the street said i_
nor yet i dont intend to advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of a come back from botany bay and year have rolled away and who to gain by it
well he returned there aint many still look ee here mr_pip if the danger had been fifty time as great i should ha come to see you
mind you just the same and how long do you remain how long said he taking his black pipe from his mouth and dropping his jaw as he stared at me
i not a going back i ve come for good where are you to live said i what is to be done with you
dear boy he returned there disguising wigs can be bought for money and there hair powder and spectacles and black clothes shorts and what not
where will you be safe others has done it safe afore and what others has done afore others can do agen
as to the where and how of living dear boy give me your own opinions on it you take it smoothly now said i but you were very serious last night when you swore it was death
and so i swear it is death said he putting his pipe back in his mouth and death by the rope in the open street not fur from this and it serious that you should fully understand it to be so
what then when that once done here i am to go back now ud be as bad as to stand ground worse
as to what i dare i a old bird now as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged and i not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow
if there death hid inside of it there is and let him come out and i ll face him and then i ll believe in him and not afore
besides mr_pip i here because i ve meant it by you year and year and now let me have a look at my gentleman agen
once more he took me by both hand and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship smoking with great complacency all the while
it appeared to me that i could do no better than secure him some quiet lodging hard by of which he might take possession when herbert_pocket returned whom i expected in two or three day
that the secret must be confided to herbert_pocket as a matter of unavoidable necessity even if i could have put the immense relief i should derive from sharing it with him out of the question was plain to me
i resolved to call him by that name who reserved his consent to herbert_pocket participation until he should have seen him and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy
and even then dear boy said he pulling a greasy little clasped black testament out of his pocket we ll have him on his oath
to state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in case of emergency would be to state what i never quite established but this i can say that i never knew him put it to any other use
the book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents combined with his own experience in that wise gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm
on this first occasion of his producing it i recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude
as he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of i next discussed with him what dress he should wear
he cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of shorts as a disguise and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist
it was with considerable difficulty that i won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmer and we arranged that he should cut his hair close and wear a little powder
lastly as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made
it would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions but in my dazed not to say distracted state it took so long that i did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon
he was to remain shut up in the chambers while i was gone and was on no account to open the door
there being to my knowledge a respectable lodging house in essex street the back of which looked into the temple and was almost within hail of my window i first of all repaired to that house and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle mr_provis
but it was by no means so plain to mr_provis i then went from shop to shop making such purchases as were necessary to the change in his appearance
this business transacted i turned my face on my own account to little britain mr_jaggers was at his desk but seeing me enter got up immediately and stood before his fire
now mr_pip said he be careful i will sir i returned for coming along i had thought well of what i was going to say
dont commit yourself said mr_jaggers and dont commit any one you understand any one dont tell me anything i dont want to know anything i am not curious
of course i saw that he knew the man was come i merely want mr_jaggers said i to assure myself that what i have been told is true
i have no hope of its being untrue but at least i may verify it mr_jaggers nodded but did you say told or informed
he asked me with his head on one side and not looking at me but looking in a listening way at the floor
told would seem to imply verbal communication you cant have verbal communication with a man in new south wales you know
i will say informed mr_jaggers good i have been informed by a person named abel_magwitch that he is the benefactor so long unknown to me
that is the man said mr_jaggers in new south wales and only he said i and only he said mr_jaggers
i am not so unreasonable sir as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions but i always supposed it was miss_havisham
as you say mr_pip returned mr_jaggers turning his eye upon me coolly and taking a bite at his forefinger i am not at all responsible for that
and yet it looked so like it sir i pleaded with a downcast heart not a particle of evidence mr_pip said mr_jaggers shaking his head and gathering up his skirts
take nothing on its look take everything on evidence there no better rule i have no more to say said i with a sigh after standing silent for a little while
and abel_magwitch in new south wales having at last disclosed himself said mr_jaggers you will comprehend mr_pip how rigidly throughout my communication with you i have always adhered to the strict line of fact
i have verified my information and there an end there has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact
i communicated to abel_magwitch in new south wales when he first wrote to me from new south wales the caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact
he appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in england here
i cautioned him that i must hear no more of that that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law
you are quite aware of that quite sir i also communicated to him another caution i gave abel_magwitch that caution said mr_jaggers looking hard at me i wrote it to new south wales
i have been informed by mr_wemmick pursued mr_jaggers still looking hard at me that he has received a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist of the name of purvis or or mr_provis i suggested
he guided himself by it no doubt no doubt said i or mr_provis thank you mr_pip perhaps it is mr_provis perhaps you know it mr_provis
a letter under date portsmouth from a colonist of the name of mr_provis asking for the particulars of your address on behalf of abel_magwitch
yes said i you know it mr_provis mr_wemmick sent him the particulars i understand by return of post probably it is through mr_provis that you have received the explanation of abel_magwitch in new south wales
it came through mr_provis i replied good day mr_pip said mr_jaggers offering his hand glad to have seen you
in writing by post to abel_magwitch in new south wales or in communicating with him through mr_provis have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you together with the balance for there is still a balance remaining
i turned at the door and he was still looking hard at me while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open and to force out of their swollen throats what a man he is
good day mr_pip we shook hand and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me mr_wemmick was out and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me
i went straight back to the temple where i found the terrible mr_provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro head in safety
next day the clothes i had ordered all came home and he put them on whatever he put on became him less it dismally seemed to me than what he had worn before
the more i dressed him and the better i dressed him the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on the marsh
this effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable no doubt to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me but i believe too that he dragged one of his leg as if there were still a weight of iron on it and that from head to foot there was convict in the very grain of the man
the influences of his solitary hut life were upon him besides and gave him a savage air that no dress could tame added to these were the influences of his subsequent branded life among man and crowning all his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now
in all his way of sitting and standing and eating and drinking of brooding about in a high shouldered reluctant style of taking out his great horn handled jackknife and wiping it on his leg and cutting his food of lifting light glasses and cups to his lips as if they were clumsy pannikins of chopping a wedge off his bread and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate as if to make the most of an allowance and then drying his finger ends on it and then swallowing it in these way and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day
to my thinking there was something in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him there was prisoner felon bondsman plain as plain could be
it had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder and i had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts
but i can compare the effect of it when on to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was most desirable to repress started through that thin layer of pretence and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head
word cannot tell what a sense i had at the same time of the dreadful mystery that he was to me
when he fell asleep of an evening with his knotted hand clenching the side of the easy chair and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast i would sit and look at him wondering what he had done and loading him with all the crimes in the calendar until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him
every hour so increased my abhorrence of him that i even think i might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted notwithstanding all he had done for me and the risk he ran but for the knowledge that herbert_pocket must soon come back
once i actually did start out of bed in the night and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything else i possessed and enlist for india as a private soldier
i doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me up in those lonely room in the long evening and long night with the wind and the rain always rushing by
a ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account and the consideration that he could be and the dread that he would be were no small addition to my horrors
when he was not asleep or playing a complicated kind of patience with a ragged pack of cards of his own a game that i never saw before or since and in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits he would ask me to read to him foreign language dear boy
while i complied he not comprehending a single word would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an exhibitor and i would see him between the finger of the hand with which i shaded my face appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency
the imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made was not more wretched than i pursued by the creature who had made me and recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion the more he admired me and the fonder he was of me
it was abandoned as soon as tried and he wore his grizzled hair cut short this is written of i am sensible as if it had lasted a year
it lasted about five day expecting herbert_pocket all the time i dared not go out except when i took mr_provis for an airing after dark
at length one evening when dinner was over and i had dropped into a slumber quite worn out for my night had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams i was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase
mr_provis who had been asleep too staggered up at the noise i made and in an instant i saw his jackknife shining in his hand
quiet it herbert_pocket i said and herbert_pocket came bursting in with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of france upon him
handel my dear fellow how are you and again how are you and again how are you i seem to have been gone a twelvemonth
why so i must have been for you have grown quite thin and pale handel my halloa i beg your pardon
mr_provis regarding him with a fixed attention was slowly putting up his jackknife and groping in another pocket for something else
herbert_pocket my dear friend said i shutting the double door while herbert_pocket stood staring and wondering something very strange has happened
he was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hand with me by seeing mr_provis this is a visitor of mine
it all right dear boy said mr_provis coming forward with his little clasped black book and then addressing himself to herbert_pocket
take it in your right hand lord strike you dead on the spot if ever you split in any way sumever
so herbert_pocket looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement complied and mr_provis immediately shaking hand with him said now you re on your oath you know
kiss it do so as he wishes it i said to herbert_pocket and never believe me on mine if mr_pip shant make a gentleman on you
in vain should i attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of herbert_pocket when he and i and mr_provis sat down before the fire and i recounted the whole of the secret
enough that i saw my own feelings reflected in herbert_pocket face and not least among them my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me
what would alone have set a division between that man and us if there had been no other dividing circumstance was his triumph in my story
saving his troublesome sense of having been low on one occasion since his return on which point he began to hold forth to herbert_pocket the moment my revelation was finished he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune
his boast that he had made me a gentleman and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources was made for me quite as much as for himself
and that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us and that we must both be very proud of it
though look ee here mr_pip comrade he said to herbert_pocket after having discoursed for some time i know very well that once since i come back for half a minute i ve been low
chapter xli was a conclusion quite established in his own mind i said to mr_pip i knowed as i had been low
i aint made mr_pip a gentleman and mr_pip aint a going to make you a gentleman not fur me not to know what due to ye both
but dont you fret yourself on that score dear boy and mr_pip comrade you two may count upon me always having a gen teel muzzle on
muzzled i have been since that half a minute when i was betrayed into lowness muzzled i am at the present time muzzled i ever will be
we were anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us together but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together and sat late
it was midnight before i took him round to essex street and saw him safely in at his own dark door
when it closed upon him i experienced the first moment of relief i had known since the night of his arrival
never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs i had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark and in bringing him back and i looked about me now
difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard i could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements
the few who were passing passed on their several way and the street was empty when i turned back into the temple
herbert_pocket said certainly but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this and remained perplexed and dismayed nobody had come out at the gate with us nobody went in at the gate with me
as i crossed by the fountain i saw his lighted back window looking bright and quiet and when i stood for a few moment in the doorway of the building where i lived before going up the stairs garden court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when i ascended it
herbert_pocket received me with open arm and i had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend
when he had spoken some sound word of sympathy and encouragement we sat down to consider the question what was to be done
he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot in one unsettled manner and going through one round of observances with his pipe and his negro head and his jackknife and his pack of cards and what not as if it were all put down for him on a slate i say his chair remaining where it had stood herbert_pocket unconsciously took it but next moment started out of it pushed it away and took another
the chair that mr_provis had occupied still remaining where it had stood for he had no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my patron
neither had i occasion to confess my own we interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable what said i to herbert_pocket when he was safe in another chair what is to be done
my poor dear handel he replied holding his head i am too stunned to think so was i herbert_pocket when the blow first fell
still something must be done he is intent upon various new expenses horses and carriages and lavish appearances of all kind he must be stopped somehow
you mean that you cant accept how can i i interposed as herbert_pocket paused think of him
look at him an involuntary shudder passed over both of us yet i am afraid the dreadful truth is herbert_pocket that he is attached to me strongly attached to me
was there ever such a fate my poor dear handel herbert_pocket repeated then said i after all stopping short here never taking another penny from him think what i owe him already
then again i am heavily in debt very heavily for me who have now no expectations and i have been bred to no calling and i am fit for nothing
well well well herbert_pocket remonstrated dont say fit for nothing what am i fit for i know only one thing that i am fit for and that is to go for a soldier
and i might have gone my dear herbert_pocket but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection
of course i broke down there and of course herbert_pocket beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand pretended not to know it
if you were to renounce this patronage and these favors i suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had
anyhow my dear handel said he presently soldiering wont do not very strong that hope if you went soldiering besides it absurd
you would be infinitely better in clarriker house small as it is i am working up towards a partnership you know
poor fellow he little suspected with whose money but there is another question said herbert_pocket this is an ignorant determined man who has long had one fixed idea
more than that he seems to me i may misjudge him to be a man of a desperate and fierce character
i know he is i returned let me tell you what evidence i have seen of it and i told him what i had not mentioned in my narrative of that encounter with the other convict
see then said herbert_pocket think of this he comes here at the peril of his life for the realization of his fixed idea
in the moment of realization after all his toil and waiting you cut the ground from under his foot destroy his idea and make his gains worthless to him
do you see nothing that he might do under the disappointment i have seen it herbert_pocket and dreamed of it ever since the fatal night of his arrival
nothing has been in my thought so distinctly as his putting himself in the way of being taken then you may rely upon it said herbert_pocket that there would be great danger of his doing it
that is his power over you as long as he remains in england and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him
i was so struck by the horror of this idea which had weighed upon me from the first and the working out of which would make me regard myself in some sort as his murderer that i could not rest in my chair but began pacing to and fro
i said to herbert_pocket meanwhile that even if mr_provis were recognized and taken in spite of himself i should be wretched as the cause however innocently
yes even though i was so wretched in having him at large and near me and even though i would far rather have worked at the forge all the day of my life than i would ever have come to this
but there was no staving off the question what was to be done the first and the main thing to be done said herbert_pocket is to get him out of england
you will have to go with him and then he may be induced to go but get him where i will could i prevent his coming back
my good handel is it not obvious that with newgate in the next street there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and making him reckless here than elsewhere
if a pretext to get him away could be made out of that other convict or out of anything else in his life now
there again said i stopping before herbert_pocket with my open hand held out as if they contained the desperation of the case
it has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him before me so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes and yet so unknown to me except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two day in my childhood
i know nothing of his life herbert_pocket got up and linked his arm in mine and we slowly walked to and fro together studying the carpet
handel said herbert_pocket stopping you feel convinced that you can take no further benefits from him do you fully surely you would too if you were in my place
and you have and are bound to have that tenderness for the life he has risked on your account that you must save him if possible from throwing it away
and you feel convinced that you must break with him herbert_pocket can you ask me then you must get him out of england before you stir a finger to extricate yourself
that done extricate yourself in heaven name and we ll see it out together dear old boy it was a comfort to shake hand upon it and walk up and down again with only that done
now herbert_pocket said i with reference to gaining some knowledge of his history there is but one way that i know of
i must ask him point blank yes ask him said herbert_pocket when we sit at breakfast in the morning
for he had said on taking leave of herbert_pocket that he would come to breakfast with us with this project formed we went to bed
i had the wildest dreams concerning him and woke unrefreshed i woke too to recover the fear which i had lost in the night of his being found out as a returned transport
waking i never lost that fear he came round at the appointed time took out his jackknife and sat down to his meal
he was full of plans for his gentleman coming out strong and like a gentleman and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocket book which he had left in my possession
he considered the chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences and advised me to look out at once for a fashionable crib near hyde park in which he could have a shake down
when he had made an end of his breakfast and was wiping his knife on his leg i said to him without a word of preface after you were gone last night i told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marsh when we came up
you remember remember said he i think so we want to know something about that man and about you
it is strange to know no more about either and particularly you than i was able to tell last night is not this as good a time as another for our knowing more
well he said after consideration you re on your oath you know mr_pip comrade assuredly replied herbert_pocket as to anything i say you know he insisted
the oath applies to all i understand it to do so and look ee here wotever i done is worked out and paid for he insisted again
he took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro head when looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative
he put it back again stuck his pipe in a button hole of his coat spread a hand on each knee and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moment looked round at us and said what follows
so be it chapter xlii dear boy and mr_pip comrade i am not a going fur to tell you my life like a song or a story book
but to give it you short and handy i ll put it at once into a mouthful of english in jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail in jail and out of jail
there you ve got it that my life pretty much down to such time as i got shipped off arter mr_pip stood my friend
i ve been carted here and carted there and put out of this town and put out of that town and stuck in the stocks and whipped and worried and drove
i ve been done everything to pretty well except hanged i ve been locked up as much as a silver tea kittle i ve no more notion where i was born than you have if so much
i first become aware of myself down in essex a thieving turnips for my living summun had run away from me a man a tinker and he took the fire with him and left me wery cold
i know my name to be abel_magwitch chrisen abel_magwitch how did i know it much as i know the birds name in the hedges to be chaffinch sparrer thrush
i might have thought it was all lies together only as the birds name come out true i supposed mine did
so fur as i could find there warnt a soul that see young abel_magwitch with us little on him as in him but wot caught fright at him and either drove him off or took him up
this is the way it was that when i was a ragged little creetur as much to be pitied as ever i see not that i looked in the glass for there
i was took up took up took up to that extent that i reg larly grow up took up warnt many insides of furnished house known to me
i got the name of being hardened this is a terrible hardened one they says to prison wisitors picking out me
may be said to live in jails this boy then they looked at me and i looked at them and they measured my head some on
em they had better a measured my stomach and others on em giv me tracts what i couldnt read and made me speeches what i couldnt understand
they always went on agen me about the devil but what the devil was i to do i must put something into my stomach mustnt i howsomever
i a getting low and i know what due dear boy and mr_pip comrade dont you be afeerd of me being low
tramping begging thieving working sometimes when i could though that warnt as often as you may think till you put the question whether you would ha been over ready to give me work yourselves a bit of a poacher a bit of a laborer a bit of a wagoner a bit of a haymaker a bit of a hawker a bit of most thing that dont pay and lead to trouble i got to be a man
a deserting soldier in a traveller rest what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs learnt me to read and a travelling giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write
i warnt locked up as often now as formerly but i wore out my good share of key metal still
at epsom races a matter of over twenty year ago i got acquainted wi a man whose skull i crack wi
his right name was compeyson and that the man dear boy what you see me a pounding in the ditch according to what you truly told your comrade arter
this poker like the claw of a lobster if i got it on this hob i was gone last night
he set up fur a gentleman this compeyson and he been to a public boarding school and had learning he was a smooth one to talk and was a dab at the way of gentlefolks
he was good looking too it was the night afore the great race when i found him on the heath in a booth that i know on
him and some more was a sitting among the table when i went in and the landlord which had a knowledge of me and was a sporting one called him out and said i think this is a man that might suit you meaning
i was compeyson he look at me very noticing and i look at him he has a watch and a chain and a ring and a breast pin and a handsome suit of clothes
to judge from appearances you re out of luck says compeyson to me yes master and i ve never been in it much
i had come out of kingston jail last on a vagrancy committal not but what it might have been for something else but it warnt
luck changes says compeyson perhaps yours is going to change i says i hope it may be so there room
what can you do says compeyson eat and drink i says if you ll find the materials compeyson laughed looked at me again very noticing giv me five shillings and appointed me for next night
same place i went to compeyson next night same place and compeyson took me on to be his man and pardner
and what was compeyson business in which we was to go pardners compeyson business was the swindling handwriting forging stolen bank note passing and such like
all sorts of traps as compeyson could set with his head and keep his own leg out of and get the profits from and let another man in for was compeyson business
he no more heart than a iron file he was as cold as death and he had the head of the devil afore mentioned
there was another in with compeyson as was called arthur not as being so chrisen but as a surname he was in a decline and was a shadow to look at
him and compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some year afore and they made a pot of money by it but compeyson betted and gamed and he have run through the king taxes
so arthur was a dying and a dying poor and with the horrors on him and compeyson wife which compeyson kicked mostly was a having pity on him when she could and compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody
i might a took warning by arthur but i didnt and i wont pretend i was partick ler for where ud be the good on it dear boy and comrade
arthur lived at the top of compeyson house over nigh brentford it was and compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging in case he should ever get better to work it out
so i begun wi compeyson and a poor tool i was in his hand but arthur soon settled the account
the second or third time as ever i see him he come a tearing down into compeyson parlor late at night in only a flannel gown with his hair all in a sweat and he says to compeyson wife sally she really is upstairs alonger me now and i cant get rid of her
she all in white he says wi white flowers in her hair and she awful mad and she got a shroud hanging over her arm and
she says she ll put it on me at five in the morning says compeyson why you fool dont you know she got a living body
and how should she be up there without coming through the door or in at the window and up the stairs
i dont know how she there says arthur shivering dreadful with the horrors but she standing in the corner at the foot of the bed awful mad
and over where her heart broke you broke it there drops of blood compeyson spoke hardy but he was always a coward
go up alonger this drivelling sick man he says to his wife and abel_magwitch lend her a hand will you but he never come nigh himself
compeyson wife and me took him up to bed agen and he raved most dreadful why look at her
he cries out she a shaking the shroud at me dont you see her look at her eye aint it awful to see her so mad
next he cries she ll put it on me and then i done for take it away from her take it away
and then he catched hold of us and kep on a talking to her and answering of her till i half believed i see her myself
compeyson wife being used to him giv him some liquor to get the horrors off and by and by he quieted
she gone has her keeper been for her he says yes says compeyson wife did you tell him to lock her and bar her in
yes and to take that ugly thing away from her yes yes all right you re a good creetur he says dont leave me whatever you do and thank you
he rested pretty quiet till it might want a few minutes of five and then he starts up with a scream and screams out here she is
she got the shroud again she unfolding it she coming out of the corner she coming to the bed hold me both on you
one of each side dont let her touch me with it hah she missed me that time dont let her throw it over my shoulder
dont let her lift me up to get it round me she lifting me up keep me down then he lifted himself up hard and was dead
him and me was soon busy and first he swore me being ever artful on my own book this here little black book
compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both side dear boy what i swore your comrade on
i ll simply say to you dear boy and mr_pip comrade that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave
not to go into the thing that compeyson planned and i done which ud take a week i was always in debt to him always under his thumb always a working always a getting into danger
he was younger than me but he got craft and he got learning and he overmatched me five hundred time told and no mercy
he looked about him in a confused way as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance and he turned his face to the fire and spread his hand broader on his knees and lifted them off and put them on again
my missis as i had the hard time wi stop though i aint brought her in there aint no need to go into it he said looking round once more
the time wi compeyson was a most as hard a time as ever i had that said all said did i tell you as i was tried alone for misdemeanor while with compeyson
as to took up on suspicion that was twice or three time in the four or five year that it lasted but evidence was wanting
i answered no well he said i was and got convicted at last me and compeyson was both committed for felony on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation and
and i was so miserable poor that i sold all the clothes i had except what hung on my back afore
there was other charges behind compeyson says to me separate defences no communication and that was all i could get mr_jaggers
wi his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket handkercher and what a common sort of a wretch i looked
when the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short aforehand i noticed how heavy it all bore on me and how light on him
when the evidence was giv in the box i noticed how it was always me that had come for ard and could be swore to how it was always me that the money had been paid to how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit
but when the defence come on then i see the plan plainer for says the counsellor for compeyson my lord and gentleman here you has afore you side by side two person as your eye can separate wide one the younger well brought up who will be spoke to as such
one the elder ill brought up who will be spoke to as such one the younger seldom if ever seen in these here transactions and only suspectedt other the elder always seen in em and always wi his guilt brought home
can you doubt if there is but one in it which is the one and if there is two in it which is much the worst one
when we was put in the dock i noticed first of all what a gentleman compeyson looked and such like and when it come to character warn t
it compeyson as had been to the school and warnt it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that and warn t
it me as had been tried afore and as had been know up hill and down dale in bridewells and lock ups
it him as had been know by witnesses in such clubs and societies and nowt to his disadvantage and warnt and when it come to speech making warn t
it compeyson as could speak to em wi his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket handkercher ah and wi verses in his speech
too and warnt it me as could only say gentleman this man at my side is a most precious rascal and when the verdict come warn t
it compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company and giving up all the information he could agen me and
and when i says to compeyson once out of this court i ll smash that face of yourn aint it compeyson as prays the judge to be protected and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us
and when we re sentenced aint it him as gets seven year and me fourteen and aint it him as the judge is sorry for because he might a done so well and aint it me as the judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion likely to come to worse
he had worked himself into a state of great excitement but he checked it took two or three short breaths swallowed as often and stretching out his hand towards me said in a reassuring manner i aint a going to be low dear boy
he had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hand before he could go on
warnt it me as got never a word but guilty i had said to compeyson that i smash that face of his and i swore lord smash mine
at last i come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him when i was seen and seized
to do it we was in the same prison ship but i couldnt get at him for long though i tried the black hole of that ship warnt a strong one to a judge of black holes that could swim and dive
i escaped to the shore and i was a hiding among the graves there envying them as was in em and all over when i first see my boy
he regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent to me again though i had felt great pity for him
upon my soul i half believe he escaped in his terror to get quit of me not knowing it was me as had got ashore
by my boy i was giv to understand as compeyson was out on them marsh too i hunted him down
i smashed his face and now says i as the worst thing i can do caring nothing for myself i ll drag you back
and i have swum off towing him by the hair if it had come to that and i a got him aboard without the soldiers
of course he much the best of it to the last his character was so good he had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions and his punishment was light
i was put in irons brought to trial again and sent for life i didnt stop for life dear boy and mr_pip comrade being here
he wiped himself again as he had done before and then slowly took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket and plucked his pipe from his button hole and slowly filled it and began to smoke
is he dead i asked after a silence is who dead dear boy compeyson he hopes i am if he alive you may be sure with a fierce look
i never heerd no more of him herbert_pocket had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book
he softly pushed the book over to me as mr_provis stood smoking with his eye on the fire and i read in it young havisham name was arthur
i shut the book and nodded slightly to herbert_pocket and put the book by but we neither of us said anything and both looked at mr_provis as he stood smoking by the fire
compeyson is the man who professed to be miss_havisham lover chapter xliii why should i pause to ask how much of my shrinking from mr_provis might be traced to miss_estella
why should i loiter on my road to compare the state of mind in which i had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting her at the coach office with the state of mind in which i now reflected on the abyss between miss_estella in her pride and beauty and the returned transport whom i harbored
the road would be none the smoother for it the end would be none the better for it he would not be helped nor i extenuated
a new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative or rather his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there
that compeyson stood in mortal fear of him neither of the two could know much better than i and that any such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer was scarcely to be imagined
if compeyson were alive and should discover his return i could hardly doubt the consequence never had i breathed and never would i breathe or
so i resolved a word of miss_estella to mr_provis but i said to herbert_pocket that before i could go abroad i must see both miss_estella and miss_havisham
this was when we were left alone on the night of the day when mr_provis told us his story i resolved to go out to richmond next day and i went
on my presenting myself at mrs brandley miss_estella maid was called to tell that miss_estella had gone into the country where
to satis house as usual not as usual i said for she had never yet gone there without me when was she coming back
there was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity and the answer was that her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while
i could make nothing of this except that it was meant that i should make nothing of it and i went home again in complete discomfiture
another night consultation with herbert_pocket after mr_provis was gone home i always took him home and always looked well about me led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until i came back from miss_havisham
in the mean time herbert_pocket and i were to consider separately what it would be best to say whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation or whether i who had never yet been abroad should propose an expedition
we both knew that i had but to propose anything and he would consent we agreed that his remaining many day in his present hazard was not to be thought of
next day i had the meanness to feign that i was under a binding promise to go down to mrs_joe_gargery but i was capable of almost any meanness towards mrs_joe_gargery or his name
mr_provis was to be strictly careful while i was gone and herbert_pocket was to take the charge of him that i had taken
i was to be absent only one night and on my return the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun
it occurred to me then and as i afterwards found to herbert_pocket also that he might be best got away across the water on that pretence as to make purchases or the like
having thus cleared the way for my expedition to miss_havisham i set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on halting and whimpering and shivering and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist like a beggar
when we drove up to the blue_boar after a drizzly ride whom should i see come out under the gateway toothpick in hand to look at the coach but mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle
as he pretended not to see me i pretended not to see him it was a very lame pretence on both side
the lamer because we both went into the coffee room where he had just finished his breakfast and where i ordered mine
it was poisonous to me to see him in the town for i very well knew why he had come there
pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date which had nothing half so legible in its local news as the foreign matter of coffee pickles fish sauces gravy melted butter and wine with which it was sprinkled all over as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form i sat at my table while he stood before the fire
by degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the fire and i got up determined to have my share of it
i had to put my hand behind his leg for the poker when i went up to the fireplace to stir the fire but still pretended not to know him
is this a cut said mr_drummle oh said i poker in hand it you is it how do you do
with that i poked tremendously and having done so planted myself side by side with mr_drummle my shoulder squared and my back to the fire
i was wondering who it was who kept the fire off you have just come down said mr_drummle edging me a little away with his shoulder
yes said i edging him a little away with my shoulder beastly place said mr_drummle your part of the country i think
yes i assented i am told it very like your shropshire not in the least like it said mr_drummle
here mr_drummle looked at his boots and i looked at mine and then mr_drummle looked at my boots and i looked at his
have you been here long i asked determined not to yield an inch of the fire long enough to be tired of it returned mr_drummle pretending to yawn but equally determined
i felt here through a tingling in my blood that if mr_drummle shoulder had claimed another hair breadth of room i should have jerked him into the window equally that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim mr_drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box
do you stay here long cant say answered mr_drummle do you cant say said i he whistled a little
what of that said i mr_drummle looked at me and then at my boots and then said oh and laughed
so did i large tract of marsh about here i believe said mr_drummle yes are you amused mr_drummle
no said he not particularly i am going out for a ride in the saddle i mean to explore those marsh for amusement
out of the way villages there they tell me curious little public house and smithies and that waiter yes sir is that horse of mine ready
brought round to the door sir i say look here you sir the lady wont ride to day the weather wont do
then mr_drummle glanced at me with an insolent triumph on his great jowled face that cut me to the heart dull as he was and so exasperated me that i felt inclined to take him in my arm as the robber in the story book is said to have taken the old lady and seat him on the fire
one thing was manifest to both of us and that was that until relief came neither of us could relinquish the fire
there we stood well squared up before it shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot with our hand behind us not budging an inch
the horse was visible outside in the drizzle at the door my breakfast was put on the table mr_drummle was cleared away the waiter invited me to begin i nodded we both stood our ground
very good sir and i dont dine because i going to dine at the lady very good sir
have you been to the grove since said mr_drummle no said i i had quite enough of the finches the last time i was there
was that when we had a difference of opinion yes i replied very shortly come come they let you off easily enough sneered mr_drummle
you shouldnt have lost your temper mr_drummle said i you are not competent to give advice on that subject
when i lose my temper not that i admit having done so on that occasion i dont throw glasses i do said mr_drummle
after glancing at him once or twice in an increased state of smouldering ferocity i said mr_drummle i did not seek this conversation and i dont think it an agreeable one
i am sure it not said he superciliously over his shoulder i dont think anything about it and therefore i went on with your leave i will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future
quite my opinion said mr_drummle and what i should have suggested myself or done more likely without suggesting but dont lose your temper
havent you lost enough without that what do you mean sir waiter said mr_drummle by way of answering me
the waiter reappeared look here you sir you quite understand that the young lady dont ride to day and that i dine at the young lady
when the waiter had felt my fast cooling teapot with the palm of his hand and had looked imploringly at me and had gone out mr_drummle careful not to move the shoulder next me took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off but showed no sign of stirring
choking and boiling as i was i felt that we could not go a word further without introducing miss_estella name which i could not endure to hear him utter and therefore i looked stonily at the opposite wall as if there were no one present and forced myself to silence
how long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say but for the incursion of three thriving farmers laid on by the waiter i think who came into the coffee room unbuttoning their great coats and rubbing their hand and before whom as they charged at the fire we were obliged to give way
i saw him through the window seizing his horse mane and mounting in his blundering brutal manner and sidling and backing away
i thought he was gone when he came back calling for a light for the cigar in his mouth which he had forgotten
a man in a dust colored dress appeared with what was wanted i could not have said from where whether from the inn yard or the street or where not and as mr_drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed with a jerk of his head towards the coffee room window the slouching shoulder and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of old_orlick
too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or no or after all to touch the breakfast i washed the weather and the journey from my face and hand and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered never to have seen
in the room where the dressing table stood and where the wax candles burnt on the wall i found miss_havisham and miss_estella miss_havisham seated on a settee near the fire and miss_estella on a cushion at her foot
quite so sir chapter xliv miss_estella was knitting and miss_havisham was looking on they both raised their eye as i went in and both saw an alteration in me
i derived that from the look they interchanged and what wind said miss_havisham blows you here mr_pip though she looked steadily at me i saw that she was rather confused
miss_estella pausing a moment in her knitting with her eye upon me and then going on i fancied that i read in the action of her finger as plainly
miss_havisham said i i went to richmond yesterday to speak to miss_estella and finding that some wind had blown her here i followed
as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet that she perceived i had discovered my real benefactor
miss_havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down i took the chair by the dressing table which i had often seen her occupy
with all that ruin at my foot and about me it seemed a natural place for me that day what i had to say to miss_estella miss_havisham i will say before you presently in a few moment
it will not surprise you it will not displease you i am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be
i could see in the action of miss_estella finger as they worked that she attended to what i said but she did not look up
miss_havisham continued to look steadily at me i have found out who my patron is it is not a fortunate discovery and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation station fortune anything
as i was silent for a while looking at miss_estella and considering how to go on miss_havisham repeated it is not your secret but another
when you first caused me to be brought here miss_havisham when i belonged to the village over yonder that i wish i had never left i suppose i did really come here as any other chance boy might have come as a kind of servant to gratify a want or a whim and to be paid for it
there are reason why i must say no more of that it is not my secret but another well ay mr_pip replied miss_havisham steadily nodding her head you did
and that mr_jaggers mr_jaggers said miss_havisham taking me up in a firm tone had nothing to do with it and knew nothing of it
his being my lawyer and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence he holds the same relation towards numbers of people and it might easily arise
be that as it may it did arise and was not brought about by any one any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far
but when i fell into the mistake i have so long remained in at least you led me on said i yes she returned again nodding steadily i let you go on
who am i cried miss_havisham striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that miss_estella glanced up at her in surprise who am i for god sake that i should be kind
was that kind it was a weak complaint to have made and i had not meant to make it
i told her so as she sat brooding after this outburst well well well she said what else
i was liberally paid for my old attendance here i said to soothe her in being apprenticed and i have asked these question only for my own information
in humoring my mistake miss_havisham you punished practised on perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention without offence your self seeking relations
what follows has another and i hope more disinterested purpose i did why they would have it so so would you
what has been my history that i should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so
you made your own snares i never made them waiting until she was quiet again for this too flashed out of her in a wild and sudden way i went on
i have been thrown among one family of your relations miss_havisham and have been constantly among them since i went to london
and i should be false and base if i did not tell you whether it is acceptable to you or no and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no that you deeply wrong both mr_matthew_pocket and his son herbert_pocket if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous upright open and incapable of anything designing or mean
i know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as i myself they are your friend said miss_havisham
they made themselves my friend said i when they supposed me to have superseded them and when miss_sarah_pocket miss_georgiana and mistress mrs_camilla were not my friend i think
this contrasting of them with the rest seemed i was glad to see to do them good with her
she looked at me keenly for a little while and then said quietly what do you want for them only said i that you would not confound them with the others
they may be of the same blood but believe me they are not of the same nature still looking at me keenly miss_havisham repeated
conscious that i reddened a little as that i could hide from you even if i desired that i do want something
miss_havisham if you would spare the money to do my friend herbert_pocket a lasting service in life but which from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge i could show you how
what do you want for them i am not so cunning you see i said in answer why must it be done without his knowledge
because said i i began the service myself more than two year ago without his knowledge and i dont want to be betrayed
she asked settling her hand upon her stick that she might regard me the more attentively why i fail in my ability to finish it i cannot explain
it is a part of the secret which is another person and not mine she gradually withdrew her eye from me and turned them on the fire
after watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals and looked towards me again at first vacantly then with a gradually concentrating attention
when miss_havisham had fixed her attention on me she said speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue
all this time miss_estella knitted on what else miss_estella said i turning to her now and trying to command my trembling voice you know i love you
she raised her eye to my face on being thus addressed and her finger plied their work and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance
you know that i have loved you long and dearly i saw that miss_havisham glanced from me to her and from her to me
i should have said this sooner but for my long mistake it induced me to hope that miss_havisham meant us for one another
while i thought you could not help yourself as it were i refrained from saying it but i must say it now
preserving her unmoved countenance and with her finger still going miss_estella shook her head i know said i in answer to that action i know
i have no hope that i shall ever call you mine miss_estella i am ignorant what may become of me very soon
how poor i may be or where i may go still i love you i have loved you ever since i first saw you in this house
it would have been cruel in miss_havisham horribly cruel to practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy and to torture me through all these year with a vain hope and an idle pursuit if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did
looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her finger busy she shook her head again but i think she did not
i saw miss_havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there as she sat looking by turns at miss_estella and at me
i think that in the endurance of her own trial she forgot mine miss_estella it seems said miss_estella very calmly that there are sentiments fancies i dont know how to call them which
i am not able to comprehend when you say you love me i know what you mean as a form of word but nothing more
you address nothing in my breast you touch nothing there i dont care for what you say at all i have tried to warn you of this now have i not
i said in a miserable manner yes yes but you would not be warned for you thought i did not mean it
now did you not think so i thought and hoped you could not mean it you so young untried and beautiful miss_estella
surely it is not in nature it is in my nature she returned and then she added with a stress upon the word it is in the nature formed within me
i make a great difference between you and all other people when i say so much i can do no more
is it not true said i that mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle is in town here and pursuing you it is quite true she replied referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt
that you encourage him and ride out with him and that he dines with you this very day she seemed a little surprised that i should know it but again replied quite true
you cannot love him miss_estella her finger stopped for the first time as she retorted rather angrily what have i told you
do you still think in spite of it that i do not mean what i say you would never marry him miss_estella
she looked towards miss_havisham and considered for a moment with her work in her hand then she said why not tell you the truth
i dropped my face into my hand but was able to control myself better than i could have expected considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those word
when i raised my face again there was such a ghastly look upon miss_havisham that it impressed me even in my passionate hurry and grief
i am going to be married to him miss_estella dearest miss_estella do not let miss_havisham lead you into this fatal step
miss_havisham gives you to him as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better man who admire you and to the few who truly love you
among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly though he has not loved you as long as i take him and i can bear it better for your sake
my earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind
put me aside for ever you have done so i well know but bestow yourself on some worthier person than mr_drummle
i am going she said again in a gentler voice to be married to him the preparations for my marriage are making and i shall be married soon
why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption it is my own act your own act miss_estella to fling yourself away upon a brute
should i fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel if people do feel such thing that i took nothing to him
on whom should i fling myself away she retorted with a smile there it is done i shall do well enough and so will my husband
as to leading me into what you call this fatal step miss_havisham would have had me wait and not marry yet but i am tired of the life i have led which has very few charms for me and i am willing enough to change it
say no more we shall never understand each other such a mean brute such a stupid brute i urged in despair
dont be afraid of my being a blessing to him said miss_estella i shall not be that come here is my hand
i answered as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand do what i would to restrain them even if i remained in england and could hold my head up with the rest how could i see you mr_drummle wife
do we part on this you visionary boy or man miss_estella nonsense she returned nonsense this will pass in no time
never miss_estella you will get me out of your thought in a week out of my thought you are part of my existence part of myself
you have been in every line i have ever read since i first came here the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then
you have been in every prospect i have ever seen since on the river on the sails of the ships on the marsh in the clouds in the light in the darkness in the wind in the woods in the sea in the streets
the stones of which the strongest london buildings are made are not more real or more impossible to be displaced by your hand than your presence and influence have been to me there and everywhere and will be
miss_estella to the last hour of my life you cannot choose but remain part of my character part of the little good in me part of the evil
but in this separation i associate you only with the good and i will faithfully hold you to that always for you must have done me far more good than harm let me feel now what sharp distress i may
you have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with god bless you god forgive you
in what ecstasy of unhappiness i got these broken word out of myself i dont know the rhapsody welled up within me like blood from an inward wound and gushed out
i remembered and soon afterwards with stronger reason that while miss_estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder the spectral figure of miss_havisham her hand still covering her heart seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse
i held her hand to my lips some lingering moment and so i left her but ever afterwards all done all gone
so much was done and gone that when i went out at the gate the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when i went in
for a while i hid myself among some lanes and by paths and then struck off to walk all the way to london
for i had by that time come to myself so far as to consider that i could not go back to the inn and see mr_drummle there that i could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to that i could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out
pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the middlesex shore of the river my readiest access to the temple was close by the river side through whitefriars
i was not expected till to morrow but i had my keys and if herbert_pocket were gone to bed could get to bed myself without disturbing him
as it seldom happened that i came in at that whitefriars gate after the temple was closed and as i was very muddy and weary i did not take it ill that the night porter examined me with much attention as he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in
it was past midnight when i crossed london bridge to help his memory i mentioned my name i was not quite sure sir but i thought so
here a note sir the messenger that brought it said would you be so good as read it by my lantern
it was directed to philip mr_pip esquire and on the top of the superscription were the word please read this here
much surprised by the request i took the note i opened it the watchman holding up his light and read inside in mr_wemmick writing
chapter xlv turning from the temple gate as soon as i had read the warning i made the best of my way to fleet street and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the hummums in covent garden
in those time a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night and the chamberlain letting me in at his ready wicket lighted the candle next in order on his shelf and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list
it was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back with a despotic monster of a four post bedstead in it straddling over the whole place putting one of his arbitrary leg into the fireplace and another into the doorway and squeezing the wretched little washing stand in quite a divinely righteous manner
as i had asked for a night light the chamberlain had brought me in before he left me the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous day an object like the ghost of a walking cane which instantly broke its back if it were touched which nothing could ever be lighted at and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide awake pattern on the wall
when i had got into bed and lay there footsore weary and wretched i found that i could no more close my own eye than i could close the eye of this foolish argus
dont go home and thus in the gloom and death of the night we stared at one another what a doleful night
there was an inhospitable smell in the room of cold soot and hot dust and as i looked up into the corner of the tester over my head i thought what a number of blue bottle flies from the butchers and earwigs from the market and grubs from the country must be holding on up there lying by for next summer
this led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down and then i fancied that i felt light falls on my face a disagreeable turn of thought suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back
how anxious how dismal how long when i had lain awake a little while those extraordinary voice with which silence teems began to make themselves audible
at about the same time the eye on the wall acquired a new expression and in every one of those staring rounds i saw written dont go home
the closet whispered the fireplace sighed the little washing stand ticked and one guitar string played occasionally in the chest of drawers whatever night fancies and night noises crowded on me they never warded off this dont go home
not long before i had read in the newspapers how a gentleman unknown had come to the hummums in the night and had gone to bed and had destroyed himself and had been found in the morning weltering in blood
it came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine and i got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about then opened the door to look out into the passages and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light near which i knew the chamberlain to be dozing
but all this time why i was not to go home and what had happened at home and when i should go home and whether mr_provis was safe at home were question occupying my mind so busily that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme
even when i thought of miss_estella and how we had parted that day forever and when i recalled all the circumstance of our parting and all her look and tones and the action of her finger while she knitted even
it plaited itself into whatever i thought of as a bodily pain would have done then i was pursuing here and there and everywhere
when at last i dozed in sheer exhaustion of mind and body it became a vast shadowy verb which i had to conjugate
imperative mood present tense do not thou go home let him not go home let us not go home do not ye or you go home
then potentially i may not and i cannot go home and i might not could not would not and should not go home until i felt that i was going distracted and rolled over on the pillow and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again
i had left directions that i was to be called at seven for it was plain that i must see mr_wemmick before seeing any one else and equally plain that this was a case in which his walworth sentiments only could be taken
it was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable and i needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed
the caution dont go home let not them go home the castle battlements arose upon my view at eight clock
the little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls i passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company and so came without announcement into the presence of mr_wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the aged
an open door afforded a perspective view of the aged in bed halloa mr_pip said mr_wemmick you did come home then
yes i returned but i didnt go home that all right said he rubbing his hand i left a note for you at each of the temple gate on the chance
which gate did you come to i told him i ll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes said mr_wemmick
it a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it because you dont know when it may be put in
i going to take a liberty with you would you mind toasting this sausage for the aged i said i should be delighted to do it
then you can go about your work mary anne said mr_wemmick to the little servant which leaves us to ourselves dont you see mr_pip
i thanked him for his friendship and caution and our discourse proceeded in a low tone while i toasted the aged sausage and he buttered the crumb of the aged roll
he added winking as she disappeared now mr_pip you know said mr_wemmick you and i understand one another
we are in our private and personal capacities and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to day official sentiments are one thing
i was so very nervous that i had already lighted the aged sausage like a torch and been obliged to blow it out
i accidentally heard yesterday morning said mr_wemmick being in a certain place where i once took you even between you and me it as well not to mention name when avoidable much better not said i_
i heard there by chance yesterday morning said mr_wemmick that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits and not unpossessed of portable property i dont know who it may really be we wont name this person not necessary said i had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go not always in gratification of their own inclinations and not quite irrespective of the government expense
in watching his face i made quite a firework of the aged sausage and greatly discomposed both my own attention and mr_wemmick for which i apologized
we are extra official i cordially assented i understand you by disappearing from such place and being no more heard of thereabouts
from which said mr_wemmick conjectures had been raised and theories formed i also heard that you at your chambers in garden court temple had been watched and might be watched again
by whom said i i wouldnt go into that said mr_wemmick evasively it might clash with official responsibilities i heard it as i have in my time heard other curious thing in the same place
he took the toasting fork and sausage from me as he spoke and set forth the aged breakfast neatly on a little tray
previous to placing it before him he went into the aged room with a clean white cloth and tied the same under the old gentleman chin and propped him up and put his nightcap on one side and gave him quite a rakish air
i dont tell it you on information received i heard it then he placed his breakfast before him with great care and said all right aint you aged
as there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the aged was not in a presentable state and was therefore to be considered invisible i made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings
this watching of me at my chambers which i have once had reason to suspect i said to mr_wemmick when he came back is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted is it
to which the cheerful aged replied all right john my boy all right mr_wemmick looked very serious
i couldnt undertake to say that of my own knowledge i mean i couldnt undertake to say it was at first
as i saw that he was restrained by fealty to little britain from saying as much as he could and as i knew with thankfulness to him how far out of his way he went to say what he did i could not press him
but i told him after a little meditation over the fire that i would like to ask him a question subject to his answering or not answering as he deemed right and sure that his course would be right
he paused in his breakfast and crossing his arm and pinching his shirt sleeves his notion of in door comfort was to sit without any coat he nodded to me once to put my question
but it either is or it will be or it in great danger of being you have heard of a man of bad character whose true name is compeyson
he gave me one other nod compressed the post office exceedingly gave me one last nod and went on with his breakfast
now said mr_wemmick questioning being over which he emphasized and repeated for my guidance i come to what i did after hearing what i heard
he answered with one other nod is he living one other nod is he in london i went to garden court to find you not finding you i went to clarriker to find mr herbert_pocket
without mentioning any name or going into any details i gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody tom jack or richard being about the chambers or about the immediate neighborhood he had better get tom jack or richard out of the way while you were out of the way
and him you found said i with great anxiety and him i found he would be greatly puzzled what to do
he was puzzled what to do not the less because i gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get tom jack or richard too far out of the way at present
mr_pip i ll tell you something under existing circumstance there is no place like a great city when you are once in it
dont break cover too soon lie close wait till thing slacken before you try the open even for foreign air
i thanked him for his valuable advice and asked him what herbert_pocket had done mr herbert_pocket said mr_wemmick after being all of a heap for half an hour struck out a plan
he mentioned to me as a secret that he is courting a young lady who has as no doubt you are aware a bedridden
which pa having been in the purser line of life lies a bed in a bow window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river
not personally said i the truth was that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did herbert_pocket no good and
that when herbert_pocket had first proposed to present me to her she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth that herbert_pocket had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me with a view to the lapse of a little time before i made her acquaintance
when i had begun to advance herbert_pocket prospects by stealth i had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy he and his affianced for their part had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews and thus although i was assured that i had risen in clara esteem and although the young lady and i had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by herbert_pocket i had never seen her
the house with the bow window said mr_wemmick being by the river side down the pool there between limehouse and greenwich and being kept it seems by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let mr herbert_pocket put it to me what did i think of that as a temporary tenement for tom jack or richard
pa you are acquainted with the young lady most probably however i did not trouble mr_wemmick with these particulars now i thought very well of it for three reason i ll give you
that is to say firstly it altogether out of all your beats and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small
secondly without going near it yourself you could always hear of the safety of tom jack or richard through mr herbert_pocket
after a while and when it might be prudent if you should want to slip tom jack or richard on board a foreign packet boat there he is ready
thirdly much comforted by these considerations i thanked mr_wemmick again and again and begged him to proceed well sir
mr herbert_pocket threw himself into the business with a will and by nine clock last night he housed tom jack or richard whichever
at the old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to dover and in fact he was taken down the dover road and cornered out of it
now another great advantage of all this is that it was done without you and when if any one was concerning himself about your movements you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged
this diverts suspicion and confuses it and for the same reason i recommended that even if you came back last night you should not go home
it may be you and i dont want to know quite successfully it brings in more confusion and you want confusion mr_wemmick having finished his breakfast here looked at his watch and began to get his coat on
and now mr_pip said he with his hand still in the sleeves i have probably done the most i can do but if i can ever do more from a walworth point of view and in a strictly private and personal capacity i shall be glad to do it
there can be no harm in your going here to night and seeing for yourself that all is well with tom jack or richard before you go home which is another reason for your not going home last night
you are very welcome i am sure mr_pip his hand were now out of his sleeves and i was shaking them and let me finally impress one important point upon you
here the address but after you have gone home dont go back here he laid his hand upon my shoulder and added in a solemn whisper
avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property you dont know what may happen to him dont let anything happen to the portable property
quite despairing of making my mind clear to mr_wemmick on this point i forbore to try time up said mr_wemmick and i must be off
if you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark that what i should advise you look very much worried and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the aged he ll
be up presently and a little bit of you remember the pig of course said i well and a little bit of him
that sausage you toasted was his and he was in all respects a first rater do try him if it is only for old acquaintance sake
good bye aged parent in a cheery shout all right john all right my boy piped the old man from within
i soon fell asleep before mr_wemmick fire and the aged and i enjoyed one another society by falling asleep before it more or less all day
we had loin of pork for dinner and greens grown on the estate and i nodded at the aged with a good intention whenever i failed to do it drowsily
when it was quite dark i left the aged preparing the fire for toast and i inferred from the number of teacups as well as from his glances at the two little door in the wall that miss_skiffins was expected
eight clock had struck before i got into the air that was scented not disagreeably by the chips and shavings of the long shore boat builders and mast oar and block makers
all that water side region of the upper and lower pool below bridge was unknown ground to me and when i struck down by the river i found that the spot i wanted was not where i had supposed it to be and was anything but easy to find
it was called mill pond bank chinks basin and i had no other guide to chinks basin than the old green copper rope walk
it matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks i lost myself among what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide what yards of ship builders and ship breakers what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground though for year off duty what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber how many rope walks that were not the old green copper
after several time falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it i came unexpectedly round a corner upon mill pond bank
it was a fresh kind of place all circumstance considered where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round and there were two or three trees in it and there was the stump of a ruined windmill and there was the old green copper rope walk whose long and narrow vista
chapter xlvi i could trace in the moonlight along a series of wooden frames set in the ground that looked like superannuated haymaking rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth
selecting from the few queer house upon mill pond bank a house with a wooden front and three stories of bow window not bay window which is another thing i looked at the plate upon the door and read there mrs whimple
that being the name i wanted i knocked and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded she was immediately deposed however by herbert_pocket who silently led me into the parlor and shut the door
it was an odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region and i found myself looking at him much as i looked at the corner cupboard with the glass and china the shells upon the chimney piece and the colored engravings on the wall representing the death of captain cook a ship launch and his majesty king george the third in a state coachman wig leather breeches and top boots on the terrace at windsor
my dear girl is with her father and if you ll wait till she comes down i ll make you known to her and then we ll go upstairs
all is well handel said herbert_pocket and he is quite satisfied though eager to see you that her father
i had become aware of an alarming growling overhead and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance i am afraid he is a sad old rascal said herbert_pocket smiling but i have never seen him
dont you smell rum he is always at it at rum said i yes returned herbert_pocket and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout
he persists too in keeping all the provisions upstairs in his room and serving them out he keeps them on shelves over his head and will weigh them all
his room must be like a chandler shop while he thus spoke the growling noise became a prolonged roar and then died away
a man with the gout in his right hand and everywhere else cant expect to get through a double gloucester without hurting himself
what else can be the consequence said herbert_pocket in explanation if he will cut the cheese he seemed to have hurt himself very much for he gave another furious roar
to have mr_provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to mrs whimple said herbert_pocket for of course people in general wont stand that noise
a curious place handel isnt it it was a curious place indeed but remarkably well kept and clean
mrs whimple said herbert_pocket when i told him so is the best of housewives and i really do not know what my clara would do without her motherly help
for clara has no mother of her own handel and no relation in the world but old gruffandgrim surely that not his name herbert_pocket
but what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family
herbert_pocket had told me on former occasion and now reminded me that he first knew miss clara barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at hammersmith and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father he and she had confided their affection to the motherly mrs whimple by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion ever since
it was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old barley by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than gout rum and purser stores
as we were thus conversing in a low tone while old barley sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling the room door opened and a very pretty slight dark eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand whom herbert_pocket tenderly relieved of the basket and presented blushing as clara
she really was a most charming girl and might have passed for a captive fairy whom that truculent ogre old barley had pressed into his service
look here said herbert_pocket showing me the basket with a compassionate and tender smile after we had talked a little here poor clara supper served out every night
no no said herbert_pocket that my name for him his name is mr barley here her allowance of bread and here her slice of cheese and here her rum which
two mutton chops three potatoes some split peas a little flour two ounces of butter a pinch of salt and all this black pepper
i drink this is mr barley breakfast for to morrow served out to be cooked it stewed up together and taken hot and it a nice thing for the gout i should think
there was something so natural and winning in clara resigned way of looking at these stores in detail as herbert_pocket pointed them out and something so confiding loving and innocent in her modest manner of yielding herself to herbert_pocket embracing arm and something so gentle in her so much needing protection on mill pond bank by chinks basin and the old green copper rope walk with old barley growling in the beam that i would not have undone the engagement between her and herbert_pocket for all the money in the pocket book
i was looking at her with pleasure and admiration when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again and a frightful bumping noise was heard above as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us
i had never opened upon this clara said to herbert_pocket papa wants me darling and ran away there is an unconscionable old shark for you said herbert_pocket
what do you suppose he wants now handel i dont know said i something to drink that it cried herbert_pocket as if i had made a guess of extraordinary merit
he keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table wait a moment and you ll hear clara lift him up to take some
there he goes another roar with a prolonged shake at the end now said herbert_pocket as it was succeeded by silence he drinking
now said herbert_pocket as the growl resounded in the beam once more he down again on his back clara returned soon afterwards and herbert_pocket accompanied me upstairs to see our charge
as we passed mr barley door he was heard hoarsely muttering within in a strain that rose and fell like wind the following refrain in which i substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse
ahoy bless your eye here old bill_barley here old bill_barley bless your eye here old bill_barley on the flat of his back by the lord
lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder here your old bill_barley bless your eye
in this strain of consolation herbert_pocket informed me the invisible barley would commune with himself by the day and night together
often while it was light having at the same time one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river
in his two cabin room at the top of the house which were fresh and airy and in which mr barley was less audible than below i found mr_provis comfortably settled
he expressed no alarm and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning but it struck me that he was softened indefinably for i could not have said how and could never afterwards recall how when i tried but certainly
the opportunity that the day rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting compeyson
for anything i knew his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction
therefore when herbert_pocket and i sat down with him by his fire i asked him first of all whether he relied on mr_wemmick judgment and sources of information
then i have talked with mr_wemmick said i and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advice
i did accurately with the reservation just mentioned and i told him how mr_wemmick had heard in newgate prison whether from officers or prisoners i could not say that he was under some suspicion and that my chambers had been watched how mr_wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time and my keeping away from him and what mr_wemmick had said about getting him abroad
i added that of course when the time came i should go with him or should follow close upon him as might be safest in mr_wemmick judgment
what was to follow that i did not touch upon neither indeed was i at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind now that i saw him in that softer condition and in declared peril for my sake
as to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses i put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstance it would not be simply ridiculous if it were no worse
ahoy bless you ay ay dear boy he answered with a grave nod mr_jaggers knows this he could not deny this and indeed was very reasonable throughout
he would do nothing to make it a desperate venture and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help
herbert_pocket who had been looking at the fire and pondering here said that something had come into his thought arising out of mr_wemmick suggestion which it might be worth while to pursue
his coming back was a venture he said and he had always known it to be a venture we are both good watermen handel and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes
no boat would then be hired for the purpose and no boatmen that would save at least a chance of suspicion and any chance is worth saving
never mind the season dont you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the temple stairs and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river
you fall into that habit and then who notices or mind do it twenty or fifty time and there is nothing special in your doing it
we agreed that it should be carried into execution and that mr_provis should never recognize us if we came below bridge and rowed past mill pond bank
but we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east whenever he saw us and all was right
our conference being now ended and everything arranged i rose to go remarking to herbert_pocket that he and i had better not go home together and that i would take half an hour start of him
i dont like to leave you here i said to mr_provis though i cannot doubt your being safer here than near me
the twenty first or fifty first i liked this scheme and mr_provis was quite elated by it good bye dear boy he answered clasping my hand i dont know when we may meet again and i dont like good bye
say good night good night herbert_pocket will go regularly between us and when the time comes you may be certain i shall be ready
we thought it best that he should stay in his own room and we left him on the landing outside his door holding a light over the stair rail to light us downstairs
looking back at him i thought of the first night of his return when our positions were reversed and when i little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now
old barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease
good night good night when we got to the foot of the stairs i asked herbert_pocket whether he had preserved the name of mr_provis
he also explained that the utmost known of mr campbell there was that he herbert_pocket had mr campbell consigned to him and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for and living a secluded life
so when we went into the parlor where mrs whimple and clara were seated at work i said nothing of my own interest in mr campbell but kept it to myself
when i had taken leave of the pretty gentle dark eyed girl and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love i felt as if the old green copper rope walk had grown quite a different place
old barley might be as old as the hills and might swear like a whole field of troopers but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in chinks basin to fill it to overflowing
he replied certainly not and that the lodger was mr campbell and then i thought of miss_estella and of our parting and went home very sadly
the window of the room on that side lately occupied by mr_provis were dark and still and there was no lounger in garden court
i walked past the fountain twice or thrice before i descended the steps that were between me and my room but i was quite alone
all thing were as quiet in the temple as ever i had seen them herbert_pocket coming to my bedside when he came in for i went straight to bed dispirited and fatigued made the same report
opening one of the window after that he looked out into the moonlight and told me that the pavement was as solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour
it was soon done and the boat was brought round to the temple stairs and lay where i could reach her within a minute or two
next day i set myself to get the boat then i began to go out as for training and practice sometimes alone sometimes with herbert_pocket
i was often out in cold rain and sleet but nobody took much note of me after i had been out a few time
it was old london bridge in those day and at certain state of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation
but i knew well enough how to shoot the bridge after seeing it done and so began to row about among the shipping in the pool and down to erith
the first time i passed mill pond bank herbert_pocket and i were pulling a pair of oars and both in going and returning we saw the blind towards the east come down
herbert_pocket was rarely there less frequently than three time in a week and he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming
still i knew that there was cause for alarm and i could not get rid of the notion of being watched
once received it is a haunting idea how many undesigning person i suspected of watching me it would be hard to calculate
at first i kept above blackfriars bridge but as the hour of the tide changed i took towards london bridge in short i was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding
herbert_pocket had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our window after dark when the tide was running down and to think that it was flowing with everything it bore towards clara
but i thought with dread that it was flowing towards abel_magwitch and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers going swiftly silently and surely to take him
if i had never known him out of little britain and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the castle i might have doubted him not so for a moment knowing him as i did
chapter xlvii some weeks passed without bringing any change we waited for mr_wemmick and he made no sign my worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance and i was pressed for money by more than one creditor
even i myself began to know the want of money i mean of ready money in my own pocket and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash
but i had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thought and plans
therefore i had sent him the unopened pocket book by herbert_pocket to hold in his own keeping and i felt a kind of satisfaction whether it was a false kind or a true i hardly know in not having profited by his generosity since his revelation of himself
fearful of having it confirmed though it was all but a conviction i avoided the newspapers and begged herbert_pocket to whom i had confided the circumstance of our last interview never to speak of her to me
why i hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds how do i know
as the time wore on an impression settled heavily upon me that miss_estella was married why did you who read this commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year last month last week
it was an unhappy life that i lived and its one dominant anxiety towering over all its other anxieties like a high mountain above a range of mountains never disappeared from my view
let me start from my bed as i would with the terror fresh upon me that he was discovered let me sit listening as i would with dread for herbert_pocket returning step at night lest it should be fleeter than ordinary and winged with evil news for all that and much more to like purpose the round of thing went on
condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense i rowed about in my boat and waited waited waited as i best could
there were state of the tide when having been down the river i could not get back through the eddy chafed arches and starlings of old london bridge then i left my boat at a wharf near the custom house to be brought up afterwards to the temple stairs
i was not averse to doing this as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the water side people there
still no new cause for fear arose from this slight occasion sprang two meetings that i have now to tell of
one afternoon late in the month of february i came ashore at the wharf at dusk i had pulled down as far as greenwich with the ebb tide and had turned with the tide
it had been a fine bright day but had become foggy as the sun dropped and i had had to feel my way back among the shipping pretty carefully
as it was a raw evening and i was cold i thought i would comfort myself with dinner at once and as i had hour of dejection and solitude before me if i went home to the temple i thought i would afterwards go to the play
the theatre where mr_wopsle had achieved his questionable triumph was in that water side neighborhood it is nowhere now and to that theatre i resolved to go
i was aware that mr_wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the drama but on the contrary had rather partaken of its decline
he had been ominously heard of through the play bills as a faithful black in connection with a little girl of noble birth and a monkey
and herbert_pocket had seen him as a predatory tartar of comic propensities with a face like a red brick and an outrageous hat all over bells
i dined at what herbert_pocket and i used to call a geographical chop house where there were maps of the world in porter pot rims on every half yard of the tablecloths and charts of gravy on every one of the knives to this day there is scarcely a single chop house within the lord mayor dominions which is not geographical and wore out the time in dozing over crumbs staring at gas and baking in a hot blast of dinner
both in going and returning i had seen the signal in his window all well by and by i roused myself and went to the play
there i found a virtuous boatswain in his majesty service a most excellent man though i could have wished his trousers not quite so tight in some place and not quite so loose in others who knocked all the little man hats over their eye though he was very generous and brave and who wouldnt hear of anybody paying taxes though he was very patriotic
he had a bag of money in his pocket like a pudding in the cloth and on that property married a young person in bed furniture with great rejoicings the whole population of portsmouth nine in number at the last census turning out on the beach to rub their own hand and shake everybody else and sing fill fill
a certain dark complexioned swab however who wouldnt fill or do anything else that was proposed to him and whose heart was openly stated by the boatswain to be as black as his figure head proposed to two other swabs to get all mankind into difficulties which was so effectually done the swab family having considerable political influence that it took half the evening to set thing right and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat black gaiters and red nose getting into a clock with a gridiron and listening and coming out and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he couldnt confute with what he had overheard
this led to mr_wopsle who had never been heard of before coming in with a star and garter on as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the admiralty to say that the swabs were all to go to prison on the spot and that he had brought the boatswain down the union jack as a slight acknowledgment of his public services
the boatswain unmanned for the first time respectfully dried his eye on the jack and then cheering up and addressing mr_wopsle as your honor solicited permission to take him by the fin
mr_wopsle conceding his fin with a gracious dignity was immediately shoved into a dusty corner while everybody danced a hornpipe and from that corner surveying the public with a discontented eye became aware of me
the second piece was the last new grand comic christmas pantomime in the first scene of which it pained me to suspect that i detected mr_wopsle with red worsted leg under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain fringe for his hair engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home very hoarse to dinner
but he presently presented himself under worthier circumstance for the genius of youthful love being in want of assistance on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughter heart by purposely falling upon the object in a flour sack out of the first floor window summoned a sententious enchanter and he coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily after an apparently violent journey proved to be mr_wopsle in a high crowned hat with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm
the business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at sung at butted at danced at and flashed at with fire of various colors he had a good deal of time on his hand
and i observed with great surprise that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement
there was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of mr_wopsle eye and he seemed to be turning so many thing over in his mind and to grow so confused that i could not make it out
i sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watch case and still i could not make it out
i was still thinking of it when i came out of the theatre an hour afterwards and found him waiting for me near the door
how do you do said i shaking hand with him as we turned down the street together i saw that you saw me
it is the strangest thing said mr_wopsle drifting into his lost look again and yet i could swear to him
saw you mr_pip he returned yes of course i saw you but who else was there who else
whether i should have noticed him at first but for your being there said mr_wopsle going on in the same lost way i cant be positive yet i think i should
involuntarily i looked round me as i was accustomed to look round me when i went home for these mysterious word gave me a chill
becoming alarmed i entreated mr_wopsle to explain his meaning oh he cant be in sight said mr_wopsle
he went out before i went off i saw him go having the reason that i had for being suspicious i even suspected this poor actor
i mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission therefore i glanced at him as we walked on together but said nothing
i had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you mr_pip till i saw that you were quite unconscious of him sitting behind you there like a ghost
my former chill crept over me again but i was resolved not to speak yet for it was quite consistent with his word that he might be set on to induce me to connect these references with mr_provis
of course i was perfectly sure and safe that mr_provis had not been there i dare say you wonder at me mr_pip indeed i see you do
but it is so very strange you ll hardly believe what i am going to tell you i could hardly believe it myself if you told me
mr_pip you remember in old time a certain christmas day when you were quite a child and i dined at mrs_joe_gargery and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended
and you remember that there was a chase after two convict and that we joined in it and that mrs_joe_gargery took you on his back and that i took the lead and you kept up with me as well as you could
indeed said i no indeed i remember it very well i remember it all very well better than he thought except the last clause
and you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch and that there was a scuffle between them and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other
and that the soldiers lighted torches and put the two in the centre and that we went on to see the last of them over the black marsh with the torchlight shining on their face i am particular about that with the torchlight shining on their face when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us
i see it all before me yes said i i remember all that then mr_pip one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight
i saw him over your shoulder steady i thought i asked him then which of the two do you suppose you saw
the one who had been mauled he answered readily and i ll swear i saw him the more i think of him the more certain i am of him
this is very curious said i with the best assumption i could put on of its being nothing more to me
i cannot exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me or the special and peculiar terror i felt at compeyson having been behind me like a ghost
for if he had ever been out of my thought for a few moment together since the hiding had begun it was in those very moment when he was closest to me and to think that i should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if i had shut an avenue of a hundred door to keep him out and then had found him at my elbow
i could not doubt either that he was there because i was there and that however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us danger was always near and active
very curious indeed i put such question to mr_wopsle as when did the man come in
it was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time
he could not tell me that he saw me and over my shoulder he saw the man how was he dressed
i believed not too for although in my brooding state i had taken no especial notice of the people behind me i thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention
when mr_wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or i extract and when i had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment after the fatigues of the evening we parted
prosperously but not noticeably otherwise he thought in black was his face at all disfigured no he believed not it was between twelve and one clock when i reached the temple and the gate were shut
no one was near me when i went in and went home herbert_pocket had come in and we held a very serious council by the fire
but there was nothing to be done saving to communicate to mr_wemmick what i had that night found out and to remind him that we waited for his hint
as i thought that i might compromise him if i went too often to the castle i made this communication by letter
i wrote it before i went to bed and went out and posted it and again no one was near me
herbert_pocket and i agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious and we were very cautious indeed more cautious than before if that were possible and
i for my part never went near chinks basin except when i rowed by and then i only looked at mill pond bank as i looked at anything else
chapter xlviii the second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first
i had again left my boat at the wharf below bridge the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon and undecided where to dine i had strolled up into cheapside and was strolling along it surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me
it was mr_jaggers hand and he passed it through my arm as we are going in the same direction mr_pip we may walk together
well i returned glad for once to get the better of him in cross examination i do not know for i have not made up my mind
where are you bound for for the temple i think said i dont you know said mr_jaggers you are going to dine said mr_jaggers
you dont mind admitting that i suppose no i returned i dont mind admitting that and are not engaged
i dont mind admitting also that i am not engaged then said mr_jaggers come and dine with me
i was going to excuse myself when he added mr_wemmick coming so i changed my excuse into an acceptance the few word i had uttered serving for the beginning of either and
we went along cheapside and slanted off to little britain while the light were springing up brilliantly in the shop window and the street lamp lighters scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon bustle were skipping up and down and running in and out opening more red eye in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the hummums had opened white eye in the ghostly wall
at the office in little britain there was the usual letter writing hand washing candle snuffing and safe locking that closed the business of the day
as i stood idle by mr_jaggers fire its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bo peep with me while the pair of coarse fat office candles that dimly lighted mr_jaggers as he wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty winding sheets as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients
we went to gerrard street all three together in a hackney coach and as soon as we got there dinner was served
although i should not have thought of making in that place the most distant reference by so much as a look to mr_wemmick walworth sentiments yet i should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way
he turned his eye on mr_jaggers whenever he raised them from the table and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin wemmicks and this was the wrong one
but it was not to be done did you send that note of miss_havisham to mr_pip mr_wemmick mr_jaggers asked soon after we began dinner
no sir returned mr_wemmick it was going by post when you brought mr_pip into the office here it is
it a note of two lines mr_pip said mr_jaggers handing it on sent up to me by miss_havisham on account of her not being sure of your address
he handed it to his principal instead of to me she tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her
you ll go down yes said i casting my eye over the note which was exactly in those terms when do you think of going down
i have an impending engagement said i glancing at mr_wemmick who was putting fish into the post office that renders me rather uncertain of my time
if mr_pip has the intention of going at once said mr_wemmick to mr_jaggers he neednt write an answer you know
receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay i settled that i would go to morrow and said so
at once i think mr_wemmick drank a glass of wine and looked with a grimly satisfied air at mr_jaggers but not at me
so mr_pip our friend the spider said mr_jaggers has played his cards he has won the pool it was as much as i could do to assent
hah he is a promising fellow in his way but he may not have it all his own way the stronger will win in the end but the stronger has to be found out first
surely i interrupted with a burning face and heart you do not seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that mr_jaggers
if he should turn to and beat her he may possibly get the strength on his side if it should be a question of intellect he certainly will not
it would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstance because it a toss up between two results
if he should turn to and beat her i didnt say so mr_pip i am putting a case may i ask what they are
a fellow like our friend the spider answered mr_jaggers either beats or cringes he may cringe and growl or cringe and not growl but he either beats or cringes
so here to mrs mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle said mr_jaggers taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumb waiter and filling for each of us and for himself and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady satisfaction
ask mr_wemmick his opinion either beats or cringes said mr_wemmick not at all addressing himself to me to the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman it never will be
now molly molly molly molly how slow you are to day she was at his elbow when he addressed her putting a dish upon the table
as she withdrew her hand from it she fell back a step or two nervously muttering some excuse and a certain action of her finger as she spoke arrested my attention
what the matter said mr_jaggers nothing only the subject we were speaking of said i was rather painful to me
she stood looking at her master not understanding whether she was free to go or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go
the action of her finger was like the action of knitting her look was very intent surely i had seen exactly such eye and such hand on a memorable occasion very lately
he dismissed her and she glided out of the room but she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there
i looked at those hand i looked at those eye i looked at that flowing hair and i compared them with other hand other eye other hair that i knew of and with what those might be after twenty year of a brutal husband and a stormy life
i looked again at those hand and eye of the housekeeper and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when i last walked not alone in the ruined garden and through the deserted brewery
i thought how the same feeling had come back when i saw a face looking at me and a hand waving to me from a stage coach window and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning when i had passed in a carriage not alone through a sudden glare of light in a dark street
i thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre and how such a link wanting before had been riveted for me now when i had passed by a chance swift from miss_estella name to the finger with their knitting action and the attentive eye
mr_jaggers had seen me with miss_estella and was not likely to have missed the sentiments i had been at no pains to conceal
he nodded when i said the subject was painful to me clapped me on the back put round the wine again and went on with his dinner
only twice more did the housekeeper reappear and then her stay in the room was very short and mr_jaggers was sharp with her
but her hand were miss_estella hand and her eye were miss_estella eye and if she had reappeared a hundred time i could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth
it was a dull evening for mr_wemmick drew his wine when it came round quite as a matter of business just as he might have drawn his salary when that came round and with his eye on his chief sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross examination
as to the quantity of wine his post office was as indifferent and ready as any other post office for its quantity of letters
from my point of view he was the wrong twin all the time and only externally like the mr_wemmick of walworth
even when we were groping among mr_jaggers stock of boots for our hats i felt that the right twin was on his way back and we had not gone half a dozen yards down gerrard street in the walworth direction before i found that i was walking arm in arm with the right twin and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air
and i felt absolutely certain that this woman was miss_estella mother we took our leave early and left together well said mr_wemmick that over
he a wonderful man without his living likeness but i feel that i have to screw myself up when i dine with
him and i dine more comfortably unscrewed i felt that this was a good statement of the case and told him so
wouldnt say it to anybody but yourself he answered i know that what is said between you and me goes no further
i asked him if he had ever seen miss_havisham adopted daughter mrs mrs_bentley_drummle mr_drummle he said no to avoid being too abrupt i then spoke of the aged and of miss_skiffins
he looked rather sly when i mentioned miss_skiffins and stopped in the street to blow his nose with a roll of the head and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness
mr_wemmick said i do you remember telling me before i first went to mr_jaggers private house to notice that housekeeper
did i he replied ah i dare say i did deuce take me he added suddenly i know i did
i find i am not quite unscrewed yet a wild beast tamed you called her and what do you call her
the same how did mr_jaggers tame her mr_wemmick that his secret she has been with him many a long year
i wish you would tell me her story i feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it you know that what is said between you and me goes no further
well mr_wemmick replied i dont know her story that is i dont know all of it but what i do know i ll tell you
we are in our private and personal capacities of course of course a score or so of year ago that woman was tried at the old bailey for murder and was acquitted
she was a very handsome young woman and i believe had some gypsy blood in her anyhow it was hot enough when it was up as you may suppose
mr_jaggers was for her pursued mr_wemmick with a look full of meaning and worked the case in a way quite astonishing
it was a desperate case and it was comparatively early day with him then and he worked it to general admiration in fact it may almost be said to have made him
he worked it himself at the police office day after day for many day contending against even a committal and at the trial where he couldnt work it himself sat under counsel and every one knew put in all the salt and pepper
but she was acquitted the murdered person was a woman a woman a good ten year older very much larger and very much stronger
they both led tramping life and this woman in gerrard street here had been married very young over the broomstick as we say to a tramping man and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy
the murdered woman more a match for the man certainly in point of year was found dead in a barn near hounslow heath
it was a case of jealousy there had been a violent struggle perhaps a fight she was bruised and scratched and torn and had been held by the throat at last and choked
now there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it mr_jaggers principally rested his case
you may be sure said mr_wemmick touching me on the sleeve that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hand then though he sometimes does now
i had told mr_wemmick of his showing us her wrists that day of the dinner party well sir mr_wemmick went on it happened happened dont you see that
this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension that she looked much slighter than she really was in particular her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her arm had quite a delicate look
she had only a bruise or two about her nothing for a tramp but the back of her hand were lacerated and the question was
now mr_jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face but which she could not have got through and kept her hand out of and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there
but the boldest point he made was this it was attempted to be set up in proof of her jealousy that she was under strong suspicion of having at about the time of the murder frantically destroyed her child by this man some three year old to revenge herself upon him
mr_jaggers worked that in this way we say these are not marks of finger nails but marks of brambles and we show you the brambles
was it with finger nails you say they are marks of finger nails and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child
for anything we know she may have destroyed her child and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hand
you must accept all consequences of that hypothesis what then you are not trying her for the murder of her child why dont you
as to this case if you will have scratches we say that for anything we know you may have accounted for them assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them
to sum up sir said mr_wemmick mr_jaggers was altogether too many for the jury and they gave in has she been in his service ever since
yes but not only that said mr_wemmick she went into his service immediately after her acquittal tamed as she is now
she has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties but she was tamed from the beginning
do you remember the sex of the child said to have been a girl you have nothing more to say to me to night
we exchanged a cordial good night and i went home with new matter for my thought though with no relief from the old
putting miss_havisham note in my pocket that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at satis house in case her waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me i went down again by the coach next day
but i alighted at the halfway house and breakfasted there and walked the rest of the distance for i sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented way and to leave it in the same manner
nothing i got your letter and destroyed it nothing chapter xlix the best light of the day was gone when i passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the high street
the nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had their refectories and gardens and where the strong wall were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves
the cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me as i hurried on avoiding observation than they had ever had before so the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music and the rooks as they hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden seemed to call to me that the place was changed and that miss_estella was gone out of it for ever
an elderly woman whom i had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard opened the gate
the lighted candle stood in the dark passage within as of old and i took it up and ascended the staircase alone
looking in at the door after knocking in vain i saw her sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair close before and lost in the contemplation of the ashy fire
doing as i had often done i went in and stood touching the old chimney piece where she could see me when she raised her eye
there was an air of utter loneliness upon her that would have moved me to pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than i could charge her with
as i stood compassionating her and thinking how in the progress of time i too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house her eye rested on me
miss_havisham was not in her own room but was in the larger room across the landing she stared and said in a low voice is it real
it is i mr_pip mr_jaggers gave me your note yesterday and i have lost no time thank you thank you
as i brought another of the ragged chair to the hearth and sat down i remarked a new expression on her face as if she were afraid of me
i want she said to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here and to show you that i am not all stone
when i said some reassuring word she stretched out her tremulous right hand as though she was going to touch me but she recalled it again before i understood the action or knew how to receive it
but perhaps you can never believe now that there is anything human in my heart you said speaking for your friend that you could tell me how to do something useful and good
something that you would like done is it not something that i would like done very much what is it
i had not got far into it when i judged from her look that she was thinking in a discursive way of me rather than of what i said
it seemed to be so for when i stopped speaking many moment passed before she showed that she was conscious of the fact
do you break off she asked then with her former air of being afraid of me because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me
i began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership no no i answered how can you think so miss_havisham
i stopped because i thought you were not following what i said perhaps i was not she answered putting a hand to her head
she set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend
i went on with my explanation and told her how i had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means but how in this i was disappointed
that part of the subject i reminded her involved matters which could form no part of my explanation for they were the weighty secrets of another
begin again and let me look at something else stay now tell me so said she assenting with her head but not looking at me
and how much money is wanting to complete the purchase i was rather afraid of stating it for it sounded a large sum
nine hundred pounds if i give you the money for this purpose will you keep my secret as you have kept your own
quite as faithfully and your mind will be more at rest much more at rest are you very unhappy now
she asked this question still without looking at me but in an unwonted tone of sympathy i could not reply at the moment for my voice failed me
she put her left arm across the head of her stick and softly laid her forehead on it i am far from happy miss_havisham but i have other causes of disquiet than any you know of
they are the secrets i have mentioned after a little while she raised her head and looked at the fire again
it is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness is it true too true
can i only serve you mr_pip by serving your friend regarding that as done is there nothing i can do for you yourself
nothing i thank you for the question i thank you even more for the tone of the question but there is nothing
there were none there and she took from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets mounted in tarnished gold and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from her neck
she presently rose from her seat and looked about the blighted room for the means of writing you are still on friendly terms with mr_jaggers
this is an authority to him to pay you that money to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend
i keep no money here but if you would rather mr_jaggers knew nothing of the matter i will send it to you
quite i dined with him yesterday thank you miss_havisham i have not the least objection to receiving it from him
she read me what she had written and it was direct and clear and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money
i took the tablets from her hand and it trembled again and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached and put it in mine
if you can ever write under my name i forgive her though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it
all this she did without looking at me my name is on the first leaf miss_havisham said i i can do it now
there have been sore mistakes and my life has been a blind and thankless one and i want forgiveness and direction far too much to be bitter with you
she turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it and to my amazement i may even add to my terror dropped on her knees at my foot with her folded hand raised to me in the manner in which when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole they must often have been raised to heaven from her mother side
to see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my foot gave me a shock through all my frame
i entreated her to rise and got my arm about her to help her up but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp and hung her head over it and wept
i had never seen her shed a tear before and in the hope that the relief might do her good i bent over her without speaking
she was not kneeling now but was down upon the ground she cried despairingly what have i done
what have i done if you mean miss_havisham what have you done to injure me let me answer very little
i should have loved her under any circumstance is she married yes it was a needless question for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so
what have i done what have i done she wrung her hand and crushed her white hair and returned to this cry over and over again
that she had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her wild resentment spurned affection and wounded pride found vengeance in i knew full well
but that in shutting out the light of day she had shut out infinitely more that in seclusion she had secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences that her mind brooding solitary had grown diseased as all mind do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their maker i knew equally well
and could i look upon her without compassion seeing her punishment in the ruin she was in her profound unfitness for this earth on which she was placed in the vanity of sorrow which had become a master mania like the vanity of penitence the vanity of remorse the vanity of unworthiness and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world
until you spoke to her the other day and until i saw in you a looking glass that showed me what i once felt myself i did not know what i had done
what have i done i knew not how to answer or how to comfort her what have i done
what have i done and so again twenty fifty time over what had she done miss_havisham i said when her cry had died away you may dismiss me from your mind and conscience
but miss_estella is a different case and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of her right nature away from her it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred year
yes yes i know it but mr_pip my dear there was an earnest womanly compassion for me in her new affection
my dear believe this when she first came to me i meant to save her from misery like my own
but as she grew and promised to be very beautiful i gradually did worse and with my praises and with my jewels and with my teachings and with this figure of myself always before her a warning to back and point my lessons i stole her heart away and put ice in its place
at first i meant no more well well said i i hope so better i could not help saying to have left her a natural heart even to be bruised or broken
with that miss_havisham looked distractedly at me for a while and then burst out again what had she done
if you knew all my story she pleaded you would have some compassion for me and a better understanding of me
miss_havisham i answered as delicately as i could i believe i may say that i do know your story and have known it ever since i first left this neighborhood
it has inspired me with great commiseration and i hope i understand it and its influences does what has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to miss_estella
not as she is but as she was when she first came here she was seated on the ground with her arm on the ragged chair and her head leaning on them
she looked full at me when i said this and replied go on whose child was miss_estella she shook her head
you dont know she shook her head again but mr_jaggers brought her here or sent her here
she answered in a low whisper and with caution i had been shut up in these room a long time i dont know how long
you know what time the clocks keep here when i told him that i wanted a little girl to rear and love and save from my fate
i had first seen him when i sent for him to lay this place waste for me having read of him in the newspapers before i and the world parted
brought her here will you tell me how that came about he told me that he would look about him for such an orphan child
one night he brought her here asleep and i called her miss_estella might i ask her age then two or three
so convinced i was of that woman being her mother that i wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind
she herself knows nothing but that she was left an orphan and i adopted her but to any mind i thought the connection here was clear and straight
what more could i hope to do by prolonging the interview i had succeeded on behalf of herbert_pocket miss_havisham had told me all she knew of miss_estella i had said and done what i could to ease her mind
no matter with what other word we parted we parted twilight was closing in when i went downstairs into the natural air
i called to the woman who had opened the gate when i entered that i would not trouble her just yet but would walk round the place before leaving
for i had a presentiment that i should never be there again and i felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it
by the wilderness of casks that i had walked on long ago and on which the rain of year had fallen since rotting them in many place and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end i made my way to the ruined garden
i went all round it round by the corner where herbert_pocket and i had fought our battle round by the paths where miss_estella and i had walked
taking the brewery on my way back i raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it and walked through
i was going out at the opposite door not easy to open now for the damp wood had started and swelled and the hinges were yielding and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of fungus when
a childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action and i fancied that i saw miss_havisham hanging to the beam
so strong was the impression that i stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before i knew it was a fancy though to be sure i was there in an instant
the mournfulness of the place and time and the great terror of this illusion though it was but momentary caused me to feel an indescribable awe as i came out between the open wooden gate where i had once wrung my hair after miss_estella had wrung my heart
passing on into the front courtyard i hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out at the locked gate of which she had the key or first to go upstairs and assure myself that miss_havisham was as safe and well as i had left her
so cold so lonely so dreary all i turned my head to look back i took the latter course and went up
i looked into the room where i had left her and i saw her seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire with her back towards me
in the moment when i was withdrawing my head to go quietly away i saw a great flaming light spring up
in the same moment i saw her running at me shrieking with a whirl of fire blazing all about her and soaring at least as many foot above her head as she was high
i had a double caped great coat on and over my arm another thick coat that i got them off closed with her threw her down and got them over her
that i dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst and all the ugly thing that sheltered there that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies and that the closer i covered her the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself that
i knew nothing until i knew that we were on the floor by the great table and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air which a moment ago had been her faded bridal dress
then i looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door
i still held her forcibly down with all my strength like a prisoner who might escape and i doubt if i even knew who she was or why we had struggled or that she had been in flames or that the flames were out until i saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us
this occurred i knew through the result but not through anything i felt or thought or knew i did she was insensible and i was afraid to have her moved or even touched
assistance was sent for and i held her until it came as if i unreasonably fancied i think i did that if i let her go the fire would break out again and consume her
when i got up on the surgeon coming to her with other aid i was astonished to see that both my hand were burnt for i had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling
on examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts but that they of themselves were far from hopeless the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock
by the surgeon directions her bed was carried into that room and laid upon the great table which happened to be well suited to the dressing of her injuries
when i saw her again an hour afterwards she lay indeed where i had seen her strike her stick and had heard her say that she would lie one day
though every vestige of her dress was burnt as they told me she still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance for they had covered her to the throat with white cotton wool and as she lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her
i found on questioning the servants that miss_estella was in paris and i got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next post
i took upon myself intending to communicate with mr_matthew_pocket only and leave him to do as he liked about informing the rest
miss_havisham family this i did next day through herbert_pocket as soon as i returned to town there was a stage that evening when she spoke collectedly of what had happened though with a certain terrible vivacity
towards midnight she began to wander in her speech and after that it gradually set in that she said innumerable time in a low solemn voice
what have i done and then when she first came i meant to save her from misery like mine
she never changed the order of these three sentences but she sometimes left out a word in one or other of them never putting in another word but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word
as i could do no service there and as i had nearer home that pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive out of my mind i decided in the course of the night that i would return by the early morning coach walking on a mile or so and being taken up clear of the town
at about six clock of the morning therefore i leaned over her and touched her lips with mine just as they said not stopping for being touched take the pencil and write under my name i forgive her
and then take the pencil and write under my name i forgive her chapter my hand had been dressed twice or thrice in the night and again in the morning
my left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow and less severely as high as the shoulder it was very painful but the flames had set in that direction and i felt thankful it was no worse
it was bandaged of course but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm those i carried in a sling and i could only wear my coat like a cloak loose over my shoulder and fastened at the neck
my right hand was not so badly burnt but that i could move the finger my hair had been caught by the fire but not my head or face
when herbert_pocket had been down to hammersmith and seen his father he came back to me at our chambers and devoted the day to attending on me
he was the kindest of nurses and at stated time took off the bandages and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready and put them on again with a patient tenderness that i was deeply grateful for
at first as i lay quiet on the sofa i found it painfully difficult i might say impossible to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames their hurry and noise and the fierce burning smell
if i dozed for a minute i was awakened by miss_havisham cries and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head
this pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain i suffered and herbert_pocket seeing that did his utmost to hold my attention engaged
that was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject and by our agreeing without agreement to make my recovery of the use of my hand a question of so many hour not of so many weeks
neither of us spoke of the boat but we both thought of it my first question when i saw herbert_pocket had been of course whether all was well down the river
as he replied in the affirmative with perfect confidence and cheerfulness we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away
but then as herbert_pocket changed the bandages more by the light of the fire than by the outer light he went back to it spontaneously
i sat with mr_provis last night handel two good hour where was clara dear little thing said herbert_pocket
she was up and down with gruffandgrim all the evening he was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment she left his sight
i doubt if he can hold out long though what with rum and pepper and pepper and rum i should think his pegging must be nearly over
how can i take care of the dear child otherwise lay your arm out upon the back of the sofa my dear boy and i ll sit down here and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes
and then you will be married herbert_pocket i was speaking of mr_provis do you know handel he improves i said to you
i thought he was softened when i last saw him so you did and so he is he was very communicative last night and told me more of his life
you remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble with did i hurt you i had started but not under his touch
his word had given me a start i had forgotten that herbert_pocket but i remember it now you speak of it
well he went into that part of his life and a dark wild part it is shall i tell you
herbert_pocket bent forward to look at me more nearly as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for
or would it worry you just now tell me by all means every word your head is cool he said touching it
it seems said herbert_pocket there a bandage off most charmingly and now comes the cool one makes you shrink at first my poor dear fellow dont it
seems that the woman was a young woman and a jealous woman and a revengeful woman revengeful handel to the last degree
quite said i tell me what mr_provis said my dear herbert_pocket but it will be comfortable presently it
to what last degree murder does it strike too cold on that sensitive place i dont feel it how did she murder
why the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name said herbert_pocket but she was tried for it and mr_jaggers defended her and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to mr_provis
whom did she murder it was another and a stronger woman who was the victim and there had been a struggle in a barn
who began it or how fair it was or how unfair may be doubtful but how it ended is certainly not doubtful for the victim was found throttled
was the woman brought in guilty no she was acquitted my poor handel i hurt you it is impossible to be gentler herbert_pocket
yes what else this acquitted young woman and mr_provis had a little child a little child of whom mr_provis was exceedingly fond
on the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as i tell you the young woman presented herself before mr_provis for one moment and swore that she would destroy the child which was in her possession and he should never see it again then she vanished there the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more and now there remains but
i can do it better by this light than by a stronger for my hand is steadiest when i dont see the poor blistered patches too distinctly you dont think your breathing is affected my dear boy
the right hand which is a far easier job you seem to breathe quickly perhaps i do herbert_pocket did the woman keep her oath
why of course my dear boy returned herbert_pocket in a tone of surprise and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me
there comes the darkest part of mr_provis life she did that is he says she did he says it all
now whether pursued herbert_pocket he had used the child mother ill or whether he had used the child mother well mr_provis doesnt say but she had shared some four or five year of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside and he seems to have felt pity for her and forbearance towards her
therefore fearing he should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child and so be the cause of her death he hid himself much as he grieved for the child kept himself dark as he says out of the way and out of the trial and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called abel_magwitch out of whom the jealousy arose
i have no other information no to be sure after the acquittal she disappeared and thus he lost the child and the child mother
that evil genius compeyson the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time and of his reason for doing so of course afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him poorer and working him harder
i want to ask a moment my dear boy and i have done it was clear last night that this barbed the point of mr_provis animosity
i want to know said i and particularly herbert_pocket whether he told you when this happened particularly let me remember then what he said as to that
his expression was a round score year ago and a most directly after i took up wi compeyson how old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard
it had happened some three or four year then he said and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost who would have been about your age
herbert_pocket said i after a short silence in a hurried way can you see me best by the light of the window or the light of the fire
i think in my seventh year ay by the firelight answered herbert_pocket coming close again look at me i do look at you my dear boy
you are not afraid that i am in any fever or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night
touch me i do touch you my dear boy no my dear boy said herbert_pocket after taking time to examine me
you are rather excited but you are quite yourself i know i am quite myself and the man we have in hiding down the river is miss_estella father
chapter li what purpose i had in view when i was hot on tracing out and proving miss_estella parentage i cannot say
it will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own
but when herbert_pocket and i had held our momentous conversation i was seized with a feverish conviction that i ought to hunt the matter
i ought not to let it rest but that i ought to see mr_jaggers and come at the bare truth
i really do not know whether i felt that i did this for miss_estella sake or whether i was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation i was so much concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me
down that perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth any way i could scarcely be withheld from going out to gerrard street that night
herbert_pocket representations that if i did i should probably be laid up and stricken useless when our fugitive safety would depend upon me alone restrained my impatience
on the understanding again and again reiterated that come what would i was to go to mr_jaggers to morrow i at length submitted to keep quiet and to have my hurts looked after and to stay at home
early next morning we went out together and at the corner of giltspur street by smithfield i left herbert_pocket to go his way into the city and took my way to little britain
there were periodical occasion when mr_jaggers and mr_wemmick went over the office accounts and checked off the vouchers and put all thing straight
on these occasion mr_wemmick took his book and papers into mr_jaggers room and one of the upstairs clerks came down into the outer office
finding such clerk on mr_wemmick post that morning i knew what was going on but i was not sorry to have mr_jaggers and mr_wemmick together as mr_wemmick would then hear for himself that i said nothing to compromise him
although i had sent mr_jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as i had arrived in town yet i had to give him all the details now and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence than it had been before
my appearance with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulder favored my object while i described the disaster mr_jaggers stood according to his wont before the fire
mr_wemmick leaned back in his chair staring at me with his hand in the pocket of his trousers and his pen put horizontally into the post
the two brutal casts always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings seemed to be congestively considering whether they didnt smell fire at the present moment
my narrative finished and their question exhausted i then produced miss_havisham authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for herbert_pocket
mr_jaggers eye retired a little deeper into his head when i handed him the tablets but he presently handed them over to mr_wemmick with instructions to draw the check for his signature
while that was in course of being done i looked on at mr_wemmick as he wrote and mr_jaggers poising and swaying himself on his well polished boots looked on at me
i am sorry mr_pip said he as i put the check in my pocket when he had signed it that we do nothing for you
miss_havisham was good enough to ask me i returned whether she could do nothing for me and i told her no
everybody should know his own business said mr_jaggers and i saw mr_wemmick lips form the word portable property
i should not have told her no if i had been you said mr_jaggers but every man ought to know his own business best
as i thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme i had at heart i said turning on mr_jaggers
every man business said mr_wemmick rather reproachfully towards me is portable property i did ask something of miss_havisham however sir
i asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter and she gave me all she possessed did she said mr_jaggers bending forward to look at his boots and then straightening himself
hah i dont think i should have done so if i had been miss_havisham but she ought to know her own business best
i know more of the history of miss_havisham adopted child than miss_havisham herself does sir i know her mother
mr_jaggers looked at me inquiringly and repeated mother i have seen her mother within these three day yes said mr_jaggers
and so have you sir and you have seen her still more recently yes said mr_jaggers perhaps i know more of miss_estella history than even you do said i_
a certain stop that mr_jaggers came to in his manner he was too self possessed to change his manner but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stop assured me that he did not know who her father was
this i had strongly suspected from mr_provis account as herbert_pocket had repeated it of his having kept himself dark which i pieced on to the fact that he himself was not mr_jaggers client until some four year later and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity
but i could not be sure of this unconsciousness on mr_jaggers part before though i was quite sure of it now
i know her father too so you know the young lady father mr_pip said mr_jaggers yes i replied and his name is mr_provis from new south wales
it was the slightest start that could escape a man the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked but he did start though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pocket handkerchief
how mr_wemmick received the announcement i am unable to say for i was afraid to look at him just then lest mr_jaggers sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us
and on what evidence mr_pip asked mr_jaggers very coolly as he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose does mr_provis make this claim
he does not make it said i and has never made it and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence
my reply was so unexpected that mr_jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing the usual performance folded his arm and looked with stern attention at me though with an immovable face
then i told him all i knew and how i knew it with the one reservation that i left him to infer that i knew from miss_havisham what i in fact knew from mr_wemmick
even mr_jaggers started when i said those word for once the powerful pocket handkerchief failed i was very careful indeed as to that
nor did i look towards mr_wemmick until i had finished all i had to tell and had been for some time silently meeting mr_jaggers look
when i did at last turn my eye in mr_wemmick direction i found that he had unposted his pen and was intent upon the table before him
hah said mr_jaggers at last as he moved towards the papers on the table what item was it you were at
but i could not submit to be thrown off in that way and i made a passionate almost an indignant appeal to him to be more frank and manly with me
i reminded him of the false hopes into which i had lapsed the length of time they had lasted and the discovery i had made and i hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits
i represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him in return for the confidence i had just now imparted
i said that i did not blame him or suspect him or mistrust him but i wanted assurance of the truth from him
and if he asked me why i wanted it and why i thought i had any right to it i would tell him little as he cared for such poor dreams that i had loved miss_estella dearly and long and that although i had lost her and must live a bereaved life whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world
and seeing that mr_jaggers stood quite still and silent and apparently quite obdurate under this appeal i turned to mr_wemmick and said mr_wemmick i know you to be a man with a gentle heart
i have seen your pleasant home and your old father and all the innocent cheerful playful way with which you refresh your business life
and i entreat you to say a word for me to mr_jaggers and to represent to him that all circumstance considered he ought to be more open with me
i have never seen two man look more oddly at one another than mr_jaggers and mr_wemmick did after this apostrophe
at first a misgiving crossed me that mr_wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment but it melted as i saw mr_jaggers relax into something like a smile and mr_wemmick become bolder
mr_wemmick when mr_pip came in what all this said mr_jaggers you with an old father and you with pleasant and playful way
mr_pip said mr_jaggers laying his hand upon my arm and smiling openly this man must be the most cunning impostor in all london
well returned mr_wemmick if i dont bring em here what does it matter not a bit of it returned mr_wemmick growing bolder and bolder
i think you re another again they exchanged their former odd look each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him in
you with a pleasant home said mr_jaggers since it dont interfere with business returned mr_wemmick let it be so
now i look at you sir i shouldnt wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these day when you re tired of all this work
mr_pip said he we wont talk about poor dreams you know more about such thing than i having much fresher experience of that kind
mr_jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three time and actually drew a sigh but now about this other matter
i ll put a case to you mind i admit nothing he waited for me to declare that i quite understood that he expressly said that he admitted nothing
put the case that a woman under such circumstance as you have mentioned held her child concealed and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser on his representing to her that he must know with an eye to the latitude of his defence how the fact stood about that child
put the case that at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up
put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil and that all he saw of child was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction
put the case that he often saw child solemnly tried at a criminal bar where they were held up to be seen put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned whipped transported neglected cast out qualified in all way for the hangman and growing up to be hanged
put the case that pretty nigh all the child he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn to develop into the fish that were to come to his net to be prosecuted defended forsworn made orphans bedevilled somehow
put the case mr_pip that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved whom the father believed dead and dared make no stir about as to whom over the mother the legal adviser had this power i know what you did and how you did it
now mr_pip said mr_jaggers put this case i follow you sir i follow you sir you came so and so you did such and such thing to divert suspicion
part with the child unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you and then it shall be produced
i have tracked you through it all and i tell it you all give the child into my hand and i will do my best to bring you off
if you are saved your child is saved too if you are lost your child is still saved put the case that this was done and that the woman was cleared
i understand you perfectly but that i make no admissions that you make no admissions and mr_wemmick repeated no admissions
put the case mr_pip that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the woman intellects and that when she was set at liberty she was scared out of the way of the world and went to him to be sheltered
put the case that he took her in and that he kept down the old wild violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out by asserting his power over her in the old way
do you comprehend the imaginary case quite put the case that the child grew up and was married for money
that the mother and father unknown to one another were dwelling within so many miles furlongs yards if you like of one another
that the mother was still living that the father was still living that the secret was still a secret except that you had got wind of it
put that last case to yourself very carefully i do i ask mr_wemmick to put it to himself very carefully
and mr_wemmick said i do for whose sake would you reveal the secret for the father i think he would not be much the better for the mother
for the mother i think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was for the daughter
i think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband and to drag her back to disgrace after an escape of twenty year pretty secure to last for life
but add the case that you had loved her mr_pip and had made her the subject of those poor dreams which have at one time or another been in the head of more man than you think likely then i tell you that you had better and would much sooner when you had thought well of it chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand and then pass the chopper on to mr_wemmick there to cut that off too
i looked at mr_wemmick whose face was very grave he gravely touched his lips with his forefinger i did the same
now mr_wemmick said the latter then resuming his usual manner what item was it you were at when mr_pip came in
standing by for a little while they were at work i observed that the odd look they had cast at one another were repeated several time with this difference now that each of them seemed suspicious not to say conscious of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other
for this reason i suppose they were now inflexible with one another mr_jaggers being highly dictatorial and mr_wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment
mr_jaggers did the same i had never seen them on such ill terms for generally they got on very well indeed together
but they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of mike the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his sleeve whom i had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those wall
this individual who either in his own person or in that of some member of his family seemed to be always in trouble which in that place meant newgate called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting
as he imparted this melancholy circumstance to mr_wemmick mr_jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings mike eye happened to twinkle with a tear
what are you about demanded mr_wemmick with the utmost indignation what do you come snivelling here for i didnt go to do it mr_wemmick
you did said mr_wemmick how dare you you re not in a fit state to come here if you cant come here without spluttering like a bad pen
what do you mean by it a man cant help his feelings mr_wemmick pleaded mike his what demanded mr_wemmick quite savagely
say that again now look here my man said mr_jaggers advancing a step and pointing to the door get out of this office
so the unfortunate mike very humbly withdrew and mr_jaggers and mr_wemmick appeared to have re established their good understanding and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch
i ll have no feelings here get out it serves you right said mr_wemmick get out chapter lii from little britain
i went with my check in my pocket to miss_skiffins brother the accountant and miss_skiffins brother the accountant going straight to clarriker and bringing clarriker to me i had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement
it was the only good thing i had done and the only completed thing i had done since i was first apprised of my great expectations
clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the house were steadily progressing that he would now be able to establish a small branch house in the east which was much wanted for the extension of the business and that herbert_pocket in his new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it i found that i must have prepared for a separation from my friend even though my own affairs had been more settled
and now indeed i felt as if my last anchor were loosening its hold and i should soon be driving with the winds and waves
but there was recompense in the joy with which herbert_pocket would come home of a night and tell me of these changes
little imagining that he told me no news and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting clara barley to the land of the arabian night and of me going out to join them with a caravan of camels i believe and of our all going up the nile and seeing wonders
without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans i felt that herbert_pocket way was clearing fast and that old bill_barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum and his daughter would soon be happily provided for
my left arm though it presented no bad symptoms took in the natural course so long to heal that i was still unable to get a coat on
on a monday morning when herbert_pocket and i were at breakfast i received the following letter from mr_wemmick by the post
we had now got into the month of march my right arm was tolerably restored disfigured but fairly serviceable walworth
early in the week or say wednesday you might do what you know of if you felt disposed to try it
when i had shown this to herbert_pocket and had put it in the fire but not before we had both got it by heart we considered what to do
burn this as soon as read now burn for of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view
i have thought it over again and again said herbert_pocket and i think i know a better course than taking a thames waterman
take startop a good fellow a skilled hand fond of us and enthusiastic and honorable i had thought of him more than once
let him suppose it a mere freak but a secret one until the morning comes then let him know that there is urgent reason for your getting mr_provis aboard and away
but how much would you tell him herbert_pocket it is necessary to tell him very little you go with him
it had seemed to me in the many anxious considerations i had given the point almost indifferent what port we made for hamburg
no doubt where rotterdam antwerp the place signified little so that he was out of england any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do
i had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the boat certainly well beyond gravesend which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot
as foreign steamers would leave london at about the time of high water our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb tide and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one
the time when one would be due where we lay wherever that might be could be calculated pretty nearly if we made inquiries beforehand
we found that a steamer for hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best and we directed our thought chiefly to that vessel
but we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave london with the same tide and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and color of each
we then separated for a few hour i to get at once such passports as were necessary herbert_pocket to see startop at his lodgings
we both did what we had to do without any hindrance and when we met again at one clock reported it done
herbert_pocket assented to all this and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations i for my part was prepared with passports herbert_pocket had seen startop and he was more than ready to join
those two should pull a pair of oars we settled and i would steer our charge would be sitter and keep quiet as speed was not our object we should make way enough
we arranged that herbert_pocket should not come home to dinner before going to mill pond bank that evening that he should not go there at all to morrow evening tuesday that he should prepare mr_provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house on wednesday when he saw us approach and not sooner that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that monday night and that he should be communicated with no more in any way until we took him on board
on opening the outer door of our chambers with my key i found a letter in the box directed to me a very dirty letter though not ill written
these precautions well understood by both of us i went home it had been delivered by hand of course since i left home and its contents were these
if you are not afraid to come to the old marsh to night or to morrow night at nine and to come to the little sluice house by the limekiln you had better come
if you want information regarding your uncle mr_provis you had much better come and tell no one and lose no time
you must come alone bring this with you i had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter
and the worst was that i must decide quickly or i should miss the afternoon coach which would take me down in time for to night
what to do now i could not tell to morrow night i could not think of going for it would be too close upon the time of the flight
and again for anything i knew the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself if i had had ample time for consideration i believe i should still have gone
having hardly any time for consideration my watch showing me that the coach started within half an hour i resolved to go i should certainly not have gone but for the reference to my uncle mr_provis
it is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter in a violent hurry that i had to read this mysterious epistle again twice before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind
yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way i left a note in pencil for herbert_pocket telling him that as i should be so soon going away i knew not for how long i had decided to hurry down and back to ascertain for myself how miss_havisham was faring
i had then barely time to get my great coat lock up the chambers and make for the coach office by the short by way
if i had taken a hackney chariot and gone by the streets i should have missed my aim going as i did i caught the coach just as it came out of the yard
that coming on mr_wemmick letter and the morning busy preparation turned the scale i was the only inside passenger jolting away knee deep in straw when i came to myself
for i really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter it had so bewildered me ensuing on the hurry of the morning
the morning hurry and flutter had been great for long and anxiously as i had waited for mr_wemmick his hint had come like a surprise at last
and now i began to wonder at myself for being in the coach and to doubt whether i had sufficient reason for being there and to consider whether i should get out presently and go back and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication and in short to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which i suppose very few hurried people are strangers
i reasoned as i had reasoned already without knowing it if that be reasoning in case any harm should befall him through my not going how could i ever forgive myself
it was dark before we got down and the journey seemed long and dreary to me who could see little of it inside and who could not go outside in my disabled state
still the reference to mr_provis by name mastered everything avoiding the blue_boar i put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town and ordered some dinner
while it was preparing i went to satis house and inquired for miss_havisham she was still very ill though considered something better
my inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house and i dined in a little octagonal common room like a font
as i was not able to cut my dinner the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me
this bringing us into conversation he was so good as to entertain me with my own story of course with the popular feature that mr_pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes
do you know the young man said i know him repeated the landlord ever since he was no height at all
ay he comes back said the landlord to his great friend now and again and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him
does he ever come back to this neighborhood what man is that him that i speak of said the landlord
mr_pumblechook is he ungrateful to no one else no doubt he would be if he could returned the landlord but he cant
and why because mr_pumblechook done everything for him does mr_pumblechook say so say so replied the landlord he hant no call to say so
but does he say so it would turn a man blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it sir said the landlord
i thought yet mrs_joe_gargery dear mrs_joe_gargery you never tell of it long suffering and loving mrs_joe_gargery you never complain nor you sweet tempered biddy
your appetite been touched like by your accident said the landlord glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat try a tenderer bit
no thank you i replied turning from the table to brood over the fire i can eat no more
please take it away i had never been struck at so keenly for my thanklessness to mrs_joe_gargery as through the brazen impostor mr_pumblechook
the falser he the truer mrs_joe_gargery the meaner he the nobler mrs_joe_gargery my heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as i mused over the fire for an hour or more
the striking of the clock aroused me but not from my dejection or remorse and i got up and had my coat fastened round my neck and went out
i had previously sought in my pocket for the letter that i might refer to it again but i could not find it and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach
i knew very well however that the appointed place was the little sluice house by the limekiln on the marsh and the hour nine
it was a dark night though the full moon rose as i left the enclosed lands and passed out upon the marsh
towards the marsh i now went straight having no time to spare chapter liii beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon
in a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field in among the piled mountains of cloud there was a melancholy wind and the marsh were very dismal
a stranger would have found them insupportable and even to me they were so oppressive that i hesitated half inclined to go back
but i knew them well and could have found my way on a far darker night and had no excuse for returning being there
the direction that i took was not that in which my old home lay nor that in which we had pursued the convict
my back was turned towards the distant hulks as i walked on and though i could see the old light away on the spits of sand i saw them over my shoulder
i knew the limekiln as well as i knew the old battery but they were miles apart so that if a light had been burning at each point that night there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks
at first i had to shut some gate after me and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds
so having come there against my inclination i went on against it but after a little while i seemed to have the whole flats to myself
the lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell but the fire were made up and left and no workmen were visible
it lay directly in my way and had been worked that day as i saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about
coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation for the rude path lay through it i saw a light in the old sluice house
it was another half hour before i drew near to the kiln hard by was a small stone quarry i quickened my pace and knocked at the door with my hand
waiting for some reply i looked about me noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken and how the house of wood with a tiled roof would not be proof against the weather much longer if it were so even now and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me
still there was no answer and i knocked again no answer still and i tried the latch it rose under my hand and the door yielded
looking in i saw a lighted candle on a table a bench and a mattress on a truckle bedstead as there was a loft above i called is there any one here
but no voice answered then i looked at my watch and finding that it was past nine called again is there any one here
there being still no answer i went out at the door irresolute what to do it was beginning to rain fast
seeing nothing save what i had seen already i turned back into the house and stood just within the shelter of the doorway looking out into the night
while i was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back or the candle would not be burning it came into my head to look if the wick were long
i turned round to do so and had taken up the candle in my hand when it was extinguished by some violent shock and the next thing i comprehended was that i had been caught in a strong running noose thrown over my head from behind
now said a suppressed voice with an oath i ve got you what is this i cried struggling
not only were my arm pulled close to my side but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain
sometimes a strong man hand sometimes a strong man breast was set against my mouth to deaden my cries and with a hot breath always close to me i struggled ineffectually in the dark while i was fastened tight to the wall
who is it help help help and now said the suppressed voice with another oath call out again and i ll make short work of you
faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm bewildered by the surprise and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution i desisted and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little
but it was bound too tight for that i felt as if having been burnt before it were now being boiled
the sudden exclusion of the night and the substitution of black darkness in its place warned me that the man had closed a shutter
i strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder and upon which he breathed and breathed match in hand but i could only see his lips and the blue point of the match even those but fitfully
after groping about for a little he found the flint and steel he wanted and began to strike a light the tinder was damp no wonder there and one after another
as the sparks fell thick and bright about him i could see his hand and touches of his face and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table but nothing more
presently i saw his blue lips again breathing on the tinder and then a flare of light flashed up and showed me old_orlick
the sparks died out the man was in no hurry and struck again with the flint and steel whom i had looked for i dont know
i had not looked for him seeing him i felt that i was in a dangerous strait indeed and i kept my eye upon him
then he put the candle away from him on the table so that he could see me and sat with his arm folded on the table and looked at me
i made out that i was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall a fixture there the means of ascent to the loft above
he lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation and dropped the match and trod it out now said he when we had surveyed one another for some time i ve got you
unbind me let me go ah he returned i ll let you go i ll let you go to the moon i ll let you go to the stars
all in good time why have you lured me here dont you know said he with a deadly look
why have you set upon me in the dark because i mean to do it all myself one keeps a secret better than two
his enjoyment of the spectacle i furnished as he sat with his arm folded on the table shaking his head at me and hugging himself had a malignity in it that made me tremble
as i watched him in silence he put his hand into the corner at his side and took up a gun with a brass bound stock
o you enemy you enemy do you know this said he making as if he would take aim at me
do you know where you saw it afore speak wolf yes i answered you cost me that place
you did speak what else could i do you did that and that would be enough without more how dared you to come betwixt me and a young woman i liked
when did i when didnt you it was you as always give old_orlick a bad name to her you gave it to yourself you gained it for yourself
i could have done you no harm if you had done yourself none you re a liar and you ll take any pains and spend any money to drive me out of this country will you
said he repeating my word to biddy in the last interview i had with her now i ll tell you a piece of information
it was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to night ah if it was all your money twenty time told to the last brass farden
as he shook his heavy hand at me with his mouth snarling like a tiger i felt that it was true
i a going said he bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force i m
he leaned forward staring at me slowly unclenched his hand and drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me and sat down again
what are you going to do to me a going to have your life you was always in old_orlick way since ever you was a child
you goes out of his way this present night he ll have no more on you you re dead i felt that i had come to the brink of my grave
more than that said he folding his arm on the table again i wont have a rag of you i wont have a bone of you left on earth
i ll put your body in the kiln i carry two such to it on my shoulder and let people suppose what they may of you they shall never know nothing
for a moment i looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape but there was none my mind with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences of such a death
miss_estella father would believe i had deserted him would be taken would die accusing me even herbert_pocket would doubt me when he compared the letter i had left for him with the fact that i had called at miss_havisham gate for only a moment mrs_joe_gargery and biddy would never know how sorry i had been that night none would ever know what i had suffered how true i had meant to be what an agony i had passed through
the death close before me was terrible but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death
and so quick were my thought that i saw myself despised by unborn generations miss_estella child and their child while the wretch word were yet on his lips
now wolf said he afore i kill you like any other beast which is wot i mean to do and wot i have tied you up for i ll
it had passed through my thought to cry out for help again though few could know better than i the solitary nature of the spot and the hopelessness of aid
have a good look at you and a good goad at you you enemy but as he sat gloating over me i was supported by a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips
above all thing i resolved that i would not entreat him and that i would die making some last poor resistance to him
softened as my thought of all the rest of man were in that dire extremity humbly beseeching pardon as i did of heaven melted at heart as i was by the thought that i had taken no farewell and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me or could explain myself to them or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors still if i could have killed him even in dying i would have done it
around his neck was slung a tin bottle as i had often seen his meat and drink slung about him in other day
he brought the bottle to his lips and took a fiery drink from it and i smelt the strong spirits that i saw flash into his face
he had been drinking and his eye were red and bloodshot wolf said he folding his arm again old_orlick a going to tell you somethink
again my mind with its former inconceivable rapidity had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister her illness and her death before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these word
it was you as did for your shrew sister it was you villain said i i tell you it was your doing i
tell you it was done through you he retorted catching up the gun and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us
i left her for dead and if there had been a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you she shouldnt have come to life again
i come upon her from behind as i come upon you to night i giv it her but it warnt old_orlick
as did it it was you you was favored and he was bullied and beat old_orlick bullied and beat eh
now you pays for it you done it now you pays for it he drank again and became more ferocious
i saw by his tilting of the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it i distinctly understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an end of me
i knew that when i was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before like my own warning ghost he would do as he had done in my sister case make all haste to the town and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses
my rapid mind pursued him to the town made a picture of the street with him in it and contrasted its light and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapor creeping over it into which i should have dissolved
it was not only that i could have summed up year and year and year while he said a dozen word but that what he did say presented pictures to me and not mere word
in the excited and exalted state of my brain i could not think of a place without seeing it or of person without seeing them
it is impossible to overstate the vividness of these images and yet i was so intent all the time upon him himself who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring that
i knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life i knew of the slightest action of his finger
when he had drunk this second time he rose from the bench on which he sat and pushed the table aside
then he took up the candle and shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me stood before me looking at me and enjoying the sight
wolf i ll tell you something more it was old_orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night
i saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps i saw the shadows of the heavy stair rails thrown by the watchman lantern on the wall
i saw the room that i was never to see again here a door half open there a door closed all the articles of furniture around
you and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country so far as getting a easy living in it goes and i ve took up with new companions and new masters
and why was old_orlick there i ll tell you something more wolf some of em writes my letters when i wants em wrote do
i ve had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life since you was down here at your sister burying
you mind writes my letters wolf they writes fifty hand they re not like sneaking you as writes but one i hant seen a way to get you safe and i ve looked arter you to know your ins and outs
for says old_orlick to himself somehow or another i ll have him what when i look for you i finds your uncle mr_provis eh
mr_provis in his room the signal whose use was over pretty clara the good motherly woman old bill_barley on his back all drifting by as on the swift stream of my life fast running out to sea
mill pond bank and chinks basin and the old green copper rope walk all so clear and plain you with a uncle too
why i know you at mrs_joe_gargery when you was so small a wolf that i could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead as i thought doing odd time when i see you loitering amongst the pollards on a sunday and you hadnt found no uncles then
but when old_orlick come for to hear that your uncle mr_provis had most like wore the leg iron wot old_orlick had picked up filed asunder on these meshes ever so many year ago and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it like a bullock as he means to drop you hey when he come for to hear that hey
in his savage taunting he flared the candle so close at me that i turned my face aside to save it from the flame
old_orlick knowed you was burnt old_orlick knowed you was smuggling your uncle mr_provis away old_orlick a match for you and
no not you ah he cried laughing after doing it again the burnt child dreads the fire know you come to night
now i ll tell you something more wolf and this ends it there them that as good a match for your uncle mr_provis as old_orlick has been for you
let him ware them when no man cant find a rag of his dear relation clothes nor yet a bone of his body
i know the name alive in the same land with them and that had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land as that he couldnt and shouldnt leave it unbeknown and put them in danger
let him ware them when he lost his nevvy there them that cant and that wont have abel_magwitch yes raps it them that writes fifty hand and that not like sneaking you as writes but one
he flared the candle at me again smoking my face and hair and for an instant blinding me and turned his powerful back as he replaced the light on the table
ware compeyson abel_magwitch and the gallows i had thought a prayer and had been with mrs_joe_gargery and biddy and herbert_pocket before he turned towards me again
there was a clear space of a few foot between the table and the opposite wall within this space he now slouched backwards and forwards
his great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before as he did this with his hand hanging loose and heavy at his side and with his eye scowling at me
wild as my inward hurry was and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thought i could yet clearly understand that unless he had resolved that i was within a few moment of surely perishing out of all human knowledge he would never have told me what he had told
i had no grain of hope left of a sudden he stopped took the cork out of his bottle and tossed it away
light as it was i heard it fall like a plummet he swallowed slowly tilting up the bottle by little and little and now he looked at me no more
then with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly he threw the bottle from him and stooped and i saw in his hand a stone hammer with a long heavy handle
the resolution i had made did not desert me for without uttering one vain word of appeal to him i shouted out with all my might and struggled with all my might
it was only my head and my leg that i could move but to that extent i struggled with all the force until then unknown that was within me
in the same instant i heard responsive shouts saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door heard voice and tumult and saw old_orlick emerge from a struggle of man as if it were tumbling water clear the table at a leap and fly out into the night
after a blank i found that i was lying unbound on the floor in the same place with my head on some one knee
my eye were fixed on the ladder against the wall when i came to myself had opened on it before my mind saw it and thus as i recovered consciousness i knew that i was in the place where i had lost it
too indifferent at first even to look round and ascertain who supported me i was lying looking at the ladder when there came between me and it a face
the last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his hand and licked up the face of mr_trabb boy
at these word the face of him who supported me looked over into mine and i saw my supporter to be herbert_pocket
i think he all right said mr_trabb boy in a sober voice but aint he just pale though great heaven
softly said herbert_pocket gently handel dont be too eager and our old comrade startop i cried as he too bent over me
remember what he is going to assist us in said herbert_pocket and be calm the allusion made me spring up though i dropped again from the pain in my arm
the time has not gone by herbert_pocket has it what night is to night how long have i been here
for i had a strange and strong misgiving that i had been lying there a long time a day and a night two day and night more
the time has not gone by it is still monday night thank god and you have all to morrow tuesday to rest in said herbert_pocket
but you cant help groaning my dear handel what hurt have you got can you stand yes yes said i i can walk
i have no hurt but in this throbbing arm they laid it bare and did what they could it was violently swollen and inflamed and i could scarcely endure to have it touched
but they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages and carefully replaced it in the sling until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it
in a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice house and were passing through the quarry on our way back
mr_trabb boy mr_trabb overgrown young man now went before us with a lantern which was the light i had seen come in at the door
but the moon was a good two hour higher than when i had last seen the sky and the night though rainy was much lighter
the white vapor of the kiln was passing from us as we went by and as i had thought a prayer before i thought a thanksgiving now
entreating herbert_pocket to tell me how he had come to my rescue which at first he had flatly refused to do but had insisted on my remaining quiet i learnt that i had in my hurry dropped the letter open in our chambers where he coming home to bring with him startop whom he had met in the street on his way to me found it very soon after i was gone
its tone made him uneasy and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter i had left for him
his uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding after a quarter of an hour consideration he set off for the coach office with startop who volunteered his company to make inquiry when the next coach went down
finding that the afternoon coach was gone and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm as obstacles came in his way he resolved to follow in a post chaise
so he and startop arrived at the blue_boar fully expecting there to find me or tidings of me but finding neither went on to miss_havisham where they lost me
hereupon they went back to the hotel doubtless at about the time when i was hearing the popular local version of my own story to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marsh
among the loungers under the boar archway happened to be mr_trabb boy true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business and
thus mr_trabb boy became their guide and with him they went out to the sluice house though by the town way to the marsh which i had avoided
now as they went along herbert_pocket reflected that i might after all have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to mr_provis safety and bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous left his guide and startop on the edge of the quarry and went on by himself and stole round the house two or three time endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within
as he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice this was while my mind was so busy he even at last began to doubt whether i was there when suddenly i cried out loudly and he answered the cries and rushed in closely followed by the other two
when i told herbert_pocket what had passed within the house he was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town late at night as it was and getting out a warrant
but i had already considered that such a course by detaining us there or binding us to come back might be fatal to mr_provis
mr_trabb boy had seen me passing from miss_havisham in the direction of my dining place there was no gainsaying this difficulty and we relinquished all thought of pursuing old_orlick at that time
for the present under the circumstance we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to mr_trabb boy who i am convinced would have been much affected by disappointment if he had known that his intervention saved me from the limekiln
not that mr_trabb boy was of a malignant nature but that he had too much spare vivacity and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody expense
when we parted i presented him with two guineas which seemed to meet his views and told him that i was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him which made no impression on him at all
wednesday being so close upon us we determined to go back to london that night three in the post chaise the rather as we should then be clear away before the night adventure began to be talked of
herbert_pocket got a large bottle of stuff for my arm and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through i was just able to bear its pain on the journey
it was daylight when we reached the temple and i went at once to bed and lay in bed all day
my terror as i lay there of falling ill and being unfitted for to morrow was so besetting that i wonder it did not disable me of itself
it would have done so pretty surely in conjunction with the mental wear and tear i had suffered but for the unnatural strain upon me that to morrow was
no precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him that day yet this again increased my restlessness
i started at every footstep and every sound believing that he was discovered and taken and this was the messenger to tell me so
i persuaded myself that i knew he was taken that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment that the fact had occurred and i had a mysterious knowledge of it
as the day wore on and no ill news came as the day closed in and darkness fell my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to morrow morning altogether mastered me
so anxiously looked forward to charged with such consequences its results so impenetrably hidden though so near my burning arm throbbed and my burning head throbbed and i fancied i was beginning to wander
i counted up to high numbers to make sure of myself and repeated passages that i knew in prose and verse
it happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind i dozed for some moment or forgot then i would say to myself with a start now it has come and i am turning delirious
whenever i fell asleep i awoke with the notion i had had in the sluice house that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him was gone
about midnight i got out of bed and went to herbert_pocket with the conviction that i had been asleep for four and twenty hour and that wednesday was past
they kept me very quiet all day and kept my arm constantly dressed and gave me cooling drinks it was the last self exhausting effort of my fretfulness for after that i slept soundly
the winking light upon the bridges were already pale the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon
the river still dark and mysterious was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky
as i looked along the clustered roofs with church towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air the sun rose up and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river and millions of sparkles burst out upon its water
wednesday morning was dawning when i looked out of window from me too a veil seemed to be drawn and i felt strong and well
i could not dress myself without help but i made up the fire which was still burning and got some coffee ready for them
in good time they too started up strong and well and we admitted the sharp morning air at the window and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us
when it turns at nine clock said herbert_pocket cheerfully look out for us and stand ready you over there at mill pond bank
it was one of those march day when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold when it is summer in the light and winter in the shade
herbert_pocket lay asleep in his bed and our old fellow student lay asleep on the sofa chapter liv we had our pea coats with us and i took a bag
where i might go what i might do or when i might return were question utterly unknown to me nor did i vex my mind with them for it was wholly set on mr_provis safety
i only wondered for the passing moment as i stopped at the door and looked back under what altered circumstance i should next see those room if ever
we loitered down to the temple stairs and stood loitering there as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all
of all my worldly possessions i took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag of course i had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order
after a little show of indecision which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our temple stairs we went on board and cast off herbert_pocket in the bow i steering
the tide beginning to run down at nine and being with us until three we intended still to creep on after it had turned and row against it until dark
we should then be well in those long reaches below gravesend between kent and essex where the river is broad and solitary where the water side inhabitants are very few and where lone public house are scattered here and there of which we could choose one for a resting place
it was then about high water half past eight our plan was this there we meant to lie by all night the steamer for hamburg and the steamer for rotterdam would start from london at about nine on thursday morning
we should know at what time to expect them according to where we were and would hail the first so that if by any accident we were not taken abroad we should have another chance
the relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was so great to me that i felt it difficult to realize the condition in which i had been a few hour before
the crisp air the sunlight the movement on the river and the moving river itself the road that ran with us seeming to sympathize with us animate us and encourage us
i felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat but there were few better oarsmen than my two friend and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day
at that time the steam traffic on the thames was far below its present extent and watermen boat were far more numerous
of barges sailing colliers and coasting traders there were perhaps as many as now but of steam ships great and small not a tithe or a twentieth part so many
early as it was there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide the navigation of the river between bridges in an open boat was a much easier and commoner matter in those day than it is in these and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly
old london bridge was soon passed and old billingsgate market with its oyster boat and dutchmen and the white tower and traitor gate and we were in among the tiers of shipping
here were the leith aberdeen and glasgow steamers loading and unloading goods and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside here were colliers by the score and score with the coal whippers plunging off stages on deck as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up which were then rattled over the side into barges here at her moorings was to morrow steamer for rotterdam of which we took good notice and here to morrow for hamburg under whose bowsprit we crossed
we knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel on freshened me with new hope and now i sitting in the stern could see with a faster beating heart
mill pond bank and mill pond stairs is he there said herbert_pocket not yet right he was not to come down till he saw us
can you see his signal not well from here but i think i see it now i see him pull both
easy herbert_pocket oars we touched the stairs lightly for a single moment and he was on board and we were off again
he had a boat cloak with him and a black canvas bag and he looked as like a river pilot as my heart could have wished
dear boy he said putting his arm on my shoulder as he took his seat faithful dear boy well done
again among the tiers of shipping in and out avoiding rusty chain cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys sinking for the moment floating broken baskets scattering floating chips of wood and shaving cleaving floating scum of coal in and out under the figure head of the john of sunderland making a speech to the winds as is done by many johns and the betsy of yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and her knobby eye starting two inches out of her head in and out hammers going in ship builders yards saws going at timber clashing engines going at thing unknown pumps going in leaky ships capstans going ships going out to sea and unintelligible sea creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen in and out out at last upon the clearer river where the ships boy might take their fenders in no longer fishing in troubled water with them over the side and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind
at the stairs where we had taken him abroad and ever since i had looked warily for any token of our being suspected
we certainly had not been and at that time as certainly we were not either attended or followed by any boat
if we had been waited on by any boat i should have run in to shore and have obliged her to go on or to make her purpose evident
thankye thankye i had seen none but we held our own without any appearance of molestation he had his boat cloak on him and looked as i have said a natural part of the scene
it was remarkable but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it that he was the least anxious of any of us
he was not indifferent for he told me that he hoped to live to see his gentleman one of the best of gentleman in a foreign country he was not disposed to be passive or resigned as i understood it but he had no notion of meeting danger half way
if you knowed dear boy he said to me what it is to sit here alonger my dear boy and have my smoke arter having been day by day betwixt four wall you envy me
when it came upon him he confronted it but it must come before he troubled himself but you dont know what it is
i think i know the delights of freedom i answered ah said he shaking his head gravely but you dont know it equal to me
you must have been under lock and key dear boy to know it equal to me but i aint a going to be low
it occurred to me as inconsistent that for any mastering idea he should have endangered his freedom and even his life
but i reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man
i was not far out since he said after smoking a little you see dear boy when i was over yondert other side the world i was always a looking to this side and it come flat to be there for all i was a growing rich
everybody knowed abel_magwitch and abel_magwitch could come and abel_magwitch could go and nobody head would be troubled about him they aint so easy concerning me here
dear boy wouldnt be leastwise if they knowed where i was if all goes well said i you will be perfectly free and safe again within a few hour
he dipped his hand in the water over the boat gunwale and said smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me
well he returned drawing a long breath i hope so and think so ay i pose i think so dear boy
we be puzzled to be more quiet and easy going than we are at present but it a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water
p raps as makes me think it i was a thinking through my smoke just then that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hour than we can see to the bottom of this river what i catches hold of
nor yet we cant no more hold their tide than i can hold this and it run through my finger and gone you see
but for your face i should think you were a little despondent said i not a bit on it dear boy
it comes of flowing on so quiet and of that there rippling at the boat head making a sort of a sunday tune
he put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of face and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of england
yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror for when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat and he was stepping out
holding up his dripping hand maybe i a growing a trifle old besides i hinted that i thought he would be safest where he was and he said
do you dear boy and quietly sat down again the air felt cold upon the river but it was a bright day and the sunshine was very cheering
the tide ran strong i took care to lose none of it and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well
by imperceptible degrees as the tide ran out we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks but the tide was yet with us when we were off gravesend
as our charge was wrapped in his cloak i purposely passed within a boat or two length of the floating custom house and so out to catch the stream alongside of two emigrant ships and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us
and soon the tide began to slacken and the craft lying at anchor to swing and presently they had all swung round and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet and we kept under the shore as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks
our oarsmen were so fresh by dint of having occasionally let her drive with the tide for a minute or two that a quarter of an hour rest proved full as much as they wanted
it was like my own marsh country flat and monotonous and with a dim horizon while the winding river turned and turned and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned and everything else seemed stranded and still
for now the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed and the last green barge straw laden with a brown sail had followed and some ballast lighters shaped like a child first rude imitation of a boat lay low in the mud and a little squat shoal lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud and slimy stones stuck out of the mud and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud and an old landing stage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud and all about us was stagnation and mud
we got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us and looked about we pushed off again and made what way we could
it was much harder work now but herbert_pocket and startop persevered and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down
there was the red sun on the low level of the shore in a purple haze fast deepening into black and there was the solitary flat marsh and far away there were the rising grounds between which and us there seemed to be no life save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull
as the night was fast falling and as the moon being past the full would not rise early we held a little council a short one for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find
by that time the river had lifted us a little so that we could see above the bank so they plied their oars once more and i looked out for anything like a house
it was very cold and a collier coming by us with her galley fire smoking and flaring looked like a comfortable home
the night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning and what light we had seemed to come more from the river than the sky as the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars
thus we held on speaking little for four or five dull miles at this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed
as the tide made it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore and whenever such a sound came one or other of us was sure to start and look in that direction
here and there the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek and we were all suspicious of such place and eyed them nervously
sometimes what was that ripple one of us would say in a low voice or another is that a boat yonder
and afterwards we would fall into a dead silence and i would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels
at length we descried a light and a roof and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by
leaving the rest in the boat i stepped ashore and found the light to be in a window of a public house
it was a dirty place enough and i dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers but there was a good fire in the kitchen and there were eggs and bacon to eat and various liquors to drink
no other company was in the house than the landlord his wife and a grizzled male creature the jack of the little causeway who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low water mark too
with this assistant i went down to the boat again and we all came ashore and brought out the oars and rudder and boat hook and all else and hauled her up for the night
we made a very good meal by the kitchen fire and then apportioned the bedrooms herbert_pocket and startop were to occupy one i and our charge the other
we found the air as carefully excluded from both as if air were fatal to life and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the bed than i should have thought the family possessed
also there were two double bedded room such as they were the landlord said but we considered ourselves well off notwithstanding for a more solitary place we could not have found
while we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal the jack who was sitting in a corner and who had a bloated pair of shoes on which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon as interesting relics that he had taken a few day ago from the foot of a drowned seaman washed ashore asked me if we had seen a four oared galley going up with the tide
when i told him no he said she must have gone down then and yet she took up too when she left there
they must ha thought better ont for some reason or another said the jack and gone down a four oared galley did you say said i a four said the jack and two sitters
did they come ashore here they put in with a stone two gallon jar for some beer i ha been glad to pison the beer myself said the jack or put some rattling physic in it
why i know why said the jack he spoke in a slushy voice as if much mud had washed into his throat
he thinks said the landlord a weakly meditative man with a pale eye who seemed to rely greatly on his jack he thinks they was what they wasnt
i knows what i thinks observed the jack you thinks custum us jack said the landlord i do said the jack
in the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views the jack took one of his bloated shoes off looked into it knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor and put it on again
then you re wrong jack am i he did this with the air of a jack who was so right that he could afford to do anything
why what do you make out that they done with their buttons then jack asked the landlord vacillating weakly
done with their buttons returned the jack chucked em overboard swallered em sowed em to come up small salad
a custum us officer knows what to do with his buttons said the jack repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt when they comes betwixt him and his own light
a four and two sitters dont go hanging and hovering up with one tide and down with another and both with and against another without there being custum us at the bottom of it
saying which he went out in disdain and the landlord having no one to reply upon found it impracticable to pursue the subject
done with their buttons dont be cheeky jack remonstrated the landlord in a melancholy and pathetic way this dialogue made us all uneasy and me very uneasy
the dismal wind was muttering round the house the tide was flapping at the shore and i had a feeling that we were caged and threatened
a four oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that i could not get rid of
when i had induced mr_provis to go up to bed i went outside with my two companions startop by this time knew the state of the case and held another council
whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer time which would be about one in the afternoon or whether we should put off early in the morning was the question we discussed
on the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were until within an hour or so of the steamer time and then to get out in her track and drift easily with the tide
having settled to do this we returned into the house and went to bed i lay down with the greater part of my clothes on and slept well for a few hour
when i awoke the wind had risen and the sign of the house the ship was creaking and banging about with noises that startled me
it commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat and as my eye adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon i saw two man looking into her
they passed by under the window looking at nothing else and they did not go down to the landing place which i could discern to be empty but struck across the marsh in the direction of the nore
rising softly for my charge lay fast asleep i looked out of the window my first impulse was to call up herbert_pocket and show him the two man going away
but reflecting before i got into his room which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine that he and startop had had a harder day than i and were fatigued i forbore
in that light however i soon lost them and feeling very cold lay down to think of the matter and fell asleep again
as we walked to and fro all four together before breakfast i deemed it right to recount what i had seen
going back to my window i could see the two man moving over the marsh we were up early again our charge was the least anxious of the party
it was very likely that the man belonged to the custom house he said quietly and that they had no thought of us
however i proposed that he and i should walk away together to a distant point we could see and that the boat should take us aboard there or as near there as might prove feasible at about noon
i tried to persuade myself that it was so as indeed it might easily be this being considered a good precaution soon after breakfast he and i set forth without saying anything at the tavern
he smoked his pipe as we went along and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder one would have supposed that it was i who was in danger not he and that he was reassuring me
as we approached the point i begged him to remain in a sheltered place while i went on to reconnoitre for it was towards it that the man had passed in the night
there was no boat off the point nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it nor were there any signs of the man having embarked there
we spoke very little he complied and i went on alone but to be sure the tide was high and there might have been some footpints under water
when he looked out from his shelter in the distance and saw that i waved my hat to him to come up he rejoined me and there we waited sometimes lying on the bank wrapped in our coats and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves until we saw our boat coming round
we got aboard easily and rowed out into the track of the steamer by that time it wanted but ten minutes of one clock and we began to look out for her smoke
but it was half past one before we saw her smoke and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer
as they were coming on at full speed we got the two bags ready and took that opportunity of saying good bye to herbert_pocket and startop
we had all shaken hand cordially and neither herbert_pocket eye nor mine were quite dry when i saw a four oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us and row out into the same track
a stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer smoke by reason of the bend and wind of the river but now she was visible coming head on
i called to herbert_pocket and startop to keep before the tide that she might see us lying by for her and i adjured mr_provis to sit quite still wrapped in his cloak
he answered cheerily trust to me dear boy and sat like a statue meantime the galley which was very skilfully handled had crossed us let us come up with her and fallen alongside
leaving just room enough for the play of the oars she kept alongside drifting when we drifted and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled
attentively as did all the rowers the other sitter was wrapped up much as mr_provis was and seemed to shrink and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us
startop could make out after a few minutes which steamer was first and gave me the word hamburg in a low voice as we sat face to face
of the two sitters one held the rudder lines and looked at us not a word was spoken in either boat she was nearing us very fast and the beating of her peddles grew louder and louder
i felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us when the galley hailed us i answered you have a returned transport there said the man who held the lines
that the man wrapped in the cloak his name is abel_magwitch otherwise mr_provis i apprehend that man and call upon him to surrender and you to assist
they had pulled one sudden stroke ahead had got their oars in had run athwart us and were holding on to our gunwale before we knew what they were doing
this caused great confusion on board the steamer and i heard them calling to us and heard the order given to stop the paddles and heard them stop but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly
in the same moment i saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner shoulder and saw that both boat were swinging round with the force of the tide and saw that all hand on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically
still in the same moment i saw the prisoner start up lean across his captor and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley
still in the same moment i saw that the face disclosed was the face of the other convict of long ago
still in the same moment i saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that i shall never forget and heard a great cry on board the steamer and a loud splash in the water and felt the boat sink from under me
it was but for an instant that i seemed to struggle with a thousand mill weirs and a thousand flashes of light that instant past i was taken on board the galley
at the same moment without giving any audible direction to his crew he ran the galley abroad of us herbert_pocket was there and startop was there but our boat was gone and the two convict were gone
what with the cries aboard the steamer and the furious blowing off of her steam and her driving on and our driving on i could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore but the crew of the galley righted her with great speed and pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead lay upon their oars every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern
no man spoke but the steersman held up his hand and all softly backed water and kept the boat straight and true before it
presently a dark object was seen in it bearing towards us on the tide as it came nearer i saw it to be abel_magwitch swimming but not swimming freely
he was taken on board and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles the galley was kept steady and the silent eager look out at the water was resumed
by the time she had been hailed and stopped both steamers were drifting away from us and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water
the look out was kept long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone but everybody knew that it was hopeless now
at length we gave it up and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left where we were received with no little surprise
but the rotterdam steamer now came up and apparently not understanding what had happened came on at speed here i was able to get some comforts for abel_magwitch mr_provis
he told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer and to have been struck on the head in rising
the injury to his chest which rendered his breathing extremely painful he thought he had received against the side of the galley
he added that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to compeyson but that in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him that villain had staggered up and staggered back and they had both gone overboard together when the sudden wrenching of him abel_magwitch out of our boat and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it had capsized us
he told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each other arm and that there had been a struggle under water and that he had disengaged himself struck out and swum away
no longer who had received some very severe injury in the chest and a deep cut in the head i never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me
when i asked this officer permission to change the prisoner wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments i could get at the public house he gave it readily merely observing that he must take charge of everything his prisoner had about him
the officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard so the pocket book which had once been in my hand passed into the officer
he further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to london but declined to accord that grace to my two friend
the jack at the ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down and undertook to search for the body in the place where it was likeliest to come ashore
probably it took about a dozen drowned man to fit him out completely and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay
we remained at the public house until the tide turned and then abel_magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board
his interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on herbert_pocket and startop were to get to london by land as soon as they could
we had a doleful parting and when i took my place by abel_magwitch side i felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived
for now my repugnance to him had all melted away and in the hunted wounded shackled creature who held my hand in his i only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor and who had felt affectionately gratefully and generously towards me with great constancy through a series of year
i only saw in him a much better man than i had been to mrs_joe_gargery his breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on and often he could not repress a groan
i tried to rest him on the arm i could use in any easy position but it was dreadful to think that i could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt since it was unquestionably best that he should die
that there were still living people enough who were able and willing to identify him i could not doubt that he would be leniently treated i could not hope
he who had been presented in the worst light at his trial who had since broken prison and had been tried again who had returned from transportation under a life sentence and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his arrest
as we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back i told him how grieved i was to think that he had come home for my sake
dear boy he answered i quite content to take my chance i ve seen my boy and he can be a gentleman without me
no i had thought about that while we had been there side by side no apart from any inclinations of my own i understood mr_wemmick hint now
i foresaw that being convicted his possessions would be forfeited to the crown lookee here dear boy said he it best as a gentleman should not be knowed to belong to me now
sit where i can see you when i am swore to for the last many time and i dont ask no more
only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger mr_wemmick i will never stir from your side said i when i am suffered to be near you
i felt his hand tremble as it held mine and he turned his face away as he lay in the bottom of the boat and i heard that old sound in his throat softened now like all the rest of him
it was a good thing that he had touched this point for it put into my mind what i might not otherwise have thought of until too late that
please god i will be as true to you as you have been to me he need never know how his hopes of enriching me had perished
he was taken to the police court next day and would have been immediately committed for trial but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison ship from which he had once escaped to speak to his identity
nobody doubted it but compeyson who had meant to depose to it was tumbling on the tides dead and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in london who could give the required evidence
i had gone direct to mr_jaggers at his private house on my arrival over night to retain his assistance and mr_jaggers on the prisoner behalf would admit nothing
it was the sole resource for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us
mr_jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having let it slip through my finger and said we must memorialize by and by and try at all events for some of it
but he did not conceal from me that although there might be many case in which the forfeiture would not be exacted there were no circumstance in this case to make it one of them
chapter lv i imparted to mr_jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth i understood that very well
i was not related to the outlaw or connected with him by any recognizable tie he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension and to do so now would be idle
i had no claim and i finally resolved and ever afterwards abided by the resolution that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one
there appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture and had obtained some accurate knowledge of abel_magwitch affairs
when his body was found many miles from the scene of his death and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognizable by the contents of his pocket notes were still legible folded in a case he carried
among these were the name of a banking house in new south wales where a sum of money was and the designation of certain lands of considerable value
both these head of information were in a list that abel_magwitch while in prison gave to mr_jaggers of the possessions he supposed i should inherit
his ignorance poor fellow at last served him he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe with mr_jaggers aid
after three day delay during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison ship the witness came and completed the easy case
it was at this dark time of my life that herbert_pocket returned home one evening a good deal cast down and said
he was committed to take his trial at the next sessions which would come on in a month my dear handel i fear i shall soon have to leave you
we shall lose a fine opportunity if i put off going to cairo and i am very much afraid i must go handel when you most need me
herbert_pocket i shall always need you because i shall always love you but my need is no greater now than at another time
his partner having prepared me for that i was less surprised than he thought you will be so lonely
you know that i am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed and that i should be with him all day long if i could
i have not leisure to think of that said i and when i come away from him you know that my thought are with him
the dreadful condition to which he was brought was so appalling to both of us that we could not refer to it in plainer word
my dear fellow said herbert_pocket let the near prospect of our separation for it is very near be my justification for troubling you about yourself
have you thought of your future no for i have been afraid to think of any future
but yours cannot be dismissed indeed my dear dear handel it must not be dismissed i wish you would enter on it now as far as a few friendly word go with me
i will said i in this branch house of ours handel we must have a i saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word so i said
and i hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded into a partner
there was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying now handel as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium he had suddenly given up that tone stretched out his honest hand and spoken like a schoolboy
clara and i have talked about it again and again herbert_pocket pursued and the dear little thing begged me only this evening with tears in her eye to say to you that if you will live with us when we come together she will do her best to make you happy and to convince her husband friend that he is her friend too
a clerk a clerk now handel in short my dear boy will you come to me we should get on so well handel
i thanked her heartily and i thanked him heartily but said i could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered
secondly there was a vague something lingering in my thought that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative
but if you thought herbert_pocket that you could without doing any injury to your business leave the question open for a little while for any while cried herbert_pocket
firstly my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly secondly yes six months a year
herbert_pocket was highly delighted when we shook hand on this arrangement and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week
and clara said i the dear little thing returned herbert_pocket holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts but he wont last long
not so long as that said i two or three months at most mrs whimple confides to me that he is certainly going
not to say an unfeeling thing said i he cannot do better than go i am afraid that must be admitted said herbert_pocket
and then i shall come back for the dear little thing and the dear little thing and i will walk quietly into the nearest church
the blessed darling comes of no family my dear handel and never looked into the red book and hasnt a notion about her grandpapa
on the saturday in that same week i took my leave of herbert_pocket full of bright hope but sad and sorry to leave me as
i went into a coffee house to write a little note to clara telling her he had gone off sending his love to her over and over again and then went to my lonely
remember what a fortune for the son of my mother he sat on one of the seaport mail coach home if it deserved the name for it was now no home to me and i had no home anywhere
i had not seen him alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight and he had come in his private and personal capacity to say a few word of explanation in reference to that failure
on the stairs i encountered mr_wemmick who was coming down after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door
the late compeyson said mr_wemmick had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted and it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble some of his people being always in trouble that i heard what i did
i kept my ears open seeming to have them shut until i heard that he was absent and i thought that would be the best time for making the attempt
i can only suppose now that it was a part of his policy as a very clever man habitually to deceive his own instruments
i am as sure of that mr_wemmick as you can be and i thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship
you dont blame me i hope mr_pip i am sure i tried to serve you with all my heart
it a bad job said mr_wemmick scratching his head and i assure you i havent been so cut up for a long time
thank you thank you very much what i look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property dear me what i think of mr_wemmick is the poor owner of the property
of course there can be no objection to your being sorry for him and i put down a five pound note myself to get him out of it
the late compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return and being so determined to bring him to book i do not think he could have been saved
yes to be sure said mr_wemmick but what i look at is this whereas the portable property certainly could have been saved
that the difference between the property and the owner dont you see i invited mr_wemmick to come upstairs and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to walworth
while he was drinking his moderate allowance he said with nothing to lead up to it and after having appeared rather fidgety
he accepted the invitation what do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on monday mr_pip why i suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months
these twelve year more likely said mr_wemmick yes i going to take a holiday more than that i going to take a walk
more than that i going to ask you to take a walk with me i was about to excuse myself as being but a bad companion just then when mr_wemmick anticipated me
i know your engagements said he and i know you are out of sorts mr_pip but if you could oblige me i should take it as a kindness
it aint a long walk and it an early one say it might occupy you including breakfast on the walk from eight to twelve
couldnt you stretch a point and manage it he had done so much for me at various time that this was very little to do for him
i said i could manage it would manage it and he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence that i was pleased too
at his particular request i appointed to call for him at the castle at half past eight on monday morning and so we parted for the time
punctual to my appointment i rang at the castle gate on the monday morning and was received by mr_wemmick himself who struck me as looking tighter than usual and having a sleeker hat on
the aged must have been stirring with the lark for glancing into the perspective of his bedroom i observed that his bed was empty
when we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us i was considerably surprised to see mr_wemmick take up a fishing rod and put it over his shoulder
within there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared and two biscuits why we are not going fishing said i no returned mr_wemmick but i like to walk with one
i thought this odd however i said nothing and we set off we went towards camberwell green and when we were thereabouts mr_wemmick said suddenly
there was nothing very surprising in that but again i was rather surprised when he said as if he were animated by a brilliant idea
halloa here a church let go in we went in mr_wemmick leaving his fishing rod in the porch and looked all round
in the mean time mr_wemmick was diving into his coat pocket and getting something out of paper there halloa said he
as the gloves were white kid gloves and as the post office was widened to its utmost extent i now began to have my strong suspicions
here a couple of pair of gloves let put em on they were strengthened into certainty when i beheld the aged enter at a side door escorting a lady
that discreet damsel was attired as usual except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white
halloa said mr_wemmick here miss_skiffins let have a wedding the aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of hymen
the old gentleman however experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on that mr_wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them while i for my part held the old gentleman round the waist that he might present an equal and safe resistance
by dint of this ingenious scheme his gloves were got on to perfection the clerk and clergyman then appearing we were ranged in order at those fatal rails
true to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation i heard mr_wemmick say to himself as he took something out of his waistcoat pocket before the service began halloa
i acted in the capacity of backer or best man to the bridegroom while a little limp pew opener in a soft bonnet like a baby made a feint of being the bosom friend of miss_skiffins
the responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the aged which led to the clergyman being unintentionally scandalized and it happened thus
when he said who giveth this woman to be married to this man the old gentleman not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments
the old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice
here a ring upon which the clergyman said again who giveth this woman to be married to this man now aged you know who giveth
to which the aged replied with great briskness before saying that he gave all right john all right my boy
and the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it that i had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day
it was completely done however and when we were going out of church mr_wemmick took the cover off the font and put his white gloves in it and put the cover on again
now mr_pip said mr_wemmick triumphantly shouldering the fishing rod as we came out let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a wedding party
breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green and there was a bagatelle board in the room in case we should desire to unbend our mind after the solemnity
it was pleasant to observe that mrs mr_wemmick no longer unwound mr_wemmick arm when it adapted itself to her figure but sat in a high backed chair against the wall like a violoncello in its case and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done
we had an excellent breakfast and when any one declined anything on table mr_wemmick said provided by contract you know dont be afraid of it
mrs mr_wemmick more heedful of the future put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green
i drank to the new couple drank to the aged drank to the castle saluted the bride at parting and made myself as agreeable as i could
mr_wemmick came down to the door with me and i again shook hand with him and wished him joy thankee said mr_wemmick rubbing his hand
she such a manager of fowls you have no idea you shall have some eggs and judge for yourself i say mr_pip
calling me back and speaking low this is altogether a walworth sentiment please i understand not to be mentioned in little britain said i mr_wemmick nodded
after what you let out the other day mr_jaggers may as well not know of it he might think my brain was softening or something of the kind
he lay in prison very ill during the whole interval between his committal for trial and the coming round of the sessions
he had broken two ribs they had wounded one of his lungs and he breathed with great pain and difficulty which increased daily
it was a consequence of his hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible therefore he spoke very little
but he was ever ready to listen to me and it became the first duty of my life to say to him and read to him what i knew he ought to hear
being far too ill to remain in the common prison he was removed after the first day or so into the infirmary
and but for his illness he would have been put in irons for he was regarded as a determined prison breaker and i know not what else
although i saw him every day it was for only a short time hence the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state
i do not recollect that i once saw any change in it for the better he wasted and became slowly weaker and worse day by day from the day when the prison door closed upon him
chapter lvi this gave me opportunities of being with him that i could not otherwise have had the kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man who was tired out
i sometimes derived an impression from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstance
but he never justified himself by a hint tending that way or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape
it happened on two or three occasion in my presence that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him
a smile crossed his face then and he turned his eye on me with a trustful look as if he were confident that i had seen some small redeeming touch in him even so long ago as when i was a little child
when the sessions came round mr_jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following sessions
as to all the rest he was humble and contrite and i never knew him complain it was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long and was refused
no objection was made to my getting close to the dock on the outside of it and holding the hand that he stretched forth to me
the trial came on at once and when he was put to the bar he was seated in a chair the trial was very short and very clear
such thing as could be said for him were said how he had taken to industrious habits and had thriven lawfully and reputably
but nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned and was there in presence of the judge and jury it was impossible to try him for that and do otherwise than find him guilty
at that time it was the custom as i learnt from my terrible experience of that sessions to devote a concluding day to the passing of sentences and to make a finishing effect with the sentence of death
but for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me i could scarcely believe even as i write these word that i saw two and thirty man and woman put before the judge to receive that sentence together
the whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment down to the drops of april rain on the window of the court glittering in the rays of april sun
penned in the dock as i again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine were the two and thirty man and woman some defiant some stricken with terror some sobbing and weeping some covering their face some staring gloomily about
foremost among the two and thirty was he seated that he might get breath enough to keep life in him there had been shrieks from among the woman convict but they had been stilled and a hush had succeeded
the sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays other civic gewgaws and monsters criers ushers a great gallery full of people a large theatrical
among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws who after repeated imprisonments and punishments had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of year and who under circumstance of great violence and daring had made his escape and been re sentenced to exile for life
that miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors when far removed from the scenes of his old offences and to have lived a peaceable and honest life
but in a fatal moment yielding to those propensities and passions the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance and had come back to the country where he was proscribed
being here presently denounced he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of justice but being at length seized while in the act of flight he had resisted them and had he best knew whether by express design or in the blindness of his hardihood caused the death of his denouncer to whom his whole career was known
the appointed punishment for his return to the land that had cast him out being death and his case being this aggravated case he must prepare himself to die
the sun was striking in at the great window of the court through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass and it made a broad shaft of light between the two and thirty and the judge linking both together and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on with absolute equality to the greater judgment that knoweth all thing and cannot err
rising for a moment a distinct speck of face in this way of light the prisoner said my lord i have received my sentence of death from the almighty but i bow to yours and sat down again
audience looked on as the two and thirty and the judge were solemnly confronted then the judge addressed them there was some hushing and the judge went on with what he had to say to the rest
then they were all formally doomed and some of them were supported out and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery and a few nodded to the gallery and two or three shook hand and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about
he went last of all because of having to be helped from his chair and to go very slowly and he held my hand while all the others were removed and while the audience got up putting their dresses right as they might at church or elsewhere and pointed down at this criminal or at that and most of all at him and me
i earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the recorder report was made but in the dread of his lingering on i began that night to write out a petition to the home secretary of state setting forth my knowledge of him and how it was that he had come back for my sake
i wrote it as fervently and pathetically as i could and when i had finished it and sent it in i wrote out other petitions to such man in authority as i hoped were the most merciful and drew up one to the crown itself
for several day and night after he was sentenced i took no rest except when i fell asleep in my chair but was wholly absorbed in these appeals
and after i had sent them in i could not keep away from the place where they were but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when i was near them
in this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind i would roam the streets of an evening wandering by those office and house where i had left the petitions
to the present hour the weary western streets of london on a cold dusty spring night with their ranges of stern shut up mansions and their long rows of lamps are melancholy to me from this association
seeing or fancying that i was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him i asked to be searched before i sat down at his bedside and told the officer who was always there that i was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs
the daily visits i could make him were shortened now and he was more strictly kept nobody was hard with him or with me
the officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse and some other sick prisoners in the room and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses malefactors but not incapable of kindness god be thanked
as the day went on i noticed more and more that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling with an absence of light in his face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant and then it would subside again
sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak then he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand and i grew to understand his meaning very well
the number of the day had risen to ten when i saw a greater change in him than i had seen yet
there was duty to be done and it was done but not harshly always joined in the same report his eye were turned towards the door and lighted up as i entered
dear boy he said as i sat down by his bed i thought you was late but i knowed you couldnt be that
it is just the time said i i waited for it at the gate you always waits at the gate dont you dear boy
yes not to lose a moment of the time thank ee dear boy thank ee god bless you you ve never deserted me dear boy
i pressed his hand in silence for i could not forget that i had once meant to desert him
and what the best of all he said you ve been more comfortable alonger me since i was under a dark cloud than when the sun shone
do what he would and love me though he did the light left his face ever and again and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling
that best of all he lay on his back breathing with great difficulty are you in much pain to day
he smiled and i understood his touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand and lay it on his breast
i dont complain of none dear boy you never do complain he had spoken his last word i laid it there and he smiled again and put both his hand upon it
the allotted time ran out while we were thus but looking round i found the governor of the prison standing near me and he whispered you neednt go yet
i thanked him gratefully and asked might i speak to him if he can hear me the governor stepped aside and beckoned the officer away
the change though it was made without noise drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling and he looked most affectionately at me
dear abel_magwitch i must tell you now at last you understand what i say a gentle pressure on my hand
you had a child once whom you loved and lost a stronger pressure on my hand she lived and found powerful friend
with a last faint effort which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it he raised my hand to his lips
she is living now she is a lady and very beautiful and i love her then he gently let it sink upon his breast again with his own hand lying on it
mindful then of what we had read together i thought of the two man who went up into the temple to pray and i knew there were no better word that i could say beside his bed than lord be merciful to him a sinner
the placid look at the white ceiling came back and passed away and his head dropped quietly on his breast chapter lvii
now that i was left wholly to myself i gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine and in the meanwhile to underlet them
at once i put bills up in the window for i was in debt and had scarcely any money and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs
i ought rather to write that i should have been alarmed if i had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that i was falling very ill
the late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness but not to put it away i knew that it was coming on me now and i knew very little else and was even careless as to that
for a day or two i lay on the sofa or on the floor anywhere according as i happened to sink down with a heavy head and aching limbs and no purpose and no power
then there came one night which appeared of great duration and which teemed with anxiety and horror and when in the morning i tried to sit up in my bed and think of it i found i could not do so
whether i really had been down in garden court in the dead of the night groping about for the boat that i supposed to be there whether i had two or three time come to myself on the staircase with great terror not knowing how i had got out of bed whether i had found myself lighting the lamp possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs and that the light were blown out whether i had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking laughing and groaning of some one and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room and a voice had called out over and over again that miss_havisham was consuming within it these were thing that i tried to settle with myself and get into some order as i lay that morning on my bed
but the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them disordering them all and it was through the vapor at last that i saw two man looking at me
well sir returned one of them bending down and touching me on the shoulder this is a matter that you ll soon arrange i dare say but you re arrested
what do you want i asked starting i dont know you what is the debt hundred and twenty three pound fifteen six
jeweller account i think what is to be done you had better come to my house said the man
i keep a very nice house i made some attempt to get up and dress myself when i next attended to them they were standing a little off from the bed looking at me
i still lay there you see my state said i i would come with you if i could but indeed i am quite unable
perhaps they replied or argued the point or tried to encourage me to believe that i was better than i thought
if you take me from here i think i shall die by the way forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread
that i had a fever and was avoided that i suffered greatly that i often lost my reason that the time seemed interminable that i confounded impossible existences with my own identity that i was a brick in the house wall and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me that i was a steel beam of a vast engine clashing and whirling over a gulf and yet that i implored in my own person to have the engine stopped and my part in it hammered off that i passed through these phases of disease i know of my own remembrance and did in some sort know at the time
that i sometimes struggled with real people in the belief that they were murderers and that i would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good and would then sink exhausted in their arm and suffer them to lay me down i also knew at the time
i dont know what they did except that they forbore to remove me but above all i knew that there was a constant tendency in all these
people who when i was very ill would present all kind of extraordinary transformations of the human face and would be much dilated in size above all i say i knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people sooner or later to settle down into the likeness of mrs_joe_gargery
after i had turned the worst point of my illness i began to notice that while all its other features changed this one consistent feature did not change
whoever came about me still settled down into mrs_joe_gargery i opened my eye in the night and i saw in the great chair at the bedside mrs_joe_gargery
i opened my eye in the day and sitting on the window seat smoking his pipe in the shaded open window still i saw mrs_joe_gargery
i sank back on my pillow after drinking and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of mrs_joe_gargery
i asked for cooling drink and the dear hand that gave it me was mrs_joe_gargery at last one day i took courage and said is it mrs_joe_gargery
and the dear old home voice answered which it air old chap mrs_joe_gargery you break my heart look angry at me mrs_joe_gargery
for mrs_joe_gargery had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side and put his arm round my neck in his joy that i knew him
strike me mrs_joe_gargery tell me of my ingratitude dont be so good to me which dear old mr_pip old chap said mrs_joe_gargery you and me was ever friend
and when you re well enough to go out for a ride what larks after which mrs_joe_gargery withdrew to the window and stood with his back towards me wiping his eye
and as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him i lay there penitently whispering god bless him
mrs_joe_gargery eye were red when i next found him beside me but i was holding his hand and we both felt happy
o god bless this gentle christian man how long dear mrs_joe_gargery which you meantersay mr_pip how long have your illness lasted dear old chap
yes mrs_joe_gargery it the end of may mr_pip to morrow is the first of june and have you been here all that time dear mrs_joe_gargery
for as i says to biddy when the news of your being ill were brought by letter which it were brought by the post and being formerly single
he is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoe leather but wealth were not a object on his part and marriage were the great wish of his hart
pretty nigh old chap it is so delightful to hear you mrs_joe_gargery but i interrupt you in what you said to biddy
which it were said mrs_joe_gargery that how you might be amongst strangers and that how you and me having been ever friend a wisit at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble
and biddy her word were go to him without loss of time that said mrs_joe_gargery summing up with his judicial air were the word of biddy
in short i shouldnt greatly deceive you mrs_joe_gargery added after a little grave reflection if i represented to you that the word of that young woman were without a minute loss of time
there mrs_joe_gargery cut himself short and informed me that i was to be talked to in great moderation and that i was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent time whether i felt inclined for it or not and that i was to submit myself to all his orders
so i kissed his hand and lay quiet while he proceeded to indite a note to biddy with my love in it
as i lay in bed looking at him it made me in my weak state cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which he set about his letter
my bedstead divested of its curtains had been removed with me upon it into the sitting room as the airiest and largest and the carpet had been taken away and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day
at my own writing table pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles mrs_joe_gargery now sat down to his great work first choosing a pen from the pen tray as if it were a chest of large tools and tucking up his sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow bar or sledgehammer
it was necessary for mrs_joe_gargery to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow and to get his right leg well out behind him before he could begin and when he did begin he made every downstroke so slowly that it might have been six foot long while at every upstroke i could hear his pen spluttering extensively
he had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not and constantly dipped his pen into space and seemed quite satisfied with the result
occasionally he was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling block but on the whole he got on very well indeed and when he had signed his name and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers he got up and hovered about the table trying the effect of his performance from various point of view as it lay there with unbounded satisfaction
not to make mrs_joe_gargery uneasy by talking too much even if i had been able to talk much i deferred asking him about miss_havisham until next day
go to him biddy say without loss of time evidently biddy had taught mrs_joe_gargery to write he shook his head when i then asked him if she had recovered
why you see old chap said mrs_joe_gargery in a tone of remonstrance and by way of getting at it by degrees i wouldnt go so far as to say that for that a deal to say but she aint living mrs_joe_gargery
is she dead mrs_joe_gargery that nigher where it is said mrs_joe_gargery she aint living did she linger long mrs_joe_gargery
arter you was took ill pretty much about what you might call if you was put to it a week said mrs_joe_gargery still determined on my account to come at everything by degrees
well old chap said mrs_joe_gargery it do appear that she had settled the most of it which i meantersay tied it up on miss_estella
dear mrs_joe_gargery have you heard what becomes of her property but she had wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand
a day or two afore the accident leaving a cool four thousand to mr_matthew_pocket and why do you suppose above all thing
i am told by biddy that air the writing said mrs_joe_gargery repeating the legal turn as if it did him infinite good account of him the said mr_matthew_pocket
mr_pip she left that cool four thousand unto him because of mr_pip account of him the said mr_matthew_pocket and a cool four thousand mr_pip
i never discovered from whom mrs_joe_gargery derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds but it appeared to make the sum of money more to him and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool
this account gave me great joy as it perfected the only good thing i had done i asked mrs_joe_gargery whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies
miss_sarah_pocket said mrs_joe_gargery she have twenty five pound perannium fur to buy pills on account of being bilious miss_georgiana she have twenty pound down
mrs what the name of them wild beasts with humps old chap camels said i wondering why he could possibly want to know
mrs camels by which i presently understood he meant mrs_camilla she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in spirits when she wake up in the night
mrs_joe_gargery nodded the accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me to give me great confidence in mrs_joe_gargery information
and now said mrs_joe_gargery you aint that strong yet old chap that you can take in more nor one additional shovelful to day
not i grant you but what his manner is given to blusterous said mrs_joe_gargery apologetically still a englishman ouse is his castle and castles must not be busted cept when done in war time
old_orlick he been a bustin open a dwelling ouse whose said i and wotsume er the failings on his part he were a corn and seedsman in his hart
that it mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery and they took his till and they took his cash box and they drinked his wine and they partook of his wittles and they slapped his face and they pulled his nose and they tied him up to his bedpust and they giv him a dozen and they stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out
is it mr_pumblechook house that has been broken into then but he knowed old_orlick and old_orlick in the county jail
i was slow to gain strength but i did slowly and surely become less weak and mrs_joe_gargery stayed with me and i fancied i was little mr_pip again
for the tenderness of mrs_joe_gargery was so beautifully proportioned to my need that i was like a child in his hand
he would sit and talk to me in the old confidence and with the old simplicity and in the old unassertive protecting way so that i would half believe that all my life since the day of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone
he did everything for me except the household work for which he had engaged a very decent woman after paying off the laundress on his first arrival
which i do assure you mr_pip he would often say in explanation of that liberty i found her a tapping the spare bed like a cask of beer and drawing off the feathers in a bucket for sale
which she would have tapped yourn next and draw it off with you a laying on it and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the soup tureen and wegetable dishes and the wine and spirits in your wellington boots
we looked forward to the day when i should go out for a ride as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship
and when the day came and an open carriage was got into the lane mrs_joe_gargery wrapped me up took me in his arm carried me down to it and put me in as if i were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature
and mrs_joe_gargery got in beside me and we drove away together into the country where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass and sweet summer scents filled all the air
the day happened to be sunday and when i looked on the loveliness around me and thought how it had grown and changed and how the little wild flowers had been forming and the voice of the birds had been strengthening by day and by night under the sun and under the stars
while poor i lay burning and tossing on my bed the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace
but when i heard the sunday bells and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty i felt that i was not nearly thankful
by these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation enough that i was too weak yet to be even that and
i laid my head on mrs_joe_gargery shoulder as i had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the fair or where not and it was too much for my young senses
more composure came to me after a while and we talked as we used to talk lying on the grass at the old battery
exactly what he had been in my eye then he was in my eye still just as simply faithful and as simply right
there was no change whatever in mrs_joe_gargery when we got back again and he lifted me out and carried me so easily across
the court and up the stairs i thought of that eventful christmas day when he had carried me over the marsh
we had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune nor did i know how much of my late history he was acquainted with
i was so doubtful of myself now and put so much trust in him that i could not satisfy myself whether i ought to refer to it when he did not
have you heard mrs_joe_gargery i asked him that evening upon further consideration as he smoked his pipe at the window who my patron was
i heerd returned mrs_joe_gargery as it were not miss_havisham old chap did you hear who it was mrs_joe_gargery
well i heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv you the bank notes at the jolly_bargemen mr_pip
so it was astonishing said mrs_joe_gargery in the placidest way did you hear that he was dead mrs_joe_gargery
i think said mrs_joe_gargery after meditating a long time and looking rather evasively at the window seat as i did hear tell that how he were something or another in a general way in that direction
i presently asked with increasing diffidence which him as sent the bank notes mr_pip yes did you hear anything of his circumstance mrs_joe_gargery
not partickler mr_pip if you would like to hear mrs_joe_gargery i was beginning when mrs_joe_gargery got up and came to my sofa
lookee here old chap said mrs_joe_gargery bending over me ever the best of friend aint us mr_pip i was ashamed to answer him
wery good then said mrs_joe_gargery as if i had answered that all right that agreed upon then why go into subject old chap which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary
there subject enough as betwixt two sech without onnecessary one lord to think of your poor sister and her rampages and dont you remember tickler
i done what i could to keep you and tickler in sunders but my power were not always fully equal to my inclinations
for when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you it were not so much said mrs_joe_gargery in his favorite argumentative way that she dropped into me too if i put myself in opposition to her but that she dropped into you always heavier for it
it aint a grab at a man whisker not yet a shake or two of a man to which your sister was quite welcome that ud put a man off from getting a little child out of punishment
but when that little child is dropped into heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking then that man naterally up and says to himself where is the good as you are a doing
i do indeed mrs_joe_gargery lookee here old chap said mrs_joe_gargery i noticed that i grant you i see the arm says the man but i dont see the good
i call upon you sir therefore to pint out the good the man says i observed as mrs_joe_gargery waited for me to speak
the man says mrs_joe_gargery assented is he right that man dear mrs_joe_gargery he is always right well old chap said mrs_joe_gargery then abide by your word
if he always right which in general he more likely wrong he right when he says this supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself when you was a little child you kep it mostly because you know as mrs_joe_gargery power to part you and tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his inclinations
theerfore think no more of it as betwixt two sech and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subject biddy giv herself a deal trouble with me afore
i left for i am almost awful dull as i should view it in this light and viewing it in this light as i should so put it
both of which said mrs_joe_gargery quite charmed with his logical arrangement being done now this to you a true friend say
you mustnt go a overdoing on it but you must have your supper and your wine and water and you must be put betwixt the sheets
the delicacy with which mrs_joe_gargery dismissed this theme and the sweet tact and kindness with which biddy who with her woman wit had found me out so soon had prepared him for it made a deep impression on my mind
but whether mrs_joe_gargery knew how poor i was and how my great expectations had all dissolved like our own marsh mists before the sun i could not understand
another thing in mrs_joe_gargery that i could not understand when it first began to develop itself but which i soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of was this as i became stronger and better mrs_joe_gargery became a little less easy with me
in my weakness and entire dependence on him the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone and called me by the old name the dear old mr_pip old chap that now were music in my ears
but imperceptibly though i held by them fast mrs_joe_gargery hold upon them began to slacken and whereas i wondered at this at first i soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me and that the fault of it was all mine
had i given mrs_joe_gargery no reason to doubt my constancy and to think that in prosperity i should grow cold to him and cast him off
namely i too had fallen into the old way only happy and thankful that he let me ah had i given mrs_joe_gargery innocent heart
no cause to feel instinctively that as i got stronger his hold upon me would be weaker and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go before i plucked myself away
it was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the temple gardens leaning on mrs_joe_gargery arm that i saw this change in him very plainly
we had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight looking at the river and i chanced to say as we got up
see mrs_joe_gargery i can walk quite strongly now you shall see me walk back by myself which do not overdo it mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery
but i shall be happy fur to see you able sir the last word grated on me but how could i remonstrate
i walked no further than the gate of the gardens and then pretended to be weaker than i was and asked mrs_joe_gargery for his arm
i for my part was thoughtful too for how best to check this growing change in mrs_joe_gargery was a great perplexity to my remorseful thought
that i was ashamed to tell him exactly how i was placed and what i had come down to i do not seek to conceal but i hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one
he would want to help me out of his little savings i knew and i knew that he ought not to help me and that i must not suffer him to do it
mrs_joe_gargery gave it me but was thoughtful it was a thoughtful evening with both of us but before we went to bed i had resolved that i would wait over to morrow to morrow being sunday and
on monday morning i would speak to mrs_joe_gargery about this change i would lay aside this last vestige of reserve i would tell him what i had in my thought that secondly not yet arrived at and why i had not decided to go out to herbert_pocket and then the change would be conquered for ever
would begin my new course with the new week as i cleared mrs_joe_gargery cleared and it seemed as though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too
we had a quiet day on the sunday and we rode out into the country and then walked in the fields
i feel thankful that i have been ill mrs_joe_gargery i said dear old mr_pip old chap you re a most come round sir
it has been a memorable time for me mrs_joe_gargery likeways for myself sir mrs_joe_gargery returned we have had a time together mrs_joe_gargery that i can never forget
there were day once i know that i did for a while forget but i never shall forget these mr_pip said mrs_joe_gargery appearing a little hurried and troubled there has been larks
at night when i had gone to bed mrs_joe_gargery came into my room as he had done all through my recovery
and dear sir what have been betwixt us have been he asked me if i felt sure that i was as well as in the morning
mrs_joe_gargery patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand and said in what i thought a husky voice good night
when i got up in the morning refreshed and stronger yet i was full of my resolution to tell mrs_joe_gargery all without delay
yes dear mrs_joe_gargery quite and are always a getting stronger old chap yes dear mrs_joe_gargery steadily i would tell him before breakfast
i would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him for it was the first day i had been up early
i went to his room and he was not there not only was he not there but his box was gone
i hurried then to the breakfast table and on it found a letter these were its brief contents not wishful to intrude i have departured fur
you are well again dear mr_pip and will do better without jo s ever the best of friend enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which i had been arrested
down to that moment i had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn or suspended proceedings until i should be quite recovered
i had never dreamed of mrs_joe_gargery having paid the money but mrs_joe_gargery had paid it and the receipt was in his name
what remained for me now but to follow him to the dear old forge and there to have out my disclosure to him and my penitent remonstrance with him and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved secondly which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thought and had formed into a settled purpose
the purpose was that i would go to biddy that i would show her how humbled and repentant i came back that i would tell her how i had lost all i once hoped for that i would remind her of our old confidences in my first unhappy time
biddy i think you once liked me very well when my errant heart even while it strayed away from you was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since
if you can like me only half as well once more if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head if you can receive me like a forgiven child and indeed i am as sorry biddy and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand i hope i am a little worthier of you that i was not much but a little
and biddy it shall rest with you to say whether i shall work at the forge with mrs_joe_gargery or whether i shall try for any different occupation down in this country or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which i set aside when it was offered until i knew your answer
and now dear biddy if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me you will surely make it a better world for me and me a better man for it and i will try hard to make it a better world for you
then i would say to her such was my purpose after three day more of recovery i went down to the old place to put it in execution
the tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my native place and its neighborhood before i got there
i found the blue_boar in possession of the intelligence and i found that it made a great change in the boar demeanour
whereas the boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when i was coming into property the boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that i was going out of property
and how i sped in it is all i have left to tell chapter lviii it was evening when i arrived much fatigued by the journey i had so often made so easily
the boar could not put me into my usual bedroom which was engaged probably by some one who had expectations and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and post chaises up the yard
but i had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the boar could have given me and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom
there were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the window announcing a sale by auction of the household furniture and effects next week
early in the morning while my breakfast was getting ready i strolled round by satis house the house itself was to be sold as old building materials and pulled down
lot was marked in whitewashed knock knee letters on the brew house lot on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up
other lots were marked off on other part of the structure and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already
stepping in for a moment at the open gate and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there i saw the auctioneer clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue compiler pen in hand who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair i had so often pushed along to the tune of old clem
mr_pumblechook not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure was waiting for me and addressed me in the following terms
when i got back to my breakfast in the boar coffee room i found mr_pumblechook conversing with the landlord young man i am sorry to see you brought low
as he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air and as i was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel i took it
but what else could be expected what else could be expected william said mr_pumblechook to the waiter put a muffin on table
mr_pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea before i could touch the teapot with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last
and has it come to this has it come to this i frowningly sat down to my breakfast william said mr_pumblechook mournfully put the salt on
in happier time addressing me i think you took sugar and did you take milk you did sugar and milk william bring a watercress
you dont eat em returned mr_pumblechook sighing and nodding his head several time as if he might have expected that and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall
thank you said i shortly but i dont eat watercresses true the simple fruits of the earth no you neednt bring any william
i went on with my breakfast and mr_pumblechook continued to stand over me staring fishily and breathing noisily as he always did
and yet when he went from here i may say with my blessing and i spread afore him my humble store like the bee he was as plump as a peach
this reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity saying may i and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five finger
little more than skin and bone mused mr_pumblechook aloud hah he went on handing me the bread and butter
and air you a going to joseph_gargery in heaven name said i firing in spite of myself what does it matter to you where i am going
leave that teapot alone it was the worst course i could have taken because it gave mr_pumblechook the opportunity he wanted
yes young man said he releasing the handle of the article in question retiring a step or two from my table and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door i will leave that teapot alone
i forgit myself when i take such an interest in your breakfast as to wish your frame exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality to be stimilated by the olesome nourishment of your forefathers
and yet said mr_pumblechook turning to the landlord and waiter and pointing me out at arm length this is him as i ever sported with in his day of happy infancy
you are right young man for once you are right tell me not it cannot be i tell you this is him
a low murmur from the two replied the waiter appeared to be particularly affected this is him said mr_pumblechook as i have rode in my shay cart
this is him untoe the sister of which i was uncle by marriage as her name was miss_georgiana ria from her own mother let him deny it if he can
this is him as i have seen brought up by hand the waiter seemed convinced that i could not deny it and that it gave the case a black look
young man said mr_pumblechook screwing his head at me in the old fashion you air a going to joseph_gargery what does it matter to me you ask me where you air a going
i say to you sir you air a going to joseph_gargery the waiter coughed as if he modestly invited me to get over that
now said mr_pumblechook and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive i will tell you what to say to joseph_gargery
here is squires of the boar present known and respected in this town and here is william which his father name was potkins if i do not deceive myself
you do not sir said william in their presence pursued mr_pumblechook i will tell you young man what to say to joseph_gargery
i will name no name joseph_gargery but so they are pleased to call him up town and i have seen that man
says you joseph_gargery i have this day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun i swear i dont see him here said i say that likewise retorted mr_pumblechook
say you said that and even joseph_gargery will probably betray surprise there you quite mistake him said i i know better
says you mr_pumblechook went on joseph_gargery i have seen that man and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice
he knows your character joseph_gargery and is well acquainted with your pig headedness and ignorance and he knows my character joseph_gargery and he knows my want of gratitoode
yes joseph_gargery says you here mr_pumblechook shook his head and hand at me he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode
he knows it joseph_gargery as none can you do not know it joseph_gargery having no call to know it but that man do
windy donkey as he was it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine
says you joseph_gargery he gave me a little message which i will now repeat it was that in my being brought low he saw the finger of providence
he knowed that finger when he saw joseph_gargery and he saw it plain it pinted out this writing joseph_gargery reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor and founder of fortun
it was right to do it it was kind to do it it was benevolent to do it and he would do it again
it pity said i scornfully as i finished my interrupted breakfast that the man did not say what he had done and would do again
but that man said he did not repent of what he had done joseph_gargery not at all squires of the boar
i have no objections to your mentioning either up town or down town if such should be your wishes that it was right to do it kind to do it benevolent to do it and that i would do it again
with those word the impostor shook them both by the hand with an air and left the house leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite it
i was not long after him in leaving the house too and when i went down the high street i saw him holding forth no doubt to the same effect at his shop door to a select group who honored me with very unfavorable glances as i passed on the opposite side of the way
but it was only the pleasanter to turn to biddy and to mrs_joe_gargery whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before if that could be contrasted with this brazen pretender
i went towards them slowly for my limbs were weak but with a sense of increasing relief as i drew nearer to them and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind
the sky was blue the larks were soaring high over the green corn i thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than i had ever known it to be yet
many pleasant pictures of the life that i would lead there and of the change for the better that would come over my character when i had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom
mr_pumblechook was now addressing the landlord and william the june weather was delicious i had proved beguiled my way
they awakened a tender emotion in me for my heart was softened by my return and such a change had come to pass that i felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel and whose wanderings had lasted many year
the schoolhouse where biddy was mistress i had never seen but the little roundabout lane by which i entered the village for quietness sake took me past it
some hopeful notion of seeing her busily engaged in her daily duties before she saw me had been in my mind and was defeated
but the forge was a very short distance off and i went towards it under the sweet green limes listening for the clink of mrs_joe_gargery hammer
long after i ought to have heard it and long after i had fancied i heard it and found it but a fancy all was still
the limes were there and the white thorns were there and the chestnut trees were there and their leaves rustled harmoniously when i stopped to listen but the clink of mrs_joe_gargery hammer was not in the midsummer wind
almost fearing without knowing why to come in view of the forge i saw it at last and saw that it was closed
i was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday no child were there and biddy house was closed no gleam of fire no glittering shower of sparks no roar of bellows all shut up and still
but the house was not deserted and the best parlor seemed to be in use for there were white curtains fluttering in its window and the window was open and gay with flowers
i went softly towards it meaning to peep over the flowers when mrs_joe_gargery and biddy stood before me arm in arm
at first biddy gave a cry as if she thought it was my apparition but in another moment she was in my embrace
i wept to see her and she wept to see me i because she looked so fresh and pleasant she because i looked so worn and white
but dear biddy how smart you are yes dear mr_pip and mrs_joe_gargery how smart you are yes dear old mr_pip old chap
i looked at both of them from one to the other and then it my wedding day cried biddy in a burst of happiness and i am married to mrs_joe_gargery
they had taken me into the kitchen and i had laid my head down on the old deal table biddy held one of my hand to her lips and mrs_joe_gargery restoring touch was on my shoulder
which he warnt strong enough my dear fur to be surprised said mrs_joe_gargery and biddy said i ought to have thought of it dear mrs_joe_gargery but i was too happy
they were both so overjoyed to see me so proud to see me so touched by my coming to them so delighted that i should have come by accident to make their day complete
my first thought was one of great thankfulness that i had never breathed this last baffled hope to mrs_joe_gargery how often while he was with me in my illness had it risen to my lips
dear biddy said i you have the best husband in the whole world and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have
how irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it if he had remained with me but another hour but no you couldnt love him better than you do
and dear mrs_joe_gargery you have the best wife in the whole world and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be you dear good noble mrs_joe_gargery
no i couldnt indeed said biddy mrs_joe_gargery looked at me with a quivering lip and fairly put his sleeve before his eye
and mrs_joe_gargery and biddy both as you have been to church to day and are in charity and love with all mankind receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me and all i have so ill repaid
and when i say that i am going away within the hour for i am soon going abroad and that i shall never rest until i have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison and have sent it to you dont think dear mrs_joe_gargery and biddy that if i could repay it a thousand time over i suppose i could cancel a farthing of the debt i owe you or that i would do so if i could
they were both melted by these word and both entreated me to say no more but i must say more
dear mrs_joe_gargery i hope you will have child to love and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney corner of a winter night who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever
dont tell him biddy that i was ungenerous and unjust only tell him that i honored you both because you were both so good and true and that as your child i said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than i did
dont tell him mrs_joe_gargery that i was thankless i aint a going said mrs_joe_gargery from behind his sleeve to tell him nothink that natur mr_pip
and now though i know you have already done it in your own kind heart pray tell me both that you forgive me
pray let me hear you say the word that i may carry the sound of them away with me and then i shall be able to believe that you can trust me and think better of me in the time to come
nor biddy aint nor yet no one aint dear old mr_pip old chap said mrs_joe_gargery god knows as i forgive you if i have anythink to forgive
amen and god knows i do echoed biddy now let me go up and look at my old little room and rest there a few minutes by myself
and then when i have eaten and drunk with you go with me as far as the finger post dear mrs_joe_gargery and biddy before we say good bye
i sold all i had and put aside as much as i could for a composition with my creditors who gave me ample time to pay them in
within a month i had quitted england and within two months i was clerk to clarriker and co and within four months i assumed my first undivided responsibility
for the beam across the parlor ceiling at mill pond bank had then ceased to tremble under old bill_barley growls and was at peace and herbert_pocket had gone away to marry clara and i was left in sole charge of the eastern branch until he brought her back
many a year went round before i was a partner in the house but i lived happily with herbert_pocket and his wife and lived frugally and paid my debts and maintained a constant correspondence with biddy and mrs_joe_gargery
it was not until i became third in the firm that clarriker betrayed me to herbert_pocket but he then declared that the secret of herbert_pocket partnership had been long enough upon his conscience and he must tell it
full and i went out and joined herbert_pocket so he told it and herbert_pocket was as much moved as amazed and the dear fellow
i must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great house or that we made mints of money
we were not in a grand way of business but we had a good name and worked for our profits and did very well
we owed so much to herbert_pocket ever cheerful industry and readiness that i often wondered how i had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude until i was one day enlightened by the reflection that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all but had been in me
and i were not the worse friend for the long concealment chapter lix for eleven year i had not seen mrs_joe_gargery nor biddy with my bodily eye though
they had both been often before my fancy in the east when upon an evening in december an hour or two after dark
i laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door i touched it so softly that i was not heard and looked in unseen
there smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight as hale and as strong as ever though a little gray sat mrs_joe_gargery and there fenced into the corner with mrs_joe_gargery leg and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire was i again
we giv him the name of mr_pip for your sake dear old chap said mrs_joe_gargery delighted when i took another stool by the child side but
i did not rumple his hair and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you and we think he do
i thought so too and i took him out for a walk next morning and we talked immensely understanding one another to perfection
and i took him down to the churchyard and set him on a certain tombstone there and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of philip pirrip late of this parish and also miss_georgiana wife of the above
biddy said i when i talked with her after dinner as her little girl lay sleeping in her lap you must give mr_pip to me one of these day or lend him at all events
no no said biddy gently you must marry so herbert_pocket and clara say but i dont think i shall biddy
i have so settled down in their home that it not at all likely i am already quite an old bachelor
biddy looked down at her child and put its little hand to her lips and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine
there was something in the action and in the light pressure of biddy wedding ring that had a very pretty eloquence in it
dear mr_pip said biddy you are sure you dont fret for her no i think not biddy tell me as an old old friend
my dear biddy i have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there and little that ever had any place there
have you quite forgotten her but that poor dream as i once used to call it has all gone by biddy all gone by
nevertheless i knew while i said those word that i secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening alone for her sake
i had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life and as being separated from her husband who had used her with great cruelty and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride avarice brutality and meanness
yes even so for miss_estella sake and i had heard of the death of her husband from an accident consequent on his ill treatment of a horse
the early dinner hour at mrs_joe_gargery left me abundance of time without hurrying my talk with biddy to walk over to the old spot before dark
but what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think of old time the day had quite declined when i came to the place
this release had befallen her some two year before for anything i knew she was married again there was no house now no brewery no building whatever left but the wall of the old garden
the cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence and looking over it i saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin
a gate in the fence standing ajar i pushed it open and went in a cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon and the moon was not yet up to scatter it
i could trace out where every part of the old house had been and where the brewery had been and where the gate and where the casks
but the stars were shining beyond the mist and the moon was coming and the evening was not dark i had done so and was looking along the desolate garden walk when i beheld a solitary figure in it
the figure showed itself aware of me as i advanced it had been moving towards me but it stood still as i drew nearer i saw it to be the figure of a woman
as i drew nearer yet it was about to turn away when it stopped and let me come up with it
then it faltered as if much surprised and uttered my name and i cried out miss_estella i am greatly changed i wonder you know me
those attractions in it i had seen before what i had never seen before was the saddened softened light of the once proud eye what i had never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand
we sat down on a bench that was near and i said after so many year it is strange that we should thus meet again miss_estella here where our first meeting was
the freshness of her beauty was indeed gone but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained do you often come back
nor i the moon began to rise and i thought of the placid look at the white ceiling which had passed away
the moon began to rise and i thought of the pressure on my hand when i had spoken the last word he had heard on earth
i have never been here since miss_estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us i have very often hoped and intended to come back but have been prevented by many circumstance
the silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eye
not knowing that i saw them and setting herself to get the better of them she said quietly were you wondering as you walked along how it came to be left in this condition
poor poor old place yes miss_estella the ground belongs to me it is the only possession i have not relinquished
everything else has gone from me little by little but i have kept this it was the subject of the only determined resistance i made in all the wretched year
is it to be built on at last it is i came here to take leave of it before its change
and you she said in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer you live abroad still still and do well i am sure
i work pretty hard for a sufficient living and therefore yes i do well i have often thought of you said miss_estella
there was a long hard time when i kept far from me the remembrance of what i had thrown away when i was quite ignorant of its worth
but since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance i have given it a place in my heart
have you of late very often you have always held your place in my heart i answered and we were silent again until she spoke
i little thought said miss_estella that i should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot i am very glad to do so
glad to part again miss_estella to me parting is a painful thing to me the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful
and if you could say that to me then you will not hesitate to say that to me now now when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be
but you said to me returned miss_estella very earnestly god bless you god forgive you i have been bent and broken
but i hope into a better shape be as considerate and good to me as you were and tell me we are friend
we are friend said i rising and bending over her as she rose from the bench and will continue friend apart said miss_estella
i took her hand in mine and we went out of the ruined place and as the morning mists had risen long ago when i first left the forge so the evening mists were rising now and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me i saw no shadow of another parting from her
