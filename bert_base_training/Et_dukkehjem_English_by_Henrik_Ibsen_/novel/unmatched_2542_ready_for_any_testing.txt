nils_krogstad torvald_helmer three young child anne their nurse a housemaid a porter the action takes place in torvald_helmer house a doll house act i scene a room furnished comfortably and tastefully but not extravagantly
at the back a door to the right leads to the entrance hall another to the left leads to torvald_helmer study between the door stands a piano
in the middle of the left hand wall is a door and beyond it a window near the window are a round table arm chairs and a small sofa
in the right hand wall at the farther end another door and on the same side nearer the footlights a stove two easy chairs and a rocking chair between the stove and the door a small table
engravings on the walls a cabinet with china and other small objects a small book case with well bound books the floors are carpeted and a fire burns in the stove
it is winter a bell rings in the hall shortly afterwards the door is heard to open enter nora humming a tune and in high spirits
she leaves the outer door open after her and through it is seen a porter who is carrying a christmas tree and a basket which he gives to the maid who has opened the door
she is in outdoor dress and carries a number of parcels these she lays on the table to the right nora
hide the christmas tree carefully helen be sure the child do not see it until this evening when it is dressed
to the porter taking out her purse how much porter sixpence nora there is a shilling no keep the change the porter thanks her and goes out
she takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two then goes cautiously to her husband door and listens
nora shuts the door she is laughing to herself as she takes off her hat and coat yes he is in
still humming she goes to the table on the right torvald_helmer calls out from his room is that my little lark twittering out there
nora busy opening some of the parcels yes it is torvald_helmer is it my little squirrel bustling about nora yes torvald_helmer
when did my squirrel come home nora just now puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her mouth
come in here torvald_helmer and see what i have bought torvald_helmer dont disturb me a little later he opens the door and looks into the room pen in hand
bought did you say all these thing has my little spendthrift been wasting money again nora yes but torvald_helmer this year we really can let ourselves go a little
this is the first christmas that we have not needed to economise torvald_helmer still you know we cant spend money recklessly
nora yes torvald_helmer we may be a wee bit more reckless now maynt we just a tiny wee bit you are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots of money
torvald_helmer yes after the new year but then it will be a whole quarter before the salary is due nora pooh
we can borrow until then torvald_helmer nora goes up to her and takes her playfully by the ear the same little featherhead
suppose now that i borrowed fifty pounds today and you spent it all in the christmas week and then on new year eve a slate fell on my head and killed me and
nora putting her hands over his mouth oh dont say such horrid thing torvald_helmer still suppose that happened what then nora if that were to happen i dont suppose i should care whether i owed money or not
torvald_helmer yes but what about the people who had lent it nora they who would bother about them i should not know who they were
torvald_helmer that is like a woman but seriously nora you know what i think about that no debt no borrowing there can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt
we two have kept bravely on the straight road so far and we will go on the same way for the short time longer that there need be any struggle
nora moving towards the stove as you please torvald_helmer following her come come my little skylark must not droop her wings
what is this is my little squirrel out of temper taking out his purse nora what do you think i have got here
nora turning round quickly money torvald_helmer there you are gives her some money do you think i dont know what a lot is wanted for housekeeping at christmas time
nora counting ten shillings a pound two pounds thank you thank you torvald_helmer that will keep me going for a long time torvald_helmer
indeed it must nora yes yes it will but come here and let me show you what i have bought and all so cheap
a sword and a horse and a trumpet for bob and a doll and dolly bedstead for emmy they are very plain but anyway she will soon break them in pieces
look here is a new suit for ivar and and here are dress lengths and handkerchiefs for the maids old anne ought really to have something better
torvald_helmer and what is in this parcel nora crying out no no you mustnt see that until this evening torvald_helmer very well
but now tell me you extravagant little person what would you like for yourself nora for myself oh i am sure i dont want anything
torvald_helmer yes but you must tell me something reasonable that you would particularly like to have nora no i really cant think of anything unless torvald_helmer
well nora playing with his coat buttons and without raising her eyes to his if you really want to give me something you might you might torvald_helmer
well out with it nora speaking quickly you might give me money torvald_helmer only just as much as you can afford and then one of these days i will buy something with it
torvald_helmer but nora nora oh do dear torvald_helmer please please do then i will wrap it up in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the christmas tree
let us do as you suggest torvald_helmer and then i shall have time to think what i am most in want of
wouldnt that be fun torvald_helmer what are little people called that are always wasting money nora spendthrifts i know that is a very sensible plan isnt it
indeed it is that is to say if you were really to save out of the money i give you and then really buy something for yourself
but if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of unnecessary thing then i merely have to pay up again
torvald_helmer smiling nora oh but torvald_helmer you cant deny it my dear little nora puts his arm round her waist
it a sweet little spendthrift but she uses up a deal of money one would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are
nora it a shame to say that i do really save all i can torvald_helmer laughing that very true all you can
but you cant save anything nora smiling quietly and happily you havent any idea how many expenses we skylarks and squirrels have torvald_helmer
you always find some new way of wheedling money out of me and as soon as you have got it it seems to melt in your hands
torvald_helmer you are an odd little soul very like your father you never know where it has gone still one must take you as you are
it is in the blood for indeed it is true that you can inherit these thing nora nora ah i wish i had inherited many of papa qualities
torvald_helmer and i would not wish you to be anything but just what you are my sweet little skylark but do you know it strikes me that you are looking rather what shall i say rather uneasy today
nora do i torvald_helmer you do really look straight at me nora looks at him well torvald_helmer wagging his finger at her
hasnt miss sweet tooth been breaking rules in town today nora no what makes you think that torvald_helmer hasnt she paid a visit to the confectioner
nora no i assure you torvald_helmer not been nibbling sweets nora no certainly not torvald_helmer not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two
nora no torvald_helmer i assure you really torvald_helmer there there of course i was only joking nora going to the table on the right
i should not think of going against your wishes torvald_helmer no i am sure of that besides you gave me your word going up to her
keep your little christmas secrets to yourself my darling they will all be revealed tonight when the christmas tree is lit no doubt
nora did you remember to invite doctor rank torvald_helmer no but there is no need as a matter of course he will come to dinner with us
however i will ask him when he comes in this morning i have ordered some good wine nora you cant think how i am looking forward to this evening
nora so am i and how the child will enjoy themselves torvald_helmer it is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safe appointment and a big enough income
for a full three weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight making ornaments for the christmas tree and all the other fine thing that were to be a surprise to us
it delightful to think of isnt it nora it wonderful torvald_helmer do you remember last christmas it was the dullest three weeks i ever spent
nora i didnt find it dull torvald_helmer smiling but there was precious little result nora nora oh you shouldnt tease me about that again
how could i help the cat going in and tearing everything to pieces torvald_helmer of course you couldnt poor little girl
you had the best of intentions to please us all and that the main thing but it is a good thing that our hard time are over
this time i neednt sit here and be dull all alone and you neednt ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands nora clapping her hands
nora yes it is really wonderful torvald_helmer no torvald_helmer i neednt any longer need i it wonderfully lovely to hear you say so
taking his arm now i will tell you how i have been thinking we ought to arrange thing torvald_helmer as soon as christmas is over a bell rings in the hall
there the bell she tidies the room a little there some one at the door what a nuisance torvald_helmer if it is a caller remember i am not at home
maid in the doorway a lady to see you ma am a stranger nora ask her to come in maid to torvald_helmer the doctor came at the same time sir
torvald_helmer did he go straight into my room maid yes sir torvald_helmer goes into his room the maid ushers in mrs_linde who is in travelling dress and shuts the door
mrs_linde in a dejected and timid voice how do you do nora nora doubtfully how do you do mrs_linde you dont recognise me i suppose
nora no i dont know yes to be sure i seem to suddenly yes christine is it really you mrs_linde yes it is i nora
christine to think of my not recognising you and yet how could i in a gentle voice how you have altered christine
mrs_linde yes i have indeed in nine ten long years nora is it so long since we met i suppose it is
the last eight years have been a happy time for me i can tell you and so now you have come into the town and have taken this long journey in winter
that was plucky of you mrs_linde i arrived by steamer this morning nora to have some fun at christmas time of course
how delightful we will have such fun together but take off your thing you are not cold i hope helps her
now we will sit down by the stove and be cosy no take this armchair i will sit here in the rocking chair
takes her hands now you look like your old self again it was only the first moment you are a little paler christine and perhaps a little thinner
mrs_linde and much much older nora nora perhaps a little older very very little certainly not much stops suddenly and speaks seriously
what a thoughtless creature i am chattering away like this my poor dear christine do forgive me mrs_linde what do you mean nora
nora gently poor christine you are a widow mrs_linde yes it is three years ago now nora yes i knew i saw it in the papers
i assure you christine i meant ever so often to write to you at the time but i always put it off and something always prevented me
mrs_linde i quite understand dear nora it was very bad of me christine poor thing how you must have suffered
and he left you nothing mrs_linde no nora and no child mrs_linde no nora nothing at all then mrs_linde
not even any sorrow or grief to live upon nora looking incredulously at her but christine is that possible mrs_linde smiles sadly and strokes her hair
it sometimes happens nora nora so you are quite alone how dreadfully sad that must be i have three lovely child
you cant see them just now for they are out with their nurse but now you must tell me all about it
mrs_linde no no i want to hear about you nora no you must begin i mustnt be selfish today today i must only think of your affairs
but there is one thing i must tell you do you know we have just had a great piece of good luck
mrs_linde no what is it nora just fancy my husband has been made manager of the bank mrs_linde your husband
a barrister profession is such an uncertain thing especially if he wont undertake unsavoury cases and naturally torvald_helmer has never been willing to do that and i quite agree with him
he is to take up his work in the bank at the new year and then he will have a big salary and lots of commissions
what good luck nora yes tremendous you may imagine how pleased we are for the future we can live quite differently we can do just as we like
i feel so relieved and so happy christine it will be splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety wont it
mrs_linde yes anyhow i think it would be delightful to have what one needs nora no not only what one needs but heaps and heaps of money
mrs_linde smiling nora nora havent you learned sense yet in our schooldays you were a great spendthrift nora laughing yes that is what torvald_helmer says now
wags her finger at her but nora nora is not so silly as you think we have not been in a position for me to waste money
we have both had to work mrs_linde you too nora yes odds and ends needlework crotchet work embroidery and that kind of thing
dropping her voice and other thing as well you know torvald_helmer left his office when we were married there was no prospect of promotion there and he had to try and earn more than before
you see he had to make money every way he could and he worked early and late but he couldnt stand it and fell dreadfully ill and the doctors said it was necessary for him to go south
but during the first year he over worked himself dreadfully mrs_linde you spent a whole year in italy didnt you nora
yes it was no easy matter to get away i can tell you it was just after ivar was born but naturally we had to go
it was a wonderfully beautiful journey and it saved torvald_helmer life but it cost a tremendous lot of money christine mrs_linde
so i should think nora it cost about two hundred and fifty pounds that a lot isnt it mrs_linde yes and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have the money
nora i ought to tell you that we had it from papa mrs_linde oh i see it was just about that time that he died wasnt it
nora yes and just think of it i couldnt go and nurse him i was expecting little ivar birth every day
and i had my poor sick torvald_helmer to look after my dear kind father i never saw him again christine that was the saddest time i have known since our marriage
mrs_linde i know how fond you were of him and then you went off to italy nora yes you see we had money then and the doctors insisted on our going so we started a month later
mrs_linde and your husband came back quite well nora as sound as a bell mrs_linde but the doctor nora what doctor
mrs_linde i thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here just as i did was the doctor nora yes that was doctor rank but he doesnt come here professionally
no torvald_helmer has not had an hour illness since then and our child are strong and healthy and so am i
he is our greatest friend and comes in at least once every day jumps up and claps her hands christine christine
it good to be alive and happy but how horrid of me i am talking of nothing but my own affairs sits on a stool near her and rests her arms on her knees
you mustnt be angry with me tell me is it really true that you did not love your husband why did you marry him
my mother was alive then and was bedridden and helpless and i had to provide for my two younger brothers so i did not think i was justified in refusing his offer
mrs_linde nora no perhaps you were quite right he was rich at that time then mrs_linde i believe he was quite well off
but his business was a precarious one and when he died it all went to pieces and there was nothing left
well i had to turn my hand to anything i could find first a small shop then a small school and so on
nora and then mrs_linde the last three years have seemed like one long working day with no rest now it is at an end nora
my poor mother needs me no more for she is gone and the boys do not need me either they have got situations and can shift for themselves
nora what a relief you must feel if mrs_linde no indeed i only feel my life unspeakably empty no one to live for anymore
gets up restlessly that was why i could not stand the life in my little backwater any longer i hope it may be easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts
if only i could have the good luck to get some regular work office work of some kind nora but christine that is so frightfully tiring and you look tired out now
you had far better go away to some watering place mrs_linde walking to the window i have no father to give me money for a journey nora
nora rising oh dont be angry with me mrs_linde going up to her it is you that must not be angry with me dear
the worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter no one to work for and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for chances
one must live and so one becomes selfish when you told me of the happy turn your fortunes have taken you will hardly believe it
i was delighted not so much on your account as on my own nora how do you mean oh i understand
you mean that perhaps torvald_helmer could get you something to do mrs_linde yes that was what i was thinking of
just leave it to me i will broach the subject very cleverly i will think of something that will please him very much
nora he must christine it will make me so happy to be of some use to you mrs_linde how kind you are nora to be so anxious to help me
it is doubly kind in you for you know so little of the burdens and troubles of life nora i i know so little of them
mrs_linde smiling my dear small household cares and that sort of thing you are a child nora nora tosses her head and crosses the stage
you ought not to be so superior mrs_linde no nora you are just like the others they all think that i am incapable of anything really serious mrs_linde
come come nora that i have gone through nothing in this world of cares mrs_linde but my dear nora you have just told me all your troubles
nora pooh those were trifles lowering her voice i have not told you the important thing mrs_linde the important thing what do you mean
nora you look down upon me altogether christine but you ought not to you are proud arent you of having worked so hard and so long for your mother
but it is true that i am both proud and glad to think that i was privileged to make the end of my mother life almost free from care
mrs_linde indeed i dont look down on anyone nora and you are proud to think of what you have done for your brothers
mrs_linde i think i have the right to be nora i think so too but now listen to this i too have something to be proud and glad of
mrs_linde i have no doubt you have but what do you refer to nora speak low suppose torvald_helmer were to hear
he mustnt on any account no one in the world must know christine except you mrs_linde but what is it
nora come here pulls her down on the sofa beside her now i will show you that i too have something to be proud and glad of
it was i who saved torvald_helmer life mrs_linde saved how nora i told you about our trip to italy torvald_helmer would never have recovered if he had not gone there mrs_linde
yes but your father gave you the necessary funds nora smiling yes that is what torvald_helmer and all the others think but
mrs_linde but nora papa didnt give us a shilling it was i who procured the money mrs_linde you all that large sum
nora two hundred and fifty pounds what do you think of that mrs_linde but nora how could you possibly do it
did you win a prize in the lottery nora contemptuously in the lottery there would have been no credit in that
mrs_linde but where did you get it from then nora humming and smiling with an air of mystery hm hm
aha mrs_linde because you couldnt have borrowed it nora couldnt i why not mrs_linde no a wife cannot borrow without her husband consent
oh if it is a wife who has any head for business a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever mrs_linde
nora tossing her head i dont understand it at all nora nora there is no need you should i never said i had borrowed the money
i may have got it some other way lies back on the sofa perhaps i got it from some other admirer
when anyone is as attractive as i am mrs_linde you are a mad creature nora now you know you re full of curiosity christine
mrs_linde listen to me nora dear havent you been a little bit imprudent nora sits up straight is it imprudent to save your husband life
mrs_linde it seems to me imprudent without his knowledge to nora but it was absolutely necessary that he should not know
my goodness cant you understand that it was necessary he should have no idea what a dangerous condition he was in
it was to me that the doctors came and said that his life was in danger and that the only thing to save him was to live in the south
i told him how much i should love to travel abroad like other young wives i tried tears and entreaties with him i told him that he ought to remember the condition i was in and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me
do you suppose i didnt try first of all to get what i wanted as if it were for myself i even hinted that he might raise a loan
he said i was thoughtless and that it was his duty as my husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices as i believe he called them
very well i thought you must be saved and that was how i came to devise a way out of the difficulty mrs_linde
that nearly made him angry christine and did your husband never get to know from your father that the money had not come from him
nora no never papa died just at that time i had meant to let him into the secret and beg him never to reveal it
but he was so ill then alas there never was any need to tell him mrs_linde and since then have you never told your secret to your husband
and besides how painful and humiliating it would be for torvald_helmer with his manly independence to know that he owed me anything
nora good heavens no how could you think so a man who has such strong opinions about these thing it would upset our mutual relations altogether our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now
mrs_linde do you mean never to tell him about it nora meditatively and with a half smile yes someday perhaps after many years when i am no longer as nice looking as i am now
i mean of course when torvald_helmer is no longer as devoted to me as he is now when my dancing and dressing up and reciting have palled on him then it may be a good thing to have something in reserve breaking off
dont laugh at me what nonsense that time will never come now what do you think of my great secret christine
do you still think i am of no use i can tell you too that this affair has caused me a lot of worry
i may tell you that there is something that is called in business quarterly interest and another thing called payment in installments and it is always so dreadfully difficult to manage them
it has been by no means easy for me to meet my engagements punctually i have had to save a little here and there where i could you understand
i couldnt let my child be shabbily dressed i have felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them the sweet little darlings
i have not been able to put aside much from my housekeeping money for torvald_helmer must have a good table mrs_linde
so it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of life poor nora nora of course besides i was the one responsible for it
whenever torvald_helmer has given me money for new dresses and such thing i have never spent more than half of it i have always bought the simplest and cheapest thing
thank heaven any clothes look well on me and so torvald_helmer has never noticed it but it was often very hard on me christine because it is delightful to be really well dressed isnt it
last winter i was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do so i locked myself up and sat writing every evening until quite late at night
many a time i was desperately tired but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to sit there working and earning money
mrs_linde quite so nora well then i have found other ways of earning money it was like being a man
mrs_linde how much have you been able to pay off in that way nora i cant tell you exactly you see it is very difficult to keep an account of a business matter of that kind
i only know that i have paid every penny that i could scrape together many a time i was at my wits end
then i used to sit here and imagine that a rich old gentleman had fallen in love with me mrs_linde
he had died and that when his will was opened it contained written in big letter the instruction the lovely mrs nora torvald_helmer is to have all i possess paid over to her at once in cash
smiles what who was it nora be quiet that mrs_linde but my dear nora who could the man be nora good gracious cant you understand
there was no old gentleman at all it was only something that i used to sit here and imagine when i couldnt think of any way of procuring money
but it all the same now the tiresome old person can stay where he is as far as i am concerned i dont care about him or his will either for i am free from care now
to be able to be free from care quite free from care to be able to play and romp with the child to be able to keep the house beautifully and have everything just as torvald_helmer likes it
jumps up my goodness it delightful to think of christine free from care and think of it soon the spring will come and the big blue sky
perhaps we shall be able to take a little trip perhaps i shall see the sea again oh it a wonderful thing to be alive and be happy
a bell is heard in the hall mrs_linde rising there is the bell perhaps i had better go nora no dont go no one will come in here it is sure to be for torvald_helmer
servant at the hall door excuse me ma am there is a gentleman to see the master and as the doctor is with him nora
who is it nils_krogstad at the door it is i mrs torvald_helmer mrs_linde starts trembles and turns to the window
nora takes a step towards him and speaks in a strained low voice you what is it what do you want to see my husband about
nils_krogstad bank business in a way i have a small post in the bank and i hear your husband is to be our chief now nora
then it is nils_krogstad nothing but dry business matters mrs torvald_helmer absolutely nothing else nora be so good as to go into the study then
she bows indifferently to him and shuts the door into the hall then comes back and makes up the fire in the stove
mrs_linde nora who was that man nora a lawyer of the name of nils_krogstad mrs_linde then it really was he
nora do you know the man mrs_linde i used to many years ago at one time he was a solicitor clerk in our town
nora yes he was mrs_linde he is greatly altered nora he made a very unhappy marriage mrs_linde he is a widower now isnt he
nora with several child there now it is burning up shuts the door of the stove and moves the rocking chair aside
mrs_linde they say he carries on various kinds of business nora really perhaps he does i dont know anything about it
but dont let us think of business it is so tiresome doctor rank comes out of torvald_helmer study before he shuts the door he calls to him
no my dear fellow i wont disturb you i would rather go in to your wife for a little while shuts the door and sees mrs_linde
i beg your pardon i am afraid i am disturbing you too nora no not at all introducing him doctor rank mrs_linde
rank i have often heard mrs_linde name mentioned here i think i passed you on the stairs when i arrived mrs_linde
mrs_linde yes i go up very slowly i cant manage stairs well rank ah some slight internal weakness mrs_linde
no the fact is i have been overworking myself rank nothing more than that then i suppose you have come to town to amuse yourself with our entertainments
mrs_linde i have come to look for work rank is that a good cure for overwork mrs_linde one must live doctor rank
rank yes the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary nora look here doctor rank you know you want to live
rank certainly however wretched i may feel i want to prolong the agony as long as possible all my patients are like that
and so are those who are morally diseased one of them and a bad case too is at this very moment with torvald_helmer mrs_linde sadly
ah nora whom do you mean rank a lawyer of the name of nils_krogstad a fellow you dont know at all
he suffers from a diseased moral character mrs torvald_helmer but even he began talking of its being highly important that he should live
nora did he what did he want to speak to torvald_helmer about rank i have no idea i only heard that it was something about the bank
nora i didnt know this what his name nils_krogstad had anything to do with the bank rank yes he has some sort of appointment there
i dont know whether you find also in your part of the world that there are certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral corruption and as soon as they have found some put the person concerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye on him
to mrs_linde healthy natures are left out in the cold mrs_linde still i think the sick are those who most need taking care of
rank shrugging his shoulders yes there you are that is the sentiment that is turning society into a sick house nora who has been absorbed in her thoughts breaks out into smothered laughter and claps her hands
rank why do you laugh at that have you any notion what society really is nora what do i care about tiresome society
i am laughing at something quite different something extremely amusing tell me doctor rank are all the people who are employed in the bank dependent on torvald_helmer now
rank is that what you find so extremely amusing nora smiling and humming that my affair walking about the room it perfectly glorious to think that we have that torvald_helmer has so much power over so many people
takes the packet from her pocket doctor rank what do you say to a macaroon rank what macaroons i thought they were forbidden here
nora yes but these are some christine gave me mrs_linde what i nora oh well dont be alarmed you couldnt know that torvald_helmer had forbidden them
i must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my teeth but bah once in a way that so isnt it doctor rank
by your leave puts a macaroon into his mouth you must have one too christine and i shall have one just a little one or at most two
walking about i am tremendously happy there is just one thing in the world now that i should dearly love to do
rank well what is that nora it something i should dearly love to say if torvald_helmer could hear me rank well why cant you say it
nora no i darent it so shocking mrs_linde shocking rank well i should not advise you to say it still with us you might
what is it you would so much like to say if torvald_helmer could hear you nora i should just love to say
well i damned rank are you mad mrs_linde nora dear rank say it here he is nora hiding the packet
hush hush hush torvald_helmer comes out of his room with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand
nora well torvald_helmer dear have you got rid of him torvald_helmer yes he has just gone nora let me introduce you this is christine who has come to town
torvald_helmer christine excuse me but i dont know nora mrs_linde dear christine linde torvald_helmer of course a school friend of my wife i presume
mrs_linde yes we have known each other since then nora and just think she has taken a long journey in order to see you
christine is tremendously clever at book keeping and she is frightfully anxious to work under some clever man so as to perfect herself torvald_helmer
and when she heard you had been appointed manager of the bank the news was telegraphed you know she travelled here as quick as she could
torvald_helmer what do you mean mrs_linde no really i nora very sensible mrs_linde nora torvald_helmer i am sure you will be able to do something for christine for my sake wont you
torvald_helmer well it is not altogether impossible i presume you are a widow mrs_linde mrs_linde yes torvald_helmer and have had some experience of book keeping
mrs_linde yes a fair amount torvald_helmer ah well it very likely i may be able to find something for you nora clapping her hands
what did i tell you what did i tell you torvald_helmer you have just come at a fortunate moment mrs_linde
mrs_linde how am i to thank you torvald_helmer there is no need puts on his coat but today you must excuse me rank
wait a minute i will come with you brings his fur coat from the hall and warms it at the fire

come along mrs_linde the place will only be bearable for a mother now rank torvald_helmer and mrs_linde go downstairs
the nurse comes forward with the child nora shuts the hall door nora how fresh and well you look such red cheeks like apples and roses
the child all talk at once while she speaks to them have you had great fun that splendid what you pulled both emmy and bob along on the sledge both at once that was good
you are a clever boy ivar let me take her for a little anne my sweet little baby doll takes the baby from the maid and dances it up and down
yes yes mother will dance with bob too what have you been snowballing i wish i had been there too no no i will take their thing off anne please let me do it it is such fun
go in now you look half frozen there is some hot coffee for you on the stove the nurse goes into the room on the left
nora takes off the child thing and throws them about while they all talk to her at once nora really did a big dog run after you
but it didnt bite you no dogs dont bite nice little dolly child you mustnt look at the parcels ivar what are they
ah i daresay you would like to know no no it something nasty come let us have a game what shall we play at
hide and seek yes we ll play hide and seek bob shall hide first must i hide very well i ll hide first
she and the child laugh and shout and romp in and out of the room at last nora hides under the table the child rush in and out for her but do not see her they hear her smothered laughter run to the table lift up the cloth and find her
shouts of laughter she crawls forward and pretends to frighten them fresh laughter meanwhile there has been a knock at the hall door but none of them has noticed it
the door is half opened and nils_krogstad appears he waits a little the game goes on nils_krogstad excuse me mrs torvald_helmer
nora with a stifled cry turns round and gets up on to her knees ah what do you want nils_krogstad excuse me the outer door was ajar i suppose someone forgot to shut it
nora rising my husband is out mr nils_krogstad nils_krogstad i know that nora what do you want here then nils_krogstad a word with you
nora with me to the child gently go in to nurse what no the strange man wont do mother any harm when he has gone we will have another game
she takes the child into the room on the left and shuts the door after them you want to speak to me
nils_krogstad yes i do nora today it is not the first of the month yet nils_krogstad no it is christmas eve and it will depend on yourself what sort of a christmas you will spend
nora what do you mean today it is absolutely impossible for me nils_krogstad we wont talk about that until later on
this is something different i presume you can give me a moment nora yes yes i can although nils_krogstad good i was in olsen restaurant and saw your husband going down the street nora
yes nils_krogstad with a lady nora what then nils_krogstad may i make so bold as to ask if it was a mrs_linde
nora it was nils_krogstad just arrived in town nora yes today nils_krogstad she is a great friend of yours isnt she
nora she is but i dont see nils_krogstad i knew her too once upon a time nora i am aware of that
nils_krogstad are you so you know all about it i thought as much then i can ask you without beating about the bush is mrs_linde to have an appointment in the bank
nora what right have you to question me mr nils_krogstad you one of my husband subordinates but since you ask you shall know
yes mrs_linde is to have an appointment and it was i who pleaded her cause mr nils_krogstad let me tell you that
nils_krogstad i was right in what i thought then nora walking up and down the stage sometimes one has a tiny little bit of influence i should hope
because one is a woman it does not necessarily follow that when anyone is in a subordinate position mr nils_krogstad they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone who who nils_krogstad
who has influence nora exactly nils_krogstad changing his tone mrs torvald_helmer you will be so good as to use your influence on my behalf
nora what what do you mean nils_krogstad you will be so kind as to see that i am allowed to keep my subordinate position in the bank
nora what do you mean by that who proposes to take your post away from you nils_krogstad oh there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of ignorance
i can quite understand that your friend is not very anxious to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me and i quite understand too whom i have to thank for being turned off
very likely but to come to the point the time has come when i should advise you to use your influence to prevent that
nora but i assure you nils_krogstad nora but mr nils_krogstad i have no influence nils_krogstad havent you i thought you said yourself
just now nora naturally i did not mean you to put that construction on it i what should make you think i have any influence of that kind with my husband
nils_krogstad oh i have known your husband from our student days i dont suppose he is any more unassailable than other husband
nora if you speak slightingly of my husband i shall turn you out of the house nils_krogstad you are bold mrs torvald_helmer
nora i am not afraid of you any longer as soon as the new year comes i shall in a very short time be free of the whole thing
if necessary i am prepared to fight for my small post in the bank as if i were fighting for my life
nils_krogstad controlling himself listen to me mrs torvald_helmer nora so it seems nils_krogstad it is not only for the sake of the money indeed that weighs least with me in the matter
there is another reason well i may as well tell you my position is this i daresay you know like everybody else that once many years ago i was guilty of an indiscretion
nora i think i have heard something of the kind nils_krogstad the matter never came into court but every way seemed to be closed to me after that
so i took to the business that you know of i had to do something and honestly i dont think i ve been one of the worst
my sons are growing up for their sake i must try and win back as much respect as i can in the town
this post in the bank was like the first step up for me and now your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud
but now i must cut myself free from all that nora but you must believe me mr nils_krogstad it is not in my power to help you at all
nils_krogstad then it is because you havent the will but i have means to compel you nora you dont mean that you will tell my husband that i owe you money
to think of his learning my secret which has been my joy and pride in such an ugly clumsy way that he should learn it from you
nils_krogstad hm suppose i were to tell him nora it would be perfectly infamous of you sobbing and it would put me in a horribly disagreeable position nils_krogstad
only disagreeable nora impetuously well do it then and it will be the worse for you my husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are and you certainly wont keep your post then
if my husband does get to know of it of course he will at once pay you what is still owing and we shall have nothing more to do with you
nils_krogstad i asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home that you were afraid of nora nils_krogstad coming a step nearer
listen to me mrs torvald_helmer either you have a very bad memory or you know very little of business i shall be obliged to remind you of a few details
nora what do you mean nils_krogstad when your husband was ill you came to me to borrow two hundred and fifty pounds
nora i didnt know anyone else to go to nils_krogstad i promised to get you that amount nora yes and you did so
your mind was so taken up with your husband illness and you were so anxious to get the money for your journey that you seem to have paid no attention to the conditions of our bargain
nils_krogstad i promised to get you that amount on certain conditions therefore it will not be amiss if i remind you of them
now i promised to get the money on the security of a bond which i drew up nora yes and which i signed
but below your signature there were a few lines constituting your father a surety for the money those lines your father should have signed
i had left the date blank that is to say your father should himself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper
nils_krogstad good nora should he did sign them nils_krogstad do you remember that nora yes i think i remember nils_krogstad then i gave you the bond to send by post to your father
and you naturally did so at once because five or six days afterwards you brought me the bond with your father signature
is that not so nora yes nils_krogstad and then i gave you the money nora well havent i been paying it off regularly
nils_krogstad fairly so yes but to come back to the matter in hand that must have been a very trying time for you mrs torvald_helmer
nora it was indeed nils_krogstad your father was very ill wasnt he nora he was very near his end nils_krogstad and died soon afterwards
tell me mrs torvald_helmer can you by any chance remember what day your father died on what day of the month i mean
nora yes nils_krogstad nora papa died on the th of september nils_krogstad that is correct i have ascertained it for myself
and as that is so there is a discrepancy taking a paper from his pocket which i cannot account for nora
what discrepancy i dont know nils_krogstad the discrepancy consists mrs torvald_helmer in the fact that your father signed this bond three days after his death
nora what do you mean i dont understand nils_krogstad your father died on the th of september but look here your father has dated his signature the nd of october
it is a remarkable thing too that the words nd of october as well as the year are not written in your father handwriting but in one that i think i know
well of course it can be explained your father may have forgotten to date his signature and someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death
it is a discrepancy isnt it nora is silent can you explain it to me nora is still silent there is no harm in that
it all depends on the signature of the name and that is genuine i suppose mrs torvald_helmer it was your father himself who signed his name here
nora after a short pause throws her head up and looks defiantly at him no it was not it was i that wrote papa name
nils_krogstad are you aware that is a dangerous confession nora in what way you shall have your money soon nils_krogstad let me ask you a question why did you not send the paper to your father
if i had asked him for his signature i should have had to tell him what the money was to be used for and when he was so ill himself i couldnt tell him that my husband life was in danger it was impossible
nora it was impossible papa was so ill nils_krogstad it would have been better for you if you had given up your trip abroad
nora no that was impossible that trip was to save my husband life i couldnt give that up nils_krogstad but did it never occur to you that you were committing a fraud on me
i couldnt bear you because you put so many heartless difficulties in my way although you knew what a dangerous condition my husband was in
nora i couldnt take that into account i didnt trouble myself about you at all nils_krogstad mrs torvald_helmer you evidently do not realise clearly what it is that you have been guilty of
but i can assure you that my one false step which lost me all my reputation was nothing more or nothing worse than what you have done
nora you do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run a risk to save your wife life
nils_krogstad the law cares nothing about motives nora then it must be a very foolish law nils_krogstad foolish or not it is the law by which you will be judged if i produce this paper in court
nora i dont believe it is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her dying father anxiety and care is a wife not to be allowed to save her husband life
i dont know much about law but i am certain that there must be laws permitting such thing as that have you no knowledge of such laws you who are a lawyer
you must be a very poor lawyer mr nils_krogstad nils_krogstad maybe but matters of business such business as you and i have had together do you think i dont understand that
very well do as you please but let me tell you this if i lose my position a second time you shall lose yours with me
he bows and goes out through the hall nora appears buried in thought for a short time then tosses her head
nonsense trying to frighten me like that i am not so silly as he thinks begins to busy herself putting the child thing in order
and yet no it impossible i did it for love sake the child in the doorway on the left mother the stranger man has gone out through the gate
nora yes dears i know but dont tell anyone about the stranger man do you hear not even papa child no mother but will you come and play again
nora no no not now child but mother you promised us nora yes but i cant now run away in i have such a lot to do
she gets them into the room by degrees and shuts the door on them then sits down on the sofa takes up a piece of needlework and sews a few stitches but soon stops
run away in my sweet little darlings no throws down the work gets up goes to the hall door and calls out
helen bring the tree in goes to the table on the left opens a drawer and stops again no no it is quite impossible
maid coming in with the tree where shall i put it ma am nora here in the middle of the floor maid
shall i get you anything else nora no thank you i have all i want exit maid nora begins dressing the tree
a candle here and flowers here the horrible man it all nonsense there nothing wrong the tree shall be splendid i will do everything i can think of to please you
torvald_helmer i will sing for you dance for you torvald_helmer comes in with some papers under his arm oh are you back already
torvald_helmer yes has anyone been here nora here no torvald_helmer that is strange i saw nils_krogstad going out of the gate
nora i can see from your manner that he has been here begging you to say a good word for him
and you were to appear to do it of your own accord you were to conceal from me the fact of his having been here didnt he beg that of you too
nora did you oh yes i forgot nils_krogstad was here for a moment torvald_helmer nora yes torvald_helmer nora yes torvald_helmer but torvald_helmer
nora nora and you would be a party to that sort of thing to have any talk with a man like that and give him any sort of promise
and to tell me a lie into the bargain nora a lie torvald_helmer didnt you tell me no one had been here
shakes his finger at her my little songbird must never do that again a songbird must have a clean beak to chirp with no false notes
puts his arm round her waist that is so isnt it yes i am sure it is lets her go we will say no more about it
sits down by the stove how warm and snug it is here turns over his papers nora after a short pause during which she busies herself with the christmas tree
torvald_helmer yes nora i am looking forward tremendously to the fancy dress ball at the stenborgs the day after tomorrow torvald_helmer
and i am tremendously curious to see what you are going to surprise me with nora it was very silly of me to want to do that
torvald_helmer what do you mean nora i cant hit upon anything that will do everything i think of seems so silly and insignificant
torvald_helmer does my little nora acknowledge that at last nora standing behind his chair with her arms on the back of it
i have got authority from the retiring manager to undertake the necessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of the work and i must make use of the christmas week for that so as to have everything in order for the new year
are you very busy torvald_helmer well nora what are all those papers torvald_helmer bank business nora already torvald_helmer nora then that was why this poor nils_krogstad torvald_helmer
hm nora leans against the back of his chair and strokes his hair if you hadnt been so busy i should have asked you a tremendously big favour torvald_helmer
torvald_helmer what is that tell me nora there is no one has such good taste as you and i do so want to look nice at the fancy dress ball
torvald_helmer couldnt you take me in hand and decide what i shall go as and what sort of a dress i shall wear
torvald_helmer aha so my obstinate little woman is obliged to get someone to come to her rescue nora yes torvald_helmer i cant get along a bit without your help
torvald_helmer very well i will think it over we shall manage to hit upon something nora that is nice of you
goes to the christmas tree a short pause how pretty the red flowers look but tell me was it really something very bad that this nils_krogstad was guilty of
torvald_helmer he forged someone name have you any idea what that means nora isnt it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity
torvald_helmer yes or as in so many cases by imprudence i am not so heartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false step of that kind
many a man has been able to retrieve his character if he has openly confessed his fault and taken his punishment
but nils_krogstad did nothing of that sort he got himself out of it by a cunning trick and that is why he has gone under altogether
just think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play the hypocrite with every one how he has to wear a mask in the presence of those near and dear to him even before his own wife and child
nora no you wouldnt would you torvald_helmer nora punishment torvald_helmer nora but do you think it would torvald_helmer and about the child that is the most terrible part of it all nora
nora how torvald_helmer because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the whole life of a home each breath the child take in such a house is full of the germs of evil
nora coming nearer him are you sure of that torvald_helmer my dear i have often seen it in the course of my life as a lawyer
almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a deceitful mother nora why do you only say mother
torvald_helmer it seems most commonly to be the mother influence though naturally a bad father would have the same result every lawyer is familiar with the fact
this nils_krogstad now has been persistently poisoning his own child with lies and dissimulation that is why i say he has lost all moral character
holds out his hands to her that is why my sweet little nora must promise me not to plead his cause
i assure you it would be quite impossible for me to work with him i literally feel physically ill when i am in the company of such people
give me your hand on it come come what is this give me your hand there now that settled nora takes her hand out of his and goes to the opposite side of the christmas tree
how hot it is in here and i have such a lot to do torvald_helmer getting up and putting his papers in order
yes and i must try and read through some of these before dinner and i must think about your costume too
and it is just possible i may have something ready in gold paper to hang up on the tree puts his hand on her head
my precious little singing bird he goes into his room and shuts the door after him nora after a pause whispers no no it isnt true
it impossible it must be impossible the nurse opens the door on the left nurse the little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in to mamma
nora no no no dont let them come in to me you stay with them anne nurse very well ma am shuts the door
nora pale with terror deprave my little child poison my home a short pause then she tosses her head it not true
act ii the same scene the christmas tree is in the corner by the piano stripped of its ornaments and with burnt down candle ends on its dishevelled branches
it cant possibly be true nora cloak and hat are lying on the sofa she is alone in the room walking about uneasily
she stops by the sofa and takes up her cloak nora drops her cloak someone is coming now goes to the door and listens
no it is no one of course no one will come today christmas day nor tomorrow either but perhaps opens the door and looks out
no nothing in the letterbox it is quite empty comes forward what rubbish of course he cant be in earnest about it
such a thing couldnt happen it is impossible i have three little child enter the nurse from the room on the left carrying a big cardboard box
nurse at last i have found the box with the fancy dress nora thanks put it on the table nurse doing so
but it is very much in want of mending nora i should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces
nurse what an idea it can easily be put in order just a little patience nora yes i will go and get mrs_linde to come and help me with it
nurse what out again in this horrible weather you will catch cold ma am and make yourself ill nora well worse than that might happen
how are the child nurse the poor little souls are playing with their christmas presents but nora do they ask much for me
nurse you see they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them nora yes but nurse i shall not be able to be so much with them now as i was before
nurse oh well young child easily get accustomed to anything nora do you think so do you think they would forget their mother if she went away altogether
nurse i want you to tell me something i have often wondered about how could you have the heart to put your own child out among strangers
nurse good heavens went away altogether nora nurse i was obliged to if i wanted to be little nora nurse nora yes but how could you be willing to do it
nurse what when i was going to get such a good place by it a poor girl who has got into trouble should be glad to
besides that wicked man didnt do a single thing for me nora but i suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you
nurse no indeed she hasnt she wrote to me when she was confirmed and when she was married nora putting her arms round her neck
dear old anne you were a good mother to me when i was little nurse little nora poor dear had no other mother but me
nora and if my little ones had no other mother i am sure you would what nonsense i am talking opens the box
go in to them now i must you will see tomorrow how charming i shall look nurse i am sure there will be no one at the ball so charming as you ma am
goes into the room on the left nora begins to unpack the box but soon pushes it away from her if only i dared go out
if only no one would come if only i could be sure nothing would happen here in the meantime stuff and nonsense
no one will come only i mustnt think about it i will brush my muff what lovely lovely gloves out of my thoughts out of my thoughts
one two three four five six screams ah there is someone coming makes a movement towards the door but stands irresolute
enter mrs_linde from the hall where she has taken off her cloak and hat nora oh it you christine there is no one else out there is there
how good of you to come mrs_linde i heard you were up asking for me nora yes i was passing by
as a matter of fact it is something you could help me with let us sit down here on the sofa
tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy dress ball at the stenborgs who live above us and torvald_helmer wants me to go as a neapolitan fisher girl and dance the tarantella that i learned at capri
look here is the dress torvald_helmer had it made for me there but now it is all so torn and i havent any idea mrs_linde
look here mrs_linde i see you are going to keep up the character nora yes torvald_helmer wants me to we will easily put that right
it is only some of the trimming come unsewn here and there needle and thread now then that all we want
nora it is nice of you mrs_linde sewing so you are going to be dressed up tomorrow nora i will tell you what i shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers
but i have completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening yesterday nora gets up and crosses the stage well i dont think yesterday was as pleasant as usual
you ought to have come to town a little earlier christine certainly torvald_helmer does understand how to make a house dainty and attractive
mrs_linde and so do you it seems to me you are not your father daughter for nothing but tell me is doctor rank always as depressed as he was yesterday
nora no yesterday it was very noticeable i must tell you that he suffers from a very dangerous disease he has consumption of the spine poor creature
his father was a horrible man who committed all sorts of excesses and that is why his son was sickly from childhood do you understand
mrs_linde dropping her sewing but my dearest nora how do you know anything about such thing nora walking about pooh
when you have three child you get visits now and then from from married women who know something of medical matters and they talk about one thing and another
mrs_linde goes on sewing a short silence does doctor rank come here everyday nora everyday regularly he is torvald_helmer most intimate friend and a great friend of mine too
he is just like one of the family mrs_linde but tell me this is he perfectly sincere i mean isnt he the kind of man that is very anxious to make himself agreeable
when you introduced him to me yesterday he declared he had often heard my name mentioned in this house but afterwards i noticed that your husband hadnt the slightest idea who i was
nora not in the least what makes you think that mrs_linde so how could doctor rank nora that is quite right christine
at first he used to seem almost jealous if i mentioned any of the dear folk at home so naturally i gave up doing so
torvald_helmer is so absurdly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself as he says but i often talk about such thing with doctor rank because he likes hearing about them
you are still very like a child in many thing and i am older than you in many ways and have a little more experience
mrs_linde listen to me nora let me tell you this you ought to make an end of it with doctor rank
nora what ought i to make an end of mrs_linde of two thing i think yesterday you talked some nonsense about a rich admirer who was to leave you money nora
an admirer who doesnt exist unfortunately but what then mrs_linde is doctor rank a man of means nora yes he is
mrs_linde and has no one to provide for nora no no one but mrs_linde and comes here everyday nora
yes i told you so mrs_linde but how can this well bred man be so tactless nora i dont understand you at all
mrs_linde dont prevaricate nora do you suppose i dont guess who lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds nora
are you out of your senses how can you think of such a thing a friend of ours who comes here everyday
do you realise what a horribly painful position that would be mrs_linde then it really isnt he nora no certainly not
it would never have entered into my head for a moment besides he had no money to lend then he came into his money afterwards
mrs_linde well i think that was lucky for you my dear nora nora no it would never have come into my head to ask doctor rank
although i am quite sure that if i had asked him mrs_linde but of course you wont nora of course not
i have no reason to think it could possibly be necessary but i am quite sure that if i told doctor rank mrs_linde
behind your husband back nora i must make an end of it with the other one and that will be behind his back too
i must make an end of it with him mrs_linde yes that is what i told you yesterday but nora walking up and down
a man can put a thing like that straight much easier than a woman mrs_linde one husband yes nora nonsense
standing still when you pay off a debt you get your bond back dont you mrs_linde yes as a matter of course
nora and can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces and burn it up the nasty dirty paper mrs_linde looks hard at her lays down her sewing and gets up slowly
nora you are concealing something from me nora do i look as if i were mrs_linde something has happened to you since yesterday morning
nora what is it nora going nearer to her christine listens hush there torvald_helmer come home do you mind going in to the child for the present
torvald_helmer cant bear to see dressmaking going on let anne help you mrs_linde gathering some of the thing together certainly but i am not going away from here until we have had it out with one another
she goes into the room on the left as torvald_helmer comes in from the hall nora going up to torvald_helmer i have wanted you so much torvald_helmer dear
torvald_helmer was that the dressmaker nora no it was christine she is helping me to put my dress in order you will see i shall look quite smart
torvald_helmer wasnt that a happy thought of mine now nora splendid but dont you think it is nice of me too to do as you wish
torvald_helmer nice because you do as your husband wishes well well you little rogue i am sure you did not mean it in that way
but i am not going to disturb you you will want to be trying on your dress i expect nora i suppose you are going to work
torvald_helmer yes shows her a bundle of papers look at that i have just been into the bank turns to go into his room
nora torvald_helmer yes nora if your little squirrel were to ask you for something very very prettily torvald_helmer what then
nora would you do it torvald_helmer i should like to hear what it is first nora your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you would be nice and do what she wants
torvald_helmer speak plainly nora your skylark would chirp about in every room with her song rising and falling torvald_helmer well my skylark does that anyhow
nora i would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight torvald_helmer nora you surely dont mean that request you made to me this morning
nora going near him yes torvald_helmer i beg you so earnestly torvald_helmer have you really the courage to open up that question again
nora yes dear you must do as i ask you must let nils_krogstad keep his post in the bank torvald_helmer my dear nora it is his post that i have arranged mrs_linde shall have
yes you have been awfully kind about that but you could just as well dismiss some other clerk instead of nils_krogstad
nora torvald_helmer this is simply incredible obstinacy because you chose to give him a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him i am expected to nora
that isnt the reason torvald_helmer it is for your own sake this fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers you have told me so yourself
he can do you an unspeakable amount of harm i am frightened to death of him torvald_helmer ah i understand it is recollections of the past that scare you
just recall to your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa and how horribly they slandered him
i believe they would have procured his dismissal if the department had not sent you over to inquire into it and if you had not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him
nora what do you mean torvald_helmer naturally you are thinking of your father nora yes yes of course torvald_helmer my little nora there is an important difference between your father and me
your father reputation as a public official was not above suspicion mine is and i hope it will continue to be so as long as i hold my office
nora you never can tell what mischief these man may contrive we ought to be so well off so snug and happy here in our peaceful home and have no cares you and i and the child torvald_helmer
that is why i beg you so earnestly torvald_helmer and it is just by interceding for him that you make it impossible for me to keep him
it is already known at the bank that i mean to dismiss nils_krogstad is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his wife bidding nora
do you suppose i am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole staff to let people think that i am a man to be swayed by all sorts of outside influence
and what if it did torvald_helmer of course if only this obstinate little person can get her way i should very soon feel the consequences of it i can tell you
and besides there is one thing that makes it quite impossible for me to have nils_krogstad in the bank as long as i am manager
nora whatever is that torvald_helmer his moral failings i might perhaps have overlooked if necessary nora yes you could couldnt you torvald_helmer
and i hear he is a good worker too but i knew him when we were boys it was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an incubus in afterlife
i may as well tell you plainly we were once on very intimate terms with one another but this tactless fellow lays no restraint on himself when other people are present
on the contrary he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me and every minute it is i say torvald_helmer old fellow and that sort of thing
i assure you it is extremely painful for me he would make my position in the bank intolerable nora torvald_helmer i dont believe you mean that
torvald_helmer dont you why not nora because it is such a narrow minded way of looking at thing torvald_helmer what are you saying
narrow minded do you think i am narrow minded nora no just the opposite dear and it is exactly for that reason torvald_helmer it the same thing
you say my point of view is narrow minded so i must be so too narrow minded very well i must put an end to this
goes to the hall door and calls helen nora what are you going to do torvald_helmer looking among his papers settle it
enter maid look here take this letter and go downstairs with it at once find a messenger and tell him to deliver it and be quick
the address is on it and here is the money maid very well sir exit with the letter torvald_helmer putting his papers together

oh torvald_helmer call her back do it for my sake for your own sake for the child sake do you hear me torvald_helmer
call her back you dont know what that letter can bring upon us torvald_helmer it too late nora yes it too late
torvald_helmer my dear nora i can forgive the anxiety you are in although really it is an insult to me it is indeed
isnt it an insult to think that i should be afraid of a starving quill driver vengeance but i forgive you nevertheless because it is such eloquent witness to your great love for me
takes her in his arms and that is as it should be my own darling nora come what will you may be sure i shall have both courage and strength if they be needed
you will see i am man enough to take everything upon myself nora in a horror stricken voice what do you mean by that
torvald_helmer everything i say nora recovering herself you will never have to do that torvald_helmer that right well we will share it nora as man and wife should
the whole thing is only the wildest fancy now you must go and play through the tarantella and practise with your tambourine
i shall go into the inner office and shut the door and i shall hear nothing you can make as much noise as you please
that is how it shall be caressing her are you content now there there not these frightened dove eyes turns back at the door
and when rank comes tell him where he will find me nods to her takes his papers and goes into his room and shuts the door after him
nora bewildered with anxiety stands as if rooted to the spot and whispers he was capable of doing it he will do it
he will do it in spite of everything no not that never never anything rather than that oh for some help some way out of it
the door bell rings doctor rank anything rather than that anything whatever it is she puts her hands over her face pulls herself together goes to the door and opens it
rank is standing without hanging up his coat during the following dialogue it begins to grow dark nora good day doctor rank
i knew your ring but you mustnt go in to torvald_helmer now i think he is busy with something rank and you
nora brings him in and shuts the door after him oh you know very well i always have time for you
rank thank you i shall make use of as much of it as i can nora what do you mean by that
as much of it as you can rank well does that alarm you nora it was such a strange way of putting it
is anything likely to happen rank nothing but what i have long been prepared for but i certainly didnt expect it to happen so soon
nora gripping him by the arm what have you found out doctor rank you must tell me rank sitting down by the stove
it is all up with me and it cant be helped nora with a sigh of relief is it about yourself
rank who else it is no use lying to one self i am the most wretched of all my patients mrs torvald_helmer
lately i have been taking stock of my internal economy bankrupt probably within a month i shall lie rotting in the churchyard
the thing itself is cursedly ugly and the worst of it is that i shall have to face so much more that is ugly before that
i shall only make one more examination of myself when i have done that i shall know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will begin
nora what an ugly thing to say rank there is something i want to tell you torvald_helmer refined nature gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly i wont have him in my sick room
nora oh but doctor rank rank i wont have him there not on any account i bar my door to him
as soon as i am quite certain that the worst has come i shall send you my card with a black cross on it and then you will know that the loathsome end has begun
nora you are quite absurd today and i wanted you so much to be in a really good humour rank with death stalking beside me to have to pay this penalty for another man sin
and in every single family in one way or another some such inexorable retribution is being exacted nora putting her hands over her ears
is there any justice in that rubbish do talk of something cheerful rank oh it a mere laughing matter the whole thing
my poor innocent spine has to suffer for my father youthful amusements nora sitting at the table on the left i suppose you mean that he was too partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras dont you
rank yes and to truffles nora truffles yes and oysters too i suppose rank oysters of course that goes without saying
nora and heaps of port and champagne it is sad that all these nice thing should take their revenge on our bones
especially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky bones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them
rank nora yes that the saddest part of it all rank with a searching look at her hm nora after a short pause
why did you smile rank no it was you that laughed nora no it was you that smiled doctor rank rank rising
you are a greater rascal than i thought nora i am in a silly mood today rank so it seems nora putting her hands on his shoulders
dear dear doctor rank death mustnt take you away from torvald_helmer and me rank it is a loss you would easily recover from
those who are gone are soon forgotten nora looking at him anxiously do you believe that rank people form new ties and then nora
who will form new ties rank both you and torvald_helmer when i am gone you yourself are already on the high road to it i think
what did that mrs_linde want here last night nora oho you dont mean to say you are jealous of poor christine
rank yes i am she will be my successor in this house when i am done for this woman will nora
hush dont speak so loud she is in that room rank today again there you see nora she has only come to sew my dress for me
be nice now doctor rank and tomorrow you will see how beautifully i shall dance and you can imagine i am doing it all for you and for torvald_helmer too of course
bless my soul how unreasonable you are sits down on the sofa takes various thing out of the box doctor rank come and sit down here and i will show you something
rank sitting down what is it nora just look at those rank silk stockings nora flesh coloured arent they lovely it is so dark here now but tomorrow
no no no you must only look at the feet oh well you may have leave to look at the legs too
rank hm nora why are you looking so critical dont you think they will fit me rank i have no means of forming an opinion about that
nora looks at him for a moment for shame hits him lightly on the ear with the stockings that to punish you
folds them up again rank and what other nice thing am i to be allowed to see nora not a single thing more for being so naughty
when i am sitting here talking to you as intimately as this i cannot imagine for a moment what would have become of me if i had never come into this house
she looks among the thing humming to herself rank after a short silence nora smiling i believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us
rank in a lower voice looking straight in front of him and to be obliged to leave it all nora nonsense you are not going to leave it
and not be able to leave behind one the slightest token of one gratitude scarcely even a fleeting regret nothing but an empty place which the first comer can fill as well as any other
rank as before nora and if i asked you now for a no rank for what nora for a big proof of your friendship rank
yes yes nora i mean a tremendously big favour rank would you really make me so happy for once nora ah but you dont know what it is yet
rank no but tell me nora i really cant doctor rank it is something out of all reason it means advice and help and a favour rank
the bigger a thing it is the better i cant conceive what it is you mean do tell me havent i your confidence
nora more than anyone else i know you are my truest and best friend and so i will tell you what it is
you know how devotedly how inexpressibly deeply torvald_helmer loves me he would never for a moment hesitate to give his life for me
well doctor rank it is something you must help me to prevent rank leaning towards her nora do you think he is the only one
nora with a slight start the only one rank the only one who would gladly give his life for your sake
i was determined you should know it before i went away and there will never be a better opportunity than this
nora sadly is that it rank now you know it nora and now you know too that you can trust me as you would trust no one else
nora rises deliberately and quietly let me pass rank makes room for her to pass him but sits still nora nora at the hall door
helen bring in the lamp goes over to the stove dear doctor rank that was really horrid of you rank to have loved you as much as anyone else does
was that horrid nora no but to go and tell me so there was really no need rank what do you mean
did you know maid enters with lamp puts it down on the table and goes out nora mrs torvald_helmer tell me had you any idea of this
nora oh how do i know whether i had or whether i hadnt i really cant tell you to think you could be so clumsy doctor rank
we were getting on so nicely rank well at all events you know now that you can command me body and soul
so wont you speak out nora looking at him after what happened rank i beg you to let me know what it is
nora i cant tell you anything now rank yes yes you mustnt punish me in that way let me have permission to do for you whatever a man may do
nora you can do nothing for me now besides i really dont need any help at all you will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my part
it really is so of course it is sits down in the rocking chair and looks at him with a smile you are a nice sort of man doctor rank dont you feel ashamed of yourself now the lamp has come
rank not a bit but perhaps i had better go for ever nora no indeed you shall not of course you must come here just as before
you know very well torvald_helmer cant do without you rank yes but you nora oh i am always tremendously pleased when you come
rank it is just that that put me on the wrong track you are a riddle to me i have often thought that you would almost as soon be in my company as in torvald_helmer
nora yes you see there are some people one loves best and others whom one would almost always rather have as companions
but i always thought it tremendous fun if i could steal down into the maids room because they never moralised at all and talked to each other about such entertaining thing
rank yes there is something in that nora when i was at home of course i loved papa best rank i see
it is their place i have taken nora jumping up and going to him oh dear nice doctor rank i never meant that at all
but surely you can understand that being with torvald_helmer is a little like being with papa enter maid from the hall maid
if you please ma am whispers and hands her a card nora glancing at the card oh puts it in her pocket
rank is there anything wrong nora no no not in the least it is only something it is my new dress rank
what your dress is lying there nora oh yes that one but this is another i ordered it torvald_helmer mustnt know about it
rank oho then that was the great secret nora of course just go in to him he is sitting in the inner room
keep him as long as rank make your mind easy i wont let him escape goes into torvald_helmer room nora to the maid
and he is standing waiting in the kitchen maid yes he came up the back stairs nora but didnt you tell him no one was in
maid yes but it was no good nora he wont go away maid no he says he wont until he has seen you ma am
nora well let him come in but quietly helen you mustnt say anything about it to anyone it is a surprise for my husband
maid yes ma am i quite understand exit nora this dreadful thing is going to happen it will happen in spite of me
no no no it cant happen it shant happen she bolts the door of torvald_helmer room the maid opens the hall door for nils_krogstad and shuts it after him
he is wearing a fur coat high boots and a fur cap nora advancing towards him speak low my husband is at home
nils_krogstad no matter about that nora what do you want of me nils_krogstad an explanation of something nora make haste then
what is it nils_krogstad you know i suppose that i have got my dismissal nora i couldnt prevent it mr nils_krogstad
i fought as hard as i could on your side but it was no good nils_krogstad does your husband love you so little then
he knows what i can expose you to and yet he ventures nora how can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort
nils_krogstad i didnt suppose so at all it would not be the least like our dear torvald_helmer to show so much courage nora
but since you have kept the matter so carefully to yourself i make bold to suppose that you have a little clearer idea than you had yesterday of what it actually is that you have done
mr nils_krogstad a little respect for my husband please nils_krogstad certainly all the respect he deserves nora more than you could ever teach me
nils_krogstad yes such a bad lawyer as i am nora what is it you want of me nils_krogstad only to see how you were mrs torvald_helmer
a mere cashier a quill driver a well a man like me even he has a little of what is called feeling you know
i have been thinking about you all day long nora show it then think of my little child nils_krogstad have you and your husband thought of mine
but never mind about that i only wanted to tell you that you need not take this matter too seriously in the first place there will be no accusation made on my part
nora no of course not i was sure of that nils_krogstad the whole thing can be arranged amicably there is no reason why anyone should know anything about it
it will remain a secret between us three nora my husband must never get to know anything about it nils_krogstad how will you be able to prevent it
am i to understand that you can pay the balance that is owing nora no not just at present nils_krogstad or perhaps that you have some expedient for raising the money soon
nora no expedient that i mean to make use of nils_krogstad well in any case it would have been of no use to you now
if you stood there with ever so much money in your hand i would never part with your bond nora tell me what purpose you mean to put it to
nils_krogstad i shall only preserve it keep it in my possession no one who is not concerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of it
so that if the thought of it has driven you to any desperate resolution nora it has nils_krogstad if you had it in your mind to run away from your home nora
i had nils_krogstad or even something worse nora how could you know that nils_krogstad give up the idea nora how did you know i had thought of that
nils_krogstad most of us think of that at first i did too but i hadnt the courage nora faintly no more had i nils_krogstad in a tone of relief
no that it isnt it you hadnt the courage either nora no i havent i havent nils_krogstad besides it would have been a great piece of folly
once the first storm at home is over i have a letter for your husband in my pocket nora telling him everything
nils_krogstad in as lenient a manner as i possibly could nora quickly he mustnt get the letter tear it up i will find some means of getting money
nils_krogstad excuse me mrs torvald_helmer but i think i told you just now nora i am not speaking of what i owe you
tell me what sum you are asking my husband for and i will get the money nils_krogstad i am not asking your husband for a penny
nora what do you want then nils_krogstad i will tell you i want to rehabilitate myself mrs torvald_helmer i want to get on and in that your husband must help me
for the last year and a half i have not had a hand in anything dishonourable amid all that time i have been struggling in most restricted circumstances
i was content to work my way up step by step now i am turned out and i am not going to be satisfied with merely being taken into favour again
i want to get on i tell you i want to get into the bank again in a higher position your husband must make a place for me nora
that he will never do nils_krogstad he will i know him he dare not protest and as soon as i am in there again with him then you will see
within a year i shall be the manager right hand it will be nils_krogstad and not torvald_helmer who manages the bank
nora that a thing you will never see nils_krogstad do you mean that you will nora i have courage enough for it now
nils_krogstad oh you cant frighten me a fine spoilt lady like you nora you will see you will see nils_krogstad under the ice perhaps
and then in the spring to float up to the surface all horrible and unrecognisable with your hair fallen out nora
down into the cold coal black water you cant frighten me nils_krogstad nor you me people dont do such thing mrs torvald_helmer
besides what use would it be i should have him completely in my power all the same nora afterwards when i am no longer nils_krogstad
have you forgotten that it is i who have the keeping of your reputation nora stands speechlessly looking at him well now i have warned you
and be sure you remember that it is your husband himself who has forced me into such ways as this again
do not do anything foolish when torvald_helmer has had my letter i shall expect a message from him i will never forgive him for that
goodbye mrs torvald_helmer exit through the hall nora goes to the hall door opens it slightly and listens he is going
he is not putting the letter in the box oh no no that impossible opens the door by degrees what is that
he is standing outside he is not going downstairs is he hesitating can he a letter drops into the box then nils_krogstad footsteps are heard until they die away as he goes downstairs
nora utters a stifled cry and runs across the room to the table by the sofa a short pause nora in the letter box
steals across to the hall door there it lies torvald_helmer torvald there is no hope for us now mrs_linde comes in from the room on the left carrying the dress
mrs_linde there i cant see anything more to mend now would you like to try it on nora in a hoarse whisper
christine come here mrs_linde throwing the dress down on the sofa what is the matter with you you look so agitated
nora come here do you see that letter there look you can see it through the glass in the letter box mrs_linde
yes i see it nora that letter is from nils_krogstad mrs_linde nora it was nils_krogstad who lent you the money nora

nora nora or if anything else should happen to me anything for instance that might prevent my being here mrs_linde nora
and if it should happen that there were some one who wanted to take all the responsibility all the blame you understand mrs_linde
nora you are quite out of your mind nora yes yes but how can you suppose nora then you must be my witness that it is not true christine

nora goes to torvald_helmer door opens it and peeps in torvald_helmer from the inner room well may i venture at last to come into my own room again
come along rank now you will see halting in the doorway but what is this nora what is what dear torvald_helmer

sits down at the piano nora takes out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated shawl she hastily drapes the shawl round her
then she springs to the front of the stage and calls out now play for me i am going to dance
torvald_helmer plays and nora dances rank stands by the piano behind torvald_helmer and looks on torvald_helmer as he plays slower slower
nora i cant do it any other way torvald_helmer not so violently nora nora this is the way torvald_helmer stops playing
no no that is not a bit right nora laughing and swinging the tambourine didnt i tell you so rank let me play for her
torvald_helmer getting up yes do i can correct her better then rank sits down at the piano and plays nora dances more and more wildly
she does not seem to hear him her hair comes down and falls over her shoulders she pays no attention to it but goes on dancing
torvald_helmer has taken up a position beside the stove and during her dance gives her frequent instructions enter mrs_linde mrs_linde standing as if spell bound in the doorway
oh nora as she dances such fun christine torvald_helmer my dear darling nora you are dancing as if your life depended on it
nora so it does torvald_helmer stop rank this is sheer madness stop i tell you rank stops playing and nora suddenly stands still
torvald_helmer goes up to her i could never have believed it you have forgotten everything i taught you nora throwing away the tambourine

ah you are still afraid of that fellow nora yes indeed i am torvald_helmer nora i can tell from your looks that there is a letter from him lying there
nora i dont know i think there is but you must not read anything of that kind now nothing horrid must come between us until this is all over
rank whispers to torvald_helmer you mustnt contradict her torvald_helmer taking her in his arms the child shall have her way but tomorrow night after you have danced nora

nora yes dear i will but go in now and you too doctor rank christine you must help me to do up my hair
rank whispers to torvald_helmer as they go out i suppose there is nothing she is not expecting anything torvald_helmer far from it my dear fellow it is simply nothing more than this childish nervousness i was telling you of
they go into the right hand room nora well mrs_linde gone out of town nora i could tell from your face
mrs_linde he is coming home tomorrow evening i wrote a note for him nora you should have let it alone you must prevent nothing
after all it is splendid to be waiting for a wonderful thing to happen mrs_linde what is it that you are waiting for
nora oh you wouldnt understand go in to them i will come in a moment mrs_linde goes into the dining room
nora stands still for a little while as if to compose herself then she looks at her watch five clock seven hours until midnight and then four and twenty hours until the next midnight
then the tarantella will be over twenty four and seven thirty one hours to live torvald_helmer from the doorway on the right where my little skylark
nora going to him with her arms outstretched here she is act iii the same scene the table has been placed in the middle of the stage with chairs around it
a lamp is burning on the table the door into the hall stands open dance music is heard in the room above
mrs_linde is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves of a book she tries to read but does not seem able to collect her thoughts
every now and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer door mrs_linde looking at her watch not yet and the time is nearly up
if only he does not listens again ah there he is goes into the hall and opens the outer door carefully
light footsteps are heard on the stairs she whispers come in there is no one here nils_krogstad in the doorway i found a note from you at home
what does this mean mrs_linde it is absolutely necessary that i should have a talk with you nils_krogstad really and is it absolutely necessary that it should be here
mrs_linde it is impossible where i live there is no private entrance to my room come in we are quite alone
the maid is asleep and the helmers are at the dance upstairs nils_krogstad coming into the room are the helmers really at a dance tonight
mrs_linde yes why not nils_krogstad certainly why not mrs_linde now nils_krogstad let us have a talk nils_krogstad can we two have anything to talk about
mrs_linde we have a great deal to talk about nils_krogstad i shouldnt have thought so mrs_linde no you have never properly understood me
was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all the world a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up
nils_krogstad mrs_linde do you believe i am as absolutely heartless as all that and do you believe that i did it with a light heart
nils_krogstad didnt you mrs_linde nils_krogstad did you really think that nils_krogstad if it were as you say why did you write to me as you did at the time
as i had to break with you it was my duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me
mrs_linde i could do nothing else nils_krogstad wringing his hands so that was it and all this only for the sake of money
mrs_linde you must not forget that i had a helpless mother and two little brothers we couldnt wait for you nils_krogstad your prospects seemed hopeless then
nils_krogstad that may be so but you had no right to throw me over for anyone else sake mrs_linde indeed i dont know
many a time did i ask myself if i had the right to do it nils_krogstad more gently when i lost you it was as if all the solid ground went from under my feet
look at me now i am a shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage mrs_linde but help may be near
nils_krogstad it was near but then you came and stood in my way mrs_linde unintentionally nils_krogstad it was only today that i learned it was your place
i was going to take in the bank nils_krogstad i believe you if you say so but now that you know it are you not going to give it up to me
mrs_linde no because that would not benefit you in the least nils_krogstad oh benefit benefit i would have done it whether or no
mrs_linde i have learned to act prudently life and hard bitter necessity have taught me that nils_krogstad and life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches
mrs_linde then life has taught you something very reasonable but deeds you must believe in nils_krogstad what do you mean by that
mrs_linde you said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to some wreckage nils_krogstad i had good reason to say so
mrs_linde well i am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to some wreckage no one to mourn for no one to care for
nils_krogstad it was your own choice mrs_linde there was no other choice then nils_krogstad well what now mrs_linde nils_krogstad how would it be if we two shipwrecked people could join forces
nils_krogstad what are you saying mrs_linde two on the same piece of wreckage would stand a better chance than each on their own
nils_krogstad christine i mrs_linde what do you suppose brought me to town nils_krogstad do you mean that you gave me a thought
all my life as long as i can remember i have worked and it has been my greatest and only pleasure
mrs_linde i could not endure life without work but now i am quite alone in the world my life is so dreadfully empty and i feel so forsaken
there is not the least pleasure in working for one self nils_krogstad give me someone and something to work for nils_krogstad
i dont trust that it is nothing but a woman overstrained sense of generosity that prompts you to make such an offer of yourself
mrs_linde have you ever noticed anything of the sort in me nils_krogstad could you really do it tell me do you know all about my past life
mrs_linde yes nils_krogstad and do you know what they think of me here mrs_linde you seemed to me to imply that with me you might have been quite another man
nils_krogstad i am certain of it mrs_linde is it too late now nils_krogstad christine are you saying this deliberately yes i am sure you are
i see it in your face have you really the courage then mrs_linde i want to be a mother to someone and your child need a mother
we two need each other nils_krogstad i have faith in your real character i can dare anything together with you nils_krogstad grasps her hands
thanks thanks christine now i shall find a way to clear myself in the eyes of the world ah but i forgot mrs_linde listening
hush the tarantella go go nils_krogstad why what is it mrs_linde do you hear them up there when that is over we may expect them back
nils_krogstad yes yes i will go but it is all no use of course you are not aware what steps i have taken in the matter of the helmers
mrs_linde yes i know all about that nils_krogstad and in spite of that have you the courage to mrs_linde
i understand very well to what lengths a man like you might be driven by despair nils_krogstad if i could only undo what i have done
mrs_linde you cannot your letter is lying in the letter box now nils_krogstad are you sure of that mrs_linde quite sure but nils_krogstad with a searching look at her
is that what it all means that you want to save your friend at any cost tell me frankly is that it
mrs_linde nils_krogstad a woman who has once sold herself for another sake doesnt do it a second time nils_krogstad i will ask for my letter back
i will wait here until torvald_helmer comes i will tell him he must give me my letter back that it only concerns my dismissal that he is not to read it mrs_linde
mrs_linde no no nils_krogstad yes of course i will no nils_krogstad you must not recall your letter nils_krogstad but tell me wasnt it for that very purpose that you asked me to meet you here
mrs_linde in my first moment of fright it was but twenty four hours have elapsed since then and in that time i have witnessed incredible thing in this house
this unhappy secret must be disclosed they must have a complete understanding between them which is impossible with all this concealment and falsehood going on
torvald_helmer must know all about it nils_krogstad very well if you will take the responsibility but there is one thing i can do in any case and i shall do it at once
mrs_linde listening you must be quick and go the dance is over we are not safe a moment longer nils_krogstad
i will wait for you below mrs_linde yes do you must see me back to my door nils_krogstad i have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in my life
goes out through the outer door the door between the room and the hall remains open mrs_linde tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready
what a difference what a difference someone to work for and live for a home to bring comfort into that i will do indeed
i wish they would be quick and come listens ah there they are now i must put on my thing takes up her hat and cloak
torvald_helmer and nora voices are heard outside a key is turned and torvald_helmer brings nora almost by force into the hall
she is in an italian costume with a large black shawl around her he is in evening dress and a black domino which is flying open
nora hanging back in the doorway and struggling with him no no no dont take me in i want to go upstairs again i dont want to leave so early
torvald_helmer but my dearest nora nora please torvald_helmer dear please please only an hour more torvald_helmer not a single minute my sweet nora
you know that was our agreement come along into the room you are catching cold standing there he brings her gently into the room in spite of her resistance
mrs_linde good evening nora christine torvald_helmer you here so late mrs_linde mrs_linde yes you must excuse me i was so anxious to see nora in her dress
yes unfortunately i came too late you had already gone upstairs and i thought i couldnt go away again without having seen you
nora have you been sitting here waiting for me mrs_linde torvald_helmer taking off nora shawl yes take a good look at her
i think she is worth looking at isnt she charming mrs_linde mrs_linde yes indeed she is torvald_helmer doesnt she look remarkably pretty
everyone thought so at the dance but she is terribly self willed this sweet little person what are we to do with her
you will hardly believe that i had almost to bring her away by force nora torvald_helmer you will repent not having let me stay even if it were only for half an hour
she had danced her tarantella and it had been a tremendous success as it deserved although possibly the performance was a trifle too realistic a little more so i mean than was strictly compatible with the limitations of art
torvald_helmer listen to her mrs_linde but never mind about that the chief thing is she had made a success she had made a tremendous success
i took my charming little capri maiden my capricious little capri maiden i should say on my arm took one quick turn round the room a curtsey on either side and as they say in novels the beautiful apparition disappeared
do you think i was going to let her remain there after that and spoil the effect no indeed an exit ought always to be effective mrs_linde but that is what i cannot make nora understand
pooh this room is hot throws his domino on a chair and opens the door of his room hullo it all dark in here
oh of course excuse me he goes in and lights some candles nora in a hurried and breathless whisper well mrs_linde in a low voice
i have had a talk with him nora yes and mrs_linde nora you must tell your husband all about it
nora in an expressionless voice i knew it mrs_linde you have nothing to be afraid of as far as nils_krogstad is concerned but you must tell him
nora i wont tell him mrs_linde then the letter will nora thank you christine now i know what i must do
hush torvald_helmer coming in again well mrs_linde have you admired her mrs_linde yes and now i will say goodnight
torvald_helmer what already is this yours this knitting mrs_linde taking it yes thank you i had very nearly forgotten it
torvald_helmer so you knit mrs_linde of course torvald_helmer do you know you ought to embroider mrs_linde really why torvald_helmer
you hold the embroidery thus in your left hand and use the needle with the right like this with a long easy sweep
but in the case of knitting that can never be anything but ungraceful look here the arms close together the knitting needles going up and down it has a sort of chinese effect
yes it far more becoming let me show you do you see mrs_linde yes perhaps torvald_helmer that was really excellent champagne they gave us
mrs_linde well goodnight nora and dont be self willed any more torvald_helmer that right mrs_linde mrs_linde goodnight mr torvald_helmer torvald_helmer accompanying her to the door
goodnight goodnight i hope you will get home all right i should be very happy to but you havent any great distance to go
goodnight goodnight she goes out he shuts the door after her and comes in again ah at last we have got rid of her
she is a frightful bore that woman nora arent you very tired torvald_helmer no not in the least nora nor sleepy
torvald_helmer not a bit on the contrary i feel extraordinarily lively and you you really look both tired and sleepy nora yes i am very tired
i want to go to sleep at once torvald_helmer there you see it was quite right of me not to let you stay there any longer
nora everything you do is quite right torvald_helmer kissing her on the forehead now my little skylark is speaking reasonably
did you notice what good spirits rank was in this evening nora really was he i didnt speak to him at all
torvald_helmer and i very little but i have not for a long time seen him in such good form looks for a while at her and then goes nearer to her
it is delightful to be at home by ourselves again to be all alone with you you fascinating charming little darling nora
dont look at me like that torvald_helmer why shouldnt i look at my dearest treasure at all the beauty that is mine all my very own
nora going to the other side of the table you mustnt say thing like that to me tonight torvald_helmer following her
you have still got the tarantella in your blood i see and it makes you more captivating than ever listen the guests are beginning to go now
in a lower voice nora soon the whole house will be quiet nora yes i hope so torvald_helmer yes my own darling nora
do you know when i am out at a party with you like this why i speak so little to you keep away from you and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then do you know why i do that
it is because i make believe to myself that we are secretly in love and you are my secretly promised bride and that no one suspects there is anything between us
and when we are leaving and i am putting the shawl over your beautiful young shoulders on your lovely neck then i imagine that you are my young bride and that we have just come from the wedding and i am bringing you for the first time into our home to be alone with you for the first time quite alone with my shy little darling
nora yes yes i know very well your thoughts are with me all the time torvald_helmer all this evening i have longed for nothing but you
when i watched the seductive figures of the tarantella my blood was on fire i could endure it no longer and that was why i brought you down so early nora
go away torvald_helmer you must let me go i wont torvald_helmer what that you re joking my little nora you wont you wont
am i not your husband a knock is heard at the outer door nora starting did you hear torvald_helmer going into the hall
who is it rank outside it is i may i come in for a moment torvald_helmer in a fretful whisper oh what does he want now
aloud wait a minute unlocks the door come that kind of you not to pass by our door rank i thought i heard your voice and felt as if i should like to look in
with a swift glance round ah yes these dear familiar room you are very happy and cosy in here you two torvald_helmer
why shouldnt one enjoy everything in this world at any rate as much as one can and as long as one can
it seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty well upstairs too rank excellently why shouldnt i the wine was capital torvald_helmer
especially the champagne rank so you noticed that too it is almost incredible how much i managed to put away nora
torvald_helmer drank a great deal of champagne tonight too rank did he nora yes and he is always in such good spirits afterwards
rank well why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a well spent day torvald_helmer well spent i am afraid i cant take credit for that
rank clapping him on the back but i can you know nora doctor rank you must have been occupied with some scientific investigation today
rank exactly torvald_helmer just listen little nora talking about scientific investigations nora and may i congratulate you on the result rank indeed you may
nora was it favourable then rank the best possible for both doctor and patient certainty nora quickly and searchingly certainty rank absolute certainty
so wasnt i entitled to make a merry evening of it after that nora yes you certainly were doctor rank torvald_helmer
i think so too so long as you dont have to pay for it in the morning rank oh well one cant have anything in this life without paying for it
nora doctor rank are you fond of fancy dress balls rank yes if there is a fine lot of pretty costumes nora tell me what shall we two wear at the next
torvald_helmer little featherbrain are you thinking of the next already rank we two yes i can tell you you shall go as a good fairy torvald_helmer
yes but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume for that rank let your wife go dressed just as she is in everyday life
torvald_helmer that was really very prettily turned but cant you tell us what you will be rank yes my dear friend i have quite made up my mind about that
torvald_helmer well rank at the next fancy dress ball i shall be invisible torvald_helmer that a good joke rank there is a big black hat
have you never heard of hats that make you invisible if you put one on no one can see you torvald_helmer suppressing a smile
yes you are quite right rank but i am clean forgetting what i came for torvald_helmer give me a cigar one of the dark havanas
torvald_helmer with the greatest pleasure offers him his case rank takes a cigar and cuts off the end thanks nora striking a match
let me give you a light rank thank you she holds the match for him to light his cigar and now goodbye
torvald_helmer goodbye goodbye dear old man nora sleep well doctor rank rank thank you for that wish nora wish me the same
rank you well if you want me to sleep well and thanks for the light he nods to them both and goes out
torvald_helmer in a subdued voice he has drunk more than he ought nora absently maybe torvald_helmer takes a bunch of keys out of his pocket and goes into the hall
torvald_helmer what are you going to do there torvald_helmer emptying the letter box it is quite full there will be no room to put the newspaper in tomorrow morning
nora are you going to work tonight torvald_helmer you know quite well i not what is this someone has been at the lock
nora at the lock torvald_helmer yes someone has what can it mean i should never have thought the maid here is a broken hairpin
nora it is one of yours nora quickly then it must have been the child torvald_helmer then you must get them out of those ways
there at last i have got it open takes out the contents of the letter box and calls to the kitchen helen helen put out the light over the front door
goes back into the room and shuts the door into the hall he holds out his hand full of letter look at that look what a heap of them there are
turning them over what on earth is that nora at the window the letter no torvald_helmer no torvald_helmer two cards of rank nora
of doctor rank torvald_helmer looking at them doctor rank they were on the top he must have put them in when he went out
nora is there anything written on them torvald_helmer there is a black cross over the name look there what an uncomfortable idea
it looks as if he were announcing his own death nora it is just what he is doing torvald_helmer what do you know anything about it
has he said anything to you nora yes he told me that when the cards came it would be his leave taking from us
he means to shut himself up and die torvald_helmer my poor old friend certainly i knew we should not have him very long with us
but so soon and so he hides himself away like a wounded animal nora if it has to happen it is best it should be without a word
dont you think so torvald_helmer walking up and down he had so grown into our life i cant think of him as having gone out of them
he with his sufferings and his loneliness was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness well perhaps it is best so
for him anyway standing still and perhaps for us too nora we two are thrown quite upon each other now puts his arms round her
do you know nora i have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger so that i might risk my life blood and everything for your sake
my darling wife i dont feel as if i could hold you tight enough nora disengages herself and says firmly and decidedly
now you must read your letter torvald_helmer no no not tonight i want to be with you my darling wife
nora with the thought of your friend death torvald_helmer you are right it has affected us both something ugly has come between us the thought of the horrors of death
we must try and rid our minds of that until then we will each go to our own room nora hanging on his neck
goodnight torvald_helmer goodnight torvald_helmer kissing her on the forehead goodnight my little singing bird sleep sound nora now i will read my letter through
he takes his letter and goes into his room shutting the door after him nora gropes distractedly about seizes torvald_helmer domino throws it round her while she says in quick hoarse spasmodic whispers
never to see him again never never puts her shawl over her head never to see my child again either never again
never never ah the icy black water the unfathomable depths if only it were over he has got it now now he is reading it
she is about to rush out through the hall when torvald_helmer opens his door hurriedly and stands with an open letter in his hand
goodbye torvald_helmer and my child torvald_helmer nora nora ah torvald_helmer what is this do you know what is in this letter
nora yes i know let me go let me get out torvald_helmer holding her back where are you going nora trying to get free
you shant save me torvald_helmer reeling true is this true that i read here horrible no no it is impossible that it can be true
nora it is true i have loved you above everything else in the world torvald_helmer oh dont let us have any silly excuses
nora taking a step towards him torvald_helmer miserable creature what have you done nora let me go you shall not suffer for my sake
you shall not take it upon yourself torvald_helmer no tragic airs please locks the hall door here you shall stay and give me an explanation
do you understand what you have done answer me do you understand what you have done nora looks steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in her face
yes now i am beginning to understand thoroughly torvald_helmer walking about the room what a horrible awakening all these eight years she who was my joy and pride a hypocrite a liar worse worse a criminal
the unutterable ugliness of it all for shame for shame nora is silent and looks steadily at him he stops in front of her
i ought to have suspected that something of the sort would happen i ought to have foreseen it all your father want of principle be silent all your father want of principle has come out in you
no religion no morality no sense of duty how i am punished for having winked at what he did i did it for your sake and this is how you repay me
nora yes that just it torvald_helmer now you have destroyed all my happiness you have ruined all my future it is horrible to think of
i am in the power of an unscrupulous man he can do what he likes with me ask anything he likes of me give me any orders he pleases i dare not refuse
and i must sink to such miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman nora when i am out of the way you will be free
torvald_helmer no fine speeches please your father had always plenty of those ready too what good would it be to me if you were out of the way as you say
he can make the affair known everywhere and if he does i may be falsely suspected of having been a party to your criminal action
not the slightest very likely people will think i was behind it all that it was i who prompted you and i have to thank you for all this you whom i have cherished during the whole of our married life
do you understand now what it is you have done for me nora coldly and quietly yes torvald_helmer it is so incredible that i cant take it in
but we must come to some understanding take off that shawl take it off i tell you i must try and appease him some way or another
and as for you and me it must appear as if everything between us were just as before but naturally only in the eyes of the world
the matter must be hushed up at any cost you will still remain in my house that is a matter of course
to think that i should be obliged to say so to one whom i have loved so dearly and whom i still
but i shall not allow you to bring up the child i dare not trust them to you no that is all over
from this moment happiness is not the question all that concerns us is to save the remains the fragments the appearance a ring is heard at the front door bell
torvald_helmer with a start what is that so late can the worst can he hide yourself nora say you are ill
nora stands motionless torvald_helmer goes and unlocks the hall door maid half dressed comes to the door a letter for the mistress
torvald_helmer give it to me takes the letter and shuts the door yes it is from him you shall not have it i will read it myself
nora yes read it torvald_helmer standing by the lamp i scarcely have the courage to do it it may mean ruin for both of us
tears open the letter runs his eye over a few lines looks at a paper enclosed and gives a shout of joy
no i must know nora she looks at him questioningly nora no i must read it once again yes it is true
i am saved nora i am saved nora and i torvald_helmer you too of course we are both saved both you and i look he sends you your bond back
he says he regrets and repents that a happy change in his life never mind what he says we are saved nora no one can do anything to you
oh nora nora no first i must destroy these hateful thing let me see takes a look at the bond no no i wont look at it
the whole thing shall be nothing but a bad dream to me tears up the bond and both letter throws them all into the stove and watches them burn
there now it doesnt exist any longer he says that since christmas eve you these must have been three dreadful days for you nora
nora i have fought a hard fight these three days torvald_helmer and suffered agonies and seen no way out but no we wont call any of the horrors to mind
we will only shout with joy and keep saying it all over it all over listen to me nora you dont seem to realise that it is all over
what is this such a cold set face my poor little nora i quite understand you dont feel as if you could believe that i have forgiven you
but it is true nora i swear it i have forgiven you everything i know that what you did you did out of love for me
nora that is true torvald_helmer you have loved me as a wife ought to love her husband only you had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used
but do you suppose you are any the less dear to me because you dont understand how to act on your own responsibility
i should not be a man if this womanly helplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my eyes
you must not think anymore about the hard thing i said in my first moment of consternation when i thought everything was going to overwhelm me
no no only lean on me i will advise you and direct you i have forgiven you nora i swear to you
i have forgiven you nora thank you for your forgiveness she goes out through the door to the right torvald_helmer no dont go
looks in what are you doing in there nora from within taking off my fancy dress torvald_helmer standing at the open door
yes do try and calm yourself and make your mind easy again my frightened little singing bird be at rest and feel secure i have broad wings to shelter you under
here is shelter for you here i will protect you like a hunted dove that i have saved from a hawk claws i will bring peace to your poor beating heart
walks up and down by the door how warm and cosy our home is nora it will come little by little nora believe me
very soon you wont need me to assure you that i have forgiven you you will yourself feel the certainty that i have done so
tomorrow morning you will look upon it all quite differently soon everything will be just as it was before can you suppose i should ever think of such a thing as repudiating you or even reproaching you
there is something so indescribably sweet and satisfying to a man in the knowledge that he has forgiven his wife forgiven her freely and with all his heart
it seems as if that had made her as it were doubly his own he has given her a new life so to speak and she has in a way become both wife and child to him
you have no idea what a true man heart is like nora so you shall be for me after this my little scared helpless darling
have no anxiety about anything nora only be frank and open with me and i will serve as will and conscience both to you
what is this not gone to bed have you changed your thing nora in everyday dress yes torvald_helmer i have changed my thing now
torvald_helmer but what for so late as this nora i shall not sleep tonight torvald_helmer but my dear nora nora looking at her watch
it is not so very late sit down here torvald_helmer you and i have much to say to one another she sits down at one side of the table
torvald_helmer nora what is this this cold set face nora sit down it will take some time i have a lot to talk over with you
torvald_helmer sits down at the opposite side of the table you alarm me nora and i dont understand you nora no that is just it
you dont understand me and i have never understood you either before tonight no you mustnt interrupt me you must simply listen to what i say
torvald_helmer this is a settling of accounts torvald_helmer what do you mean by that nora after a short silence isnt there one thing that strikes you as strange in our sitting here like this
does it not occur to you that this is the first time we two you and i husband and wife have had a serious conversation
in all these eight years longer than that from the very beginning of our acquaintance we have never exchanged a word on any serious subject
torvald_helmer what is that nora we have been married now eight years torvald_helmer what do you mean by serious nora torvald_helmer
was it likely that i would be continually and forever telling you about worries that you could not help me to bear
nora i am not speaking about business matters i say that we have never sat down in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of anything
torvald_helmer but dearest nora would it have been any good to you nora that is just it you have never understood me
i have been greatly wronged torvald_helmer first by papa and then by you torvald_helmer what by us two by us two who have loved you better than anyone else in the world
nora shaking her head you have never loved me you have only thought it pleasant to be in love with me
when i was at home with papa he told me his opinion about everything and so i had the same opinions and if i differed from him i concealed the fact because he would not have liked it
torvald_helmer nora what do i hear you saying nora it is perfectly true torvald_helmer he called me his doll child and he played with me just as i used to play with my dolls
and when i came to live with you torvald_helmer what sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage
nora undisturbed i mean that i was simply transferred from papa hands into yours you arranged everything according to your own taste and so i got the same tastes as you or
when i look back on it it seems to me as if i had been living here like a poor woman just from hand to mouth
else i pretended to i am really not quite sure which i think sometimes the one and sometimes the other i have existed merely to perform tricks for you torvald_helmer
but you would have it so you and papa have committed a great sin against me it is your fault that i have made nothing of my life
torvald_helmer how unreasonable and how ungrateful you are nora have you not been happy here nora no i have never been happy
i thought i was but it has never really been so torvald_helmer not not happy nora no only merry and you have always been so kind to me
i have been your doll wife just as at home i was papa doll child and here the child have been my dolls
i thought it great fun when you played with me just as they thought it great fun when i played with them
but our home has been nothing but a playroom that is what our marriage has been torvald_helmer there is some truth in what you say exaggerated and strained as your view of it is
but for the future it shall be different playtime shall be over and lesson time shall begin nora whose lessons mine or the child
torvald_helmer both yours and the child my darling nora nora alas torvald_helmer you are not the man to educate me into being a proper wife for you
torvald_helmer and you can say that nora and i how am i fitted to bring up the child torvald_helmer nora nora didnt you say so yourself a little while ago that you dare not trust me to bring them up
torvald_helmer in a moment of anger why do you pay any heed to that nora indeed you were perfectly right i am not fit for the task
there is another task i must undertake first i must try and educate myself you are not the man to help me in that
i must do that for myself and that is why i am going to leave you now torvald_helmer springing up what do you say
nora i must stand quite alone if i am to understand myself and everything about me it is for that reason that i cannot remain with you any longer
torvald_helmer nora nora nora i am going away from here now at once i am sure christine will take me in for the night torvald_helmer
you are out of your mind i wont allow it i forbid you nora it is no use forbidding me anything any longer
i will take with me what belongs to myself i will take nothing from you either now or later torvald_helmer what sort of madness is this
nora tomorrow i shall go home i mean to my old home it will be easiest for me to find something to do there
torvald_helmer you blind foolish woman nora i must try and get some sense torvald_helmer to desert your home your husband and your child
and you dont consider what people will say nora i cannot consider that at all i only know that it is necessary for me
torvald_helmer it shocking this is how you would neglect your most sacred duties nora what do you consider my most sacred duties
torvald_helmer do i need to tell you that are they not your duties to your husband and your child nora i have other duties just as sacred
torvald_helmer that you have not what duties could those be nora duties to myself torvald_helmer before all else you are a wife and a mother
i believe that before all else i am a reasonable human being just as you are or at all events that i must try and become one
i know quite well torvald_helmer that most people would think you right and that views of that kind are to be found in books but i can no longer content myself with what most people say or with what is found in books
nora i dont believe that any longer i must think over thing for myself and get to understand them torvald_helmer can you not understand your place in your own home
have you not a reliable guide in such matters as that have you no religion nora i am afraid torvald_helmer i do not exactly know what religion is
torvald_helmer what are you saying nora i know nothing but what the clergyman said when i went to be confirmed he told us that religion was this and that and the other
when i am away from all this and am alone i will look into that matter too i will see if what the clergyman said is true or at all events if it is true for me
torvald_helmer this is unheard of in a girl of your age but if religion cannot lead you aright let me try and awaken your conscience
i suppose you have some moral sense or answer me am i to think you have none nora i assure you torvald_helmer that is not an easy question to answer
i really dont know the thing perplexes me altogether i only know that you and i look at it in quite a different light
i am learning too that the law is quite another thing from what i supposed but i find it impossible to convince myself that the law is right
according to it a woman has no right to spare her old dying father or to save her husband life i cant believe that
torvald_helmer you talk like a child you dont understand the conditions of the world in which you live nora no i dont
but now i am going to try i am going to see if i can make out who is right the world or i torvald_helmer
you are ill nora you are delirious i almost think you are out of your mind nora i have never felt my mind so clear and certain as tonight
torvald_helmer and is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake your husband and your child nora yes it is
torvald_helmer then there is only one possible explanation nora what is that torvald_helmer you do not love me anymore nora no that is just it
torvald_helmer nora and you can say that nora it gives me great pain torvald_helmer for you have always been so kind to me but i cannot help it
i do not love you any more torvald_helmer regaining his composure is that a clear and certain conviction too nora yes absolutely clear and certain
that is the reason why i will not stay here any longer torvald_helmer and can you tell me what i have done to forfeit your love
nora yes indeed i can it was tonight when the wonderful thing did not happen then i saw you were not the man i had thought you were
i have waited so patiently for eight years for goodness knows i knew very well that wonderful thing dont happen every day
then this horrible misfortune came upon me and then i felt quite certain that the wonderful thing was going to happen at last
when nils_krogstad letter was lying out there never for a moment did i imagine that you would consent to accept this man conditions
torvald_helmer explain yourself better i dont understand you nora i was so absolutely certain that you would say to him publish the thing to the whole world
when that was done i was so absolutely certain you would come forward and take everything upon yourself and say i am the guilty one
and when that was done torvald_helmer yes what then when i had exposed my wife to shame and disgrace nora torvald_helmer nora
nora you mean that i would never have accepted such a sacrifice on your part no of course not but what would my assurances have been worth against yours
that was the wonderful thing which i hoped for and feared and it was to prevent that that i wanted to kill myself
torvald_helmer i would gladly work night and day for you nora bear sorrow and want for your sake but no man would sacrifice his honour for the one he loves
nora it is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done torvald_helmer oh you think and talk like a heedless child
as soon as your fear was over and it was not fear for what threatened me but for what might happen to you when the whole thing was past as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing at all had happened
exactly as before i was your little skylark your doll which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care because it was so brittle and fragile
torvald_helmer it was then it dawned upon me that for eight years i had been living here with a strange man and had borne him three child
nora maybe but you neither think nor talk like the man i could bind myself to getting up oh i cant bear to think of it
i could tear myself into little bits torvald_helmer sadly i see i see an abyss has opened between us there is no denying it
but nora would it not be possible to fill it up nora as i am now i am no wife for you
torvald_helmer i have it in me to become a different man nora perhaps if your doll is taken away from you torvald_helmer
but to part to part from you no no nora i cant understand that idea nora going out to the right that makes it all the more certain that it must be done
she comes back with her cloak and hat and a small bag which she puts on a chair by the table
torvald_helmer nora nora not now wait until tomorrow nora putting on her cloak i cannot spend the night in a strange man room
torvald_helmer but cant we live here like brother and sister nora putting on her hat you know very well that would not last long
puts the shawl round her goodbye torvald_helmer i wont see the little ones i know they are in better hands than mine
as i am now i can be of no use to them torvald_helmer but some day nora some day nora how can i tell
i have no idea what is going to become of me torvald_helmer but you are my wife whatever becomes of you
i have heard that when a wife deserts her husband house as i am doing now he is legally freed from all obligations towards her
nora listen torvald_helmer in any case i set you free from all your obligations you are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way any more than i shall
there must be perfect freedom on both sides see here is your ring back give me mine torvald_helmer that too nora
that too torvald_helmer here it is nora that right now it is all over i have put the keys here the maids know all about everything in the house better than i do
tomorrow after i have left her christine will come here and pack up my own thing that i brought with me from home
i will have them sent after me torvald_helmer all over all over nora shall you never think of me again nora i know i shall often think of you the child and this house
torvald_helmer may i write to you nora nora no never you must not do that torvald_helmer but at least let me send you
nora nothing nothing torvald_helmer let me help you if you are in want nora no i can receive nothing from a stranger
torvald_helmer nora can i never be anything more than a stranger to you nora taking her bag ah torvald_helmer the most wonderful thing of all would have to happen
torvald_helmer tell me what that would be nora both you and i would have to be so changed that oh torvald_helmer i dont believe any longer in wonderful thing happening
torvald_helmer but i will believe in it tell me so changed that nora that our life together would be a real wedlock
goodbye she goes out through the hall torvald_helmer sinks down on a chair at the door and buries his face in his hands
nora nora looks round and rises empty she is gone a hope flashes across his mind the most wonderful thing of all
