unesco has inscribed ibsen autographed manuscripts of doll house on the memory of the world register in in recognition of their historical value
the title of the play is most commonly translated as doll house though some scholars use doll house john simon says that doll house is the british term for what call dollhouse
egil törnqvist says of the alternative title rather than being superior to the traditional rendering it simply sounds more idiomatic to americans
$nora$ $torvald_helmer$ wife of $torvald_helmer$ mother of three is living out the ideal of the century wife but leaves her family at the end of the play
$torvald_helmer$ $nora$ #husband# newly promoted $bank$ manager professes to be enamoured of his wife but their marriage stifles her dr rank a rich family friend

the only mother $nora$ knew she now cares for $nora$ #child# the porter delivers christmas tree to the $torvald_helmer$ household at the beginning of the play
the play opens at christmas #time# as $nora$ $torvald_helmer$ enters her home carrying many packages $nora$ #husband# $torvald_helmer$ is working in his study when she arrives
he teases her about how the previous year she had spent weeks making gifts and ornaments by hand because #money# was scarce
this year $torvald_helmer$ is due promotion at the $bank$ where he works so $nora$ feels that they can let themselves go little
the maid announces two visitors mrs kristine linde an old friend of $nora$ who has come seeking employment and dr rank close friend of the family who is let into the study
he playfully rebukes her for spending so much #money# on christmas gifts calling her his little squirrel kristine has had difficult few years ever since her #husband# died leaving her with no #money# or #child#
$nora$ says that #thing# have not been easy for them either $torvald_helmer$ became sick and they had to travel to italy so he could recover
kristine explains that when her mother was ill she had to take care of her brothers but now that they are grown she feels her #life# is unspeakably empty
$nora$ is offended so she teases the idea that she got #money# from some admirer so they could travel to italy to improve $torvald_helmer$ health
she told $torvald_helmer$ that her father gave her the #money# but in fact she managed to illegally borrow it without his knowledge because women couldnt do #anything# economical like signing checks without their #husband#
$nora$ promises to talk to $torvald_helmer$ about finding her job kristine gently tells $nora$ that she is like #child# over the years she has been secretly working and saving up to pay it off
$nils_krogstad$ lower level employee at $torvald_helmer$ $bank$ arrives and goes into the study $nora$ is clearly uneasy when she sees him
dr rank leaves the study and mentions that he feels wretched though like everyone he wants to go on living in contrast to his physical illness he says that the #man# in the study $nils_krogstad$ is morally diseased
$nora$ asks him if he can give kristine position at the $bank$ and $torvald_helmer$ is very positive saying that this is fortunate moment as position has just become available
after the meeting with $nils_krogstad$ $torvald_helmer$ comes out of the study $torvald_helmer$ kristine and dr rank leave the house leaving $nora$ alone
the nanny returns with the #child# and $nora$ plays with them for while until $nils_krogstad$ creeps through the ajar #door# into the living #room# and surprises her
$nils_krogstad$ tells $nora$ that $torvald_helmer$ intends to fire him at the $bank$ and asks her to intercede with $torvald_helmer$ to allow him to keep his job
she refuses and $nils_krogstad$ threatens to blackmail her about the loan she took out for the trip to italy he knows that she obtained this loan by forging her father signature after his death
$torvald_helmer$ refuses to hear her pleas explaining that $nils_krogstad$ is liar and hypocrite and that he committed terrible crime he forged someone name
$nils_krogstad$ leaves and when $torvald_helmer$ returns $nora$ tries to convince him not to fire $nils_krogstad$ $torvald_helmer$ feels physically ill in the presence of #man# poisoning his own #child# with lies and dissimulation
kristine arrives to help $nora$ repair dress for costume function that she and $torvald_helmer$ plan to attend the next day
$torvald_helmer$ returns from the $bank$ and $nora$ pleads with him to reinstate $nils_krogstad$ claiming she is worried $nils_krogstad$ will publish libelous articles about $torvald_helmer$ and ruin his career
$torvald_helmer$ dismisses her fears and explains that although $nils_krogstad$ is good worker and seems to have turned his #life# around he must be fired because he is too familial around $torvald_helmer$ in front of other $bank$ personnel
$nora$ asks him for favor but rank responds by revealing that he has entered the terminal stage of tuberculosis of the spine and that he has always been secretly in love with her
$nora$ tries to deny the first revelation and make light of it but is more disturbed by his declaration of love
she then clumsily attempts to tell him that she is not in love with him but that she loves him dearly as friend
$torvald_helmer$ then retires to his study to work dr rank the family friend arrives desperate after being fired by $torvald_helmer$ $nils_krogstad$ arrives at the house
when $nils_krogstad$ confronts $nora$ he declares that he no longer cares about the remaining balance of $nora$ loan but that he will instead preserve the associated bond to blackmail $torvald_helmer$ into not only keeping him employed but also promoting him
$nora$ convinces dr rank to go into $torvald_helmer$ study so he will not see $nils_krogstad$ $nora$ explains that she has done her best to persuade her #husband# but he refuses to change his mind
$nils_krogstad$ informs $nora$ that he has written #letter# detailing her crime forging her father signature of surety on the bond and put it in $torvald_helmer$ mailbox which is locked
$nora$ tells kristine of her difficult situation she gives her $nils_krogstad$ card with his address and asks her to try to convince him to relent
$torvald_helmer$ enters and tries to retrieve his mail but $nora$ distracts him by begging him to help her with the dance she has been rehearsing for the costume party feigning anxiety about performing
when the others go to dinner $nora$ stays behind for few minutes and contemplates killing herself to save her #husband# from the shame of the revelation of her crime and to pre empty any gallant gesture on his part to save her reputation
kristine tells $nils_krogstad$ that she only married her #husband# because she had no other means to support her sick mother and young siblings and that she has returned to offer him her love again
she believes that he would not have stooped to unethical behavior if he had not been devastated by her abandonment and been in dire financial straits
she dances so badly and acts so childishly that $torvald_helmer$ agrees to spend the whole evening coaching her $nils_krogstad$ changes his mind and offers to take back his #letter# from $torvald_helmer$
after literally dragging $nora$ home from the party $torvald_helmer$ goes to check his mail but is interrupted by dr rank who has followed them
dr rank chats for while conveying obliquely to $nora$ that this is final goodbye as he has determined that his death is near
however kristine decides that $torvald_helmer$ should know the truth for the sake of his and $nora$ marriage dr rank leaves and $torvald_helmer$ retrieves his #letter#
enraged he declares that he is now completely in $nils_krogstad$ power he must yield to $nils_krogstad$ demands and keep quiet about the whole affair
as he reads them $nora$ steels herself to take her #life# $torvald_helmer$ confronts her with $nils_krogstad$ #letter# he berates $nora$ calling her dishonest and immoral woman and telling her that she is unfit to raise their #child#
he says that from now on their marriage will be only matter of appearances a maid enters delivering #letter# to $nora$
$torvald_helmer$ exults that he is saved as $nils_krogstad$ has returned the incriminating bond which $torvald_helmer$ immediately burns along with $nils_krogstad$ #letter#
the #letter# is from $nils_krogstad$ yet $torvald_helmer$ demands to read the #letter# and takes it from $nora$ he takes back his harsh words to his wife and tells her that he forgives her
$nora$ realizes that her #husband# is not the strong and gallant #man# she thought he was and that he truly loves himself more than he does $nora$
$torvald_helmer$ explains that when #man# has forgiven his wife it makes him love her all the more since it reminds him that she is totally dependent on him like #child#
he dismisses the fact that $nora$ had to make the agonizing choice between her conscience and his health and ignores her years of secret efforts to free them from the ensuing obligations and the danger of loss of reputation
he preserves his peace of mind by thinking of the incident as mere mistake that she made owing to her foolishness one of her most endearing feminine traits
we must come to final settlement $torvald_helmer$ we have never exchanged one serious word about serious #thing# $nora$ tells $torvald_helmer$ that she is leaving him and in confrontational scene expresses her sense of betrayal and disillusionment
she feels betrayed by his response to the scandal involving $nils_krogstad$ and she says she must get away to understand herself
she says that she has been treated like doll to play with for her whole #life# first by her father and then by him
concerned for the family reputation $torvald_helmer$ insists that she fulfill her duty as wife and mother but $nora$ says that she has duties to herself that are just as important and that she cannot be good mother or wife without learning to be more than plaything
she reveals that she had expected that he would want to sacrifice his reputation for hers and that she had planned to kill herself to prevent him from doing so
she now realizes that $torvald_helmer$ is not at all the kind of person she had believed him to be and that their marriage has been based on mutual fantasies and misunderstandings
$torvald_helmer$ is unable to comprehend $nora$ point of view since it contradicts all that he has been taught about the female mind throughout his #life#
furthermore he is so narcissistic that it is impossible for him to understand how he appears to her as selfish hypocritical and more concerned with public reputation than with actual morality
$nora$ leaves her keys and wedding ring and as $torvald_helmer$ breaks down and begins to cry baffled by what has happened $nora$ then leaves the house slamming the #door# behind her
she says he has never loved her they have become strangers to each other whether or not she ever comes back is never made clear
therefore for it to be considered acceptable and prevent the translator from altering his work ibsen was forced to write an alternative ending for the german premiere
ibsen german agent felt that the original ending would not play well in german theatres in this ending $nora$ is led to her #child# after having argued with $torvald_helmer$
seeing them she collapses and as the curtain is brought down it is implied that she stays ibsen later called the ending disgrace to the original play and referred to it as barbaric outrage
virtually all productions today use the original ending as do nearly all of the film versions of the play a doll house was based on the #life# of laura kieler maiden name laura smith petersen good friend of ibsen
much that happened between $nora$ and $torvald_helmer$ happened to laura and her #husband# victor similar to the events in the play laura signed an illegal loan to save her #husband#
she wrote to ibsen asking for his recommendation of her work to his publisher thinking that the sales of her book would repay her debt
she wanted the #money# to find cure for her #husband# tuberculosis at his refusal she forged check for the #money# at this point she was found out
two years later she returned to her #husband# and #child# at his urging and she went on to become well known danish author living to the age of
ibsen wrote doll house at the point when laura kieler had been committed to the asylum and the fate of this friend of the family shook him deeply perhaps also because laura had asked him to intervene at crucial point in the scandal which he did not feel able or willing to do
in real #life# when victor discovered about laura secret loan he divorced her and had her committed to an asylum instead he turned this #life# situation into an aesthetically shaped successful drama
in the play $nora$ leaves $torvald_helmer$ with head held high though facing an uncertain future given the limitations single women faced in the society of the #time#
kieler eventually rebounded from the shame of the scandal and had her own successful writing career while remaining discontented with sole recognition as ibsen $nora$ years afterwards
ibsen started thinking about the play around may although he did not begin its first draft until year later having reflected on the themes and characters in the intervening period
he visualised its protagonist $nora$ for instance as having approached him one day wearing a blue woollen dress he outlined his conception of the play as modern tragedy in note written in rome on october
a woman cannot be herself in modern society he argues since it is an exclusively male society with laws made by #man# and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from masculine standpoint
it was first published in copenhagen on december in an edition of copies that sold out within month second edition of copies followed on january and third edition of was issued on march
a doll house received its world premiere on december at the royal theatre in copenhagen with betty hennings as $nora$ emil poulsen as $torvald_helmer$ and peter jerndorff as dr writing for the norwegian newspaper folkets avis the critic erik bøgh admired ibsen originality and technical mastery not single declamatory phrase no high dramatics no drop of blood not even tear
ibsen sent fair copy of the completed play to his publisher on september every performance of its run was sold out
another production opened at the royal theatre in stockholm on january while productions in christiania with johanne juell as $nora$ and arnoldus reimers as $torvald_helmer$ and bergen followed shortly after
in germany the actress hedwig niemann raabe refused to perform the play as written declaring i would never leave my #child#
this version was also played in hamburg dresden hanover and berlin although in the wake of protests and lack of success niemann raabe eventually restored the original ending
another production of the original version some rehearsals of which ibsen attended opened on march at the residenz theatre in munich
in great britain the only way in which the play was initially allowed to be given in london was in an adaptation by henry arthur jones and henry herman called breaking butterfly
production of this version opened in flensburg in february this adaptation was produced at the princess theatre march writing in in his book
the foundations of national drama jones says a rough translation from the german version of doll house was put into my hands and was told that if it could be turned into sympathetic play ready opening would be found for it on the london boards
i knew nothing of ibsen but knew great deal of robertson and j byron from these circumstances came the adaptation called breaking butterfly
toward the middle of the action ibsen was thrown to the fishes and $nora$ was saved from suicide rebellion flight and immortality by making faithful old clerk steal her fateful promissory note from $nils_krogstad$ desk
h mencken writes that it was doll house denaturized and dephlogisticated the curtain fell upon happy home before there were two private productions of the play in london in its original form as ibsen wrote it
the first public british production of the play in its regular form opened on june at the novelty theatre starring janet achurch as $nora$ and charles charrington as $torvald_helmer$
one featured george bernard shaw in the role of $nils_krogstad$ achurch played $nora$ again for day run in soon after its london premiere achurch brought the play to australia in
the play was first seen in america in in louisville kentucky helena modjeska acted $nora$ the play made its broadway premiere at the palmer theatre on december starring beatrice cameron as $nora$ $torvald_helmer$

the play was performed by a jewish theater company in march one of their early performances following their december lower manhattan launch
it was first performed in france in in august young vic based on the english language version by simon stephens

in june space arts centre in london staged an adaptation of doll house featuring the discarded alternate ending manaveli toronto staged tamil version of doll house ஒர ம ய
வ on june translated and directed by mr wikneswaran the drama was very well received by the tamil community in toronto and was staged again in few months later
the same stage play was filmed at the beginning of and screened in toronto on may the film was received with very good reviews and the artists were hailed for their performance
now arrangements are being made to screen the film ஒர ம ய வ in london at safari cinema harrow on july a doll house questions the traditional roles of #man# and women in century marriage
to many century europeans this was scandalous the covenant of marriage was considered holy and to portray it as ibsen did was controversial
however the irish playwright george bernard shaw found ibsen willingness to examine society without prejudice exhilarating the swedish playwright august strindberg criticised the play in his volume of essays and short stories getting married
strindberg questioned $nora$ walking out and leaving her #child# behind with #man# that she herself disapproved of so much that she would not remain with him
strindberg also considers that $nora$ involvement with an illegal financial fraud that involved $nora$ forging signature all done behind her #husband# back and then $nora$ lying to her #husband# regarding $nils_krogstad$ blackmail are serious crimes that should raise questions at the end of the play when $nora$ is moralistically judging her #husband#
and strindberg points out that $nora$ complaint that she and $torvald_helmer$ have never exchanged one serious word about serious #thing# is contradicted by the discussions that occur in act one and two
in the last scene she tells her #husband# she has been greatly wronged by his disparaging and condescending treatment of her and his attitude towards her in their marriage as though she were his doll wife and the #child# in turn have become her dolls leading her to doubt her own qualifications to raise her #child#
the reasons $nora$ leaves her #husband# are complex and various details are hinted at throughout the play she is troubled by her #husband# behavior in regard to the scandal of the loaned #money#
she does not love her #husband# she feels they are strangers she feels completely confused and suggests that her issues are shared by many women
george bernard shaw suggests that she left to begin a journey in search of self respect and apprenticeship to #life# and that her revolt is the end of chapter of human history
ibsen was inspired by the belief that a woman cannot be herself in modern society since it is an exclusively male society with laws made by #man# and with prosecutors and judges who assess feminine conduct from masculine standpoint
its ideas can also be seen as having wider application michael meyer argued that the play theme is not women rights but rather the need of every individual to find out the kind of person
in speech given to the norwegian association for women rights in ibsen insisted that he must disclaim the honor of having consciously worked for the women rights movement since he wrote without any conscious thought of making propaganda his task having been the description of humanity
because of the departure from traditional behavior and theatrical convention involved in $nora$ leaving home her act of slamming the #door# as she leaves has come to represent the play itself
he or she really is and to strive to become that person in iconoclasts james huneker noted that slammed #door# reverberated across the roof of the world
