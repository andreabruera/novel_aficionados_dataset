the yellow wallpaper original title the yellow wall #paper# a story is short story by american writer charlotte perkins gilman first published in january in the new england magazine
it is regarded as an important early work of american feminist literature due to its illustration of the attitudes towards mental and physical health of women in the century
narrated in the first person the story is collection of journal entries written by woman whose physician husband $john$ has rented an old mansion for the summer
as form of treatment the unnamed woman is forbidden from working and is encouraged to eat well and get plenty of air so she can recuperate from what he calls temporary nervous depression a slight hysterical tendency diagnosis common to women during that period
forgoing other #room# in the house the couple moves into the upstairs nursery the story details the descent of young woman into madness
her supportive though misunderstanding husband $john$ believes it is in her best interests to go on rest cure after experiencing symptoms of temporary nervous depression
the family spends the summer at colonial mansion that has in the narrator words something queer about it she and her husband move into an upstairs #room# that she assumes was once nursery
her husband chooses for them to sleep there due to its multitude of windows which provide the air so needed in her recovery
in addition to the couple $john$ sister $jennie$ is present she serves as their housekeeper like most nurseries at the time the windows are barred the wallpaper has been torn and the floor is scratched
ultimately though readers are left unsure as to the source of the #room# state leading them to see the ambiguities in the unreliability of the narrator
the narrator devotes many journal entries to describing the wallpaper in the #room# its yellow smell its breakneck #pattern# the missing patches and the way it leaves yellow smears on the skin and clothing of anyone who touches it
she describes how the longer one stays in the bedroom the more the wallpaper appears to mutate especially in the moonlight
the narrator attributes all these to children as most of the damage is isolated to their reach with no stimulus other than the wallpaper the #pattern# and designs become increasingly intriguing to the narrator
she soon begins to see figure in the design and eventually comes to believe that woman is creeping on all fours behind the #pattern#
believing she must try to free the woman in the wallpaper the woman begins to strip the remaining #paper# off the wall
after many moments of tension between $john$ and his sister the story climaxes with the final day in the house on the last day of summer she locks herself in her #room# to strip the remains of the wallpaper
when $john$ arrives home she refuses to unlock the door when he returns with the key he finds her creeping around the #room# circling the walls and touching the wallpaper
she excitedly exclaims i ve got out at last in spite of you and jane causing her husband to faint as she continues to circle the #room# creeping over his inert body each time she passes it believing herself to have become the personification of the woman trapped behind the yellow wallpaper
she highlighted many issues such as the lack of life outside the home and the oppressive forces of the patriarchal society
gilman used her writing to explore the role of women in america during the late and early through her work gilman paved the way for writers such as alice walker and sylvia plath
the yellow wallpaper gilman portrays the narrator insanity as way to protest the medical professional and societal oppression against women at the time
while under the impression that husbands and male doctors were acting with their best interests in mind women were depicted as mentally weak and fragile
women rights advocates of the era believed that the outbreak of this mental instability was the manifestation of their setbacks regarding the roles they were allowed to play in male dominated society
gilman realized that writing became one of the only forms of existence for women at time when they had very few rights
gilman explained that the idea for the story originated in her own experience as patient the real purpose of the story was to reach dr weir mitchell and convince him of the error of his ways
she had suffered years of depression and consulted well known specialist physician who prescribed rest cure which required her to live as domestic life as possible
in women were even discouraged from writing because it would ultimately create an identity and become form of defiance she was forbidden to touch pen pencil or brush and was allowed only two hours of mental stimulation day
after three months and almost desperate gilman decided to contravene her diagnosis along with the treatment methods and started to work again
aware of how close she had come to complete mental breakdown the author wrote the yellow wallpaper with additions and exaggerations to illustrate her own criticism for the medical field
the yellow wallpaper was not intended to drive people crazy but to save people from being driven crazy and it worked
gilman claimed that many years later she learned that mitchell had changed his treatment methods but literary historian julie bates dock has discredited this
mitchell continued his methods and as late as years after the yellow wallpaper was published was interested in creating entire hospitals devoted to the rest cure so that his treatments would be more widely accessible
gilman sent copy to mitchell but never received response she added that this story has been interpreted by feminist critics as condemnation of the male control of the century medical profession
throughout the short story the narrator offers many suggestions to help her get better such as exercising working or socializing with the outside world
her ideas though are dismissed immediately while using language that stereotypes her as irrational and therefore unqualified to offer ideas about her own condition
this interpretation draws on the concept of the domestic sphere that women were held in during this period many feminist critics focus on the degree of triumph at the end of the story
although some claim the narrator slipped into insanity others see the ending as woman assertion of agency in marriage in which she felt trapped
if the narrator were allowed neither to write in her journal nor to read she would begin to read the wallpaper until she found the escape she was looking for
through seeing the women in the wallpaper the narrator realizes that she could not live her life locked up behind bars
at the end of the story as her husband lies on the floor unconscious she crawls over him symbolically rising over him
the emphasis on reading and writing as gendered practices also illustrated the importance of the wallpaper this is interpreted as victory over her husband at the expense of her sanity
in her article feminist criticism the yellow wallpaper and the politics of color in america susan lanser professor at brandeis university praises contemporary feminism and its role in changing the study and the interpretation of literature
the yellow wallpaper was one of many stories that lost authority in the literary world because of an ideology that determined the works content to be disturbing or offensive
lanser argues that the same argument of devastation and misery can be said about the work of edgar allan poe but his work is still printed and studied by academics
critics such as the editor of the atlantic monthly rejected the short story because the yellow wallpaper provided feminists the tools to interpret literature in different ways
lanser argues that the short story was particularly congenial medium for such re vision because the narrator herself engages in form of feminist interpretation when she tries to read the #paper# on her wall
at first she focuses on contradictory style of the wallpaper it is flamboyant while also dull pronounced yet also lame and uncertain
the narrator in the story is trying to find single meaning in the wallpaper she takes into account the #pattern# and tries to geometrically organize them but she is further confused
the wallpaper changes colors when it reflects light and emits distinct odor which the protagonist cannot recognize at night the narrator is able to see woman behind bars within the complex design of the wallpaper
lanser argues that the unnamed woman was able to find a space of text on which she can locate whatever self projection
just like the narrator as reader when one comes into contact with confusing and complicated text one tries to find single meaning
how we were taught to read as lanser puts it is why reader cannot fully comprehend the text the patriarchal ideology had kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories such as the yellow wallpaper
feminists have made great contribution to the study of literature but according to lanser are falling short because if we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers in dominant #pattern# of thought and social practice then perhaps our own #pattern# must also be deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked
martha cutter discusses how in many of charlotte perkins gilman works she addresses this struggle in which male dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women
with the growth of feminist criticism the yellow wallpaper has become fundamental reading in the standard curriculum gilman works challenge the social construction of women in patriarchal medical discourse who are seen as silent powerless and passive
in this time period it was thought that hysteria a disease stereotypically more common in women was result of too much education
it was understood that women who spent time in college or studying were over stimulating their brains and consequently leading themselves into states of hysteria
in fact many of the diseases recognized in women were seen as the result of lack of self control or self rule
different physicians argued that physician must assume tone of authority and that the idea of cured woman is one who is subdued docile silent and above all subject to the will and voice of the physician
hysterical woman is one who craves power and in order for her to be treated for her hysteria she must submit to her physician whose role is to undermine her desires
often women were prescribed bed rest as form of treatment which was meant to tame them and basically keep them imprisoned
at the time in which her works take place between and women were exceedingly defined as lesser than sickly and weak treatments such as this were way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to expected social roles
in her works gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for woman i the rest cure has to do with the way in which her voice is silenced
paula treichler explains in this story diagnosis is powerful and public it is male voice that imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how she is to perceive and talk about the world
the narrator in the yellow wallpaper is not allowed to participate in her own treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her doctor and in this particular story her husband says
the male voice is the one in which forces controls on the female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her
diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician voice and disempower the female patient the yellow wallpaper is sometimes referred to as an example of gothic literature for its themes of madness and powerlessness
pioneering horror author p lovecraft writes in his essay supernatural horror in literature that the yellow wall #paper# rises to classic level in subtly delineating the madness which crawls over woman dwelling in the hideously papered #room# where madwoman was once confined
helen lefkowitz horowitz in her book wild unrest charlotte perkins gilman and the making of the yellow wall #paper# concludes that the story was cri de coeur against stetson and the traditional marriage he had demanded
is one of the finest and strongest tales of horror ever written gilman was attempting to deflect blame to protect gilman daughter katharine and her step mother gilman friend grace channing
horowitz consults the sources of charlotte private life including her daily journals drafts of poems and essays and intimate letters and compares them to the diary accounts of her first husband
she also mines charlotte diaries for notes on her reading and shows how specific poetry fiction and popular science shaped her consciousness and understanding of sex and gender health and illness emotion and intellect
she builds strong case to show that the yellow wall #paper# in its original form did not represent literal protest against mitchell a neurologist gilman received treatment from in and his treatment
as result horowitz makes some bold and compelling arguments rather it emerged from charlotte troubled relationship with her husband walter personified in the story physician
anglican archbishop peter carnley used the story as reference and metaphor for the situation of women in the church in his sermon at the ordination of the first women priests in australia on march in st george cathedral perth
in another interpretation sari edelstein has argued that the yellow wallpaper is an allegory for gilman hatred of the emerging yellow journalism
in demanding traditional wife walter denied charlotte personal freedom squelched her intellectual energy and characterized her illness having created the forerunner in november gilman made it clear
she wished the press to be more insightful and not rely upon exaggerated stories and flashy headlines gilman was often scandalized in the media and resented the sensationalism of the media
the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper within the story parallels gilman relationship to the press the protagonist describes the wallpaper as having sprawling flamboyant #pattern# committing every artistic sin
edelstein argues that given gilman distaste for the yellow press this can also be seen as description of tabloid newspapers of the day
in paula a treichler article escaping the sentence diagnosis and discourse in the yellow wallpaper she places her focus on the relationship portrayed in the short story between women and writing
rather than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as something along the lines of the #pattern# which underlies sexual inequality the external manifestation of neurasthenia the narrator unconscious the narrator situation within patriarchy
treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be symbol to represent discourse and the fact that the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could somewhat express herself
treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing in the story charlotte perkins gilman is defying the sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes
while treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims she writes that closer look at the text suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women language and discourse and the woman found in the wallpaper could be the
in making this claim it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two forms of writing one rather old and traditional and the other new and exciting
this is supported in the fact that $john$ the narrator husband does not like his wife to write anything which is the reason her journal containing the story is kept secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader
a look at the text shows that as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger so too does her language in her journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation
